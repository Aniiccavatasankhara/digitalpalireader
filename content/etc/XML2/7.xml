  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gaggarā (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gaggarā.&lt;/b&gt;-A lotus-pond at Campā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is several times mentioned as staying on the banks of the pond.  On one such occasion Pessa and Kandaraka visited him, and he preached to them the Kandaraka Sutta (M.i.339).  Among others who visited him there are mentioned Bāhuna (A.v.151), Vajjiyamāhita (A.v.189), and Kassapagotta (Vin.i.312).  On one occasion, when the Buddha was staying there, Sāriputta approached him with a large number of the inhabitants of Campā and asked him questions concerning the efficacy of giving alms (A.iv.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another such occasion Sāriputta assembled the monks and preached to them the Dasuttara Sutta (D.iii.272ff).  It was on the banks of the Gaggarā that the Buddha preached the Karandava Sutta (q.v.) on the necessity of getting rid of evil-minded members of the Sangha lest they should corrupt the whole Order (A.iv.168f), and the pond-bank was also the scene of the preaching of the well-known Sonadanda Sutta (D.i.111f).  Once, when the Buddha was at this spot with a large number of monks and lay-followers, Vangīsa came up to him and praised him in a song, pointing out how the Buddha outshone them all (S.i.195; Thag.v.1252; ThagA.ii.210).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pond was called Gaggarā because it owed its origin to a queen of that name.  On its bank was a Campaka-grove where the Buddha stayed during his visits (MA.ii.565; DA.i.279f).  Nearby was a monastery of titthiyas.  (See A.v.189).  The pond, together with that at Jetavana, is given as an example of a very beautiful lotus pond (E g., AA.i.264).  Monks found it a convenient spot for meditation (SNA.i.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gaggarā.&lt;/b&gt;-The queen for whom the lotus pond Gaggarā (q.v.) was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gaggarā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Records the incident of Vangīsa singing the praises of the Buddha on the banks of the Gaggarā pond (S.i.195; cf.  Thag.v.1252).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhabbā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of semi-divine beings who inhabit the Cātumma-hārājika-realm and are the lowest among the devas (D.ii.212).  They are generally classed together with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asuras')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt; and the Nāgas (E.g., A.iv.200, 204, 207).  Beings are born among them as a result of having practised the lowest form of sīla (D.ii.212, 271).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a disgrace for a monk to be born in the Gandhabba-world (D.ii.221, 251, 273f).  The Gandhabbas are regarded as the heavenly musicians, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancasikha,Pañcasikha')"&gt;Pañcasikha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suriyavaccasaa,Suriyavaccasā')"&gt;Suriyavaccasā&lt;/a&gt; and her father &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/timbaru,Timbarū')"&gt;Timbarū&lt;/a&gt; are among their number (D.ii.264).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wait on such devas as Sakka, and the males among them form the masculine counterpart of the accharā, the nymphs.  Their king is &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhatarattha,Dhatarattha')"&gt;Dhatarattha&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the eastern quarter (D.ii.257).  Other chieftains are also mentioned (D.ii.258): Panāda, Opamañña, Sakka's charioteer Mātalī, Cittasena, Nala and Janesabha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gandhabbas are sometimes described as vihangamā (going through the air) (A.ii.39; AA.ii.506).  In the Ātānātiya Sutta (D.iii.203, 204) the Gandhabbas are mentioned among those likely to trouble monks and nuns in their meditations in solitude.  The Buddha says that beings are born among the Gandhabakāyikā devā because they wish to be so; they are described as dwelling in the fragrance of root-wood, of bark and sap, and in that of flowers and scents (S.iii.250f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often stated that the Gandhabbas preside over conception; this is due to an erroneous translation of the word gandhabba in passages (E.g., M.i.157, 265f) dealing with the circumstances necessary for conception (mātāpitaro ca sannipatitā honti, mātā ca utunī hoti, gandhabbo ca paccupatthito hoti).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.481f ) explain that here gandhabba means tatrūpakasatta - tasmim okāse nibbattanako satto - meaning a being fit and ready to be born to the parents concerned.  The Tīkā says that the word stands for gantabba.  See also Gandhabbarājā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girimānanda Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of King Bimbisāra's chaplain and, having seen the might of the Buddha when the Buddha entered Rājagaha, joined the Order.  He lived in a village studying, but one day, when he came to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha, the king asked him to remain, promising to look after him.  The king, however, forgot his promise, and Girimānanda had to live in the open.  The gods, fearing to wet him, stopped rain from falling.  The king, observing the drought and discovering the reason for it, built him a hermitage wherein the Thera put forth effort and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a householder, and when his wife and children died he fled into the forest in grief.  There the Buddha consoled him, and he offered flowers to the Buddha and sang his praises (Thag.vv.325-9; ThagA.i.409ff; Ap.i.330f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Giri Sutta was preached in reference to Girimānanda, when he lay grievously ill.  A.v.108ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giñjakāvasatha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Giñjakāvasatha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached at the Giñjakāvasatha, in answer to a question by Kaccāyana as to how various opinions, low, moderately good and excellent respectively, arise.  S.ii.153.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Giñjakāvasatha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A group of suttas preached at the Giñjakāvasatha in answer to Ananda's questions regarding the destinies of various disciples, men and women, who had died at Nādikā.  The first sutta of the group includes the Dhammādāsa (q.v.).  S.v.356ff; cf.  D.191ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gāmani-Canda Jātaka (No.257)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Ādāsamukha, son of Janasandha, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  Ādāsamukha became king at the age of seven, having successfully solved the problems set him by his courtiers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janasandha had a servant named Gāmani-Canda who, being old, retired when Ādāsamukha came to the throne.  But various mishaps befell Gāmani-Canda, and he was charged on various counts by different people.  As he was being brought to the king to receive punishment, he was asked by several persons to convey messages to the king, and to find out from him solutions for their troubles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king listened to the charges brought against Gāmani and to his explanation of them.  Convinced of Gāmani's innocence, he passed sentences which ultimately brought gain to Gāmani.  The king then proceeded to solve the problems contained in the messages brought by Gāmani.  He gave to Gāmani the village in which he lived, free from all taxes, and there Gāmani lived happily to the end of his days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told by the Buddha to certain monks who had been discussing his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gāmani-Canda is identified with Ananda.  In the story he is referred to also as Gāmani, Canda-Gāmani and Canda.  J.ii.297-310.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gavampati (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gavampati Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  He was a son of a setthi in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the four lay companions of the Thera &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt;, who, when they heard of Yasa's renunciation, imitated him and won arahant-ship.  Later, Gavampati lived in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana,Añjanavana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt; at Sāketa.  One day, when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; visited the Añjanavana, some of the monks accompanying him slept on the sandbanks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhu,Sarabhū')"&gt;Sarabhū&lt;/a&gt;.  The river rose in the night and there was great dismay.  The Buddha sent Gavampati to stem the flood, which he did by his iddhi-power.  The water stopped afar off, looking like a mountain peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii,Sikhī')"&gt;Sikhī&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a huntsman and seeing the Buddha offered him flowers.  Later he built a parasol and a railing for the thūpa of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana,Konāgamana')"&gt;Konāgamana&lt;/a&gt;.  In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a rich house holder possessed of many cattle.  One day he saw an arahant eating his meal in the sun for lack of shade, and built for him a shelter and planted in front of it a sirīsa-tree.  As a result he was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājika')"&gt;Cātummahārājika&lt;/a&gt; world, and his palace was known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/serissaka,Serissaka')"&gt;Serissaka&lt;/a&gt;.  (Vin.i.18f.; Thag.v.38; ThagA.i.103f; VvA.331f; DA.iii.814 gives a slightly different version of the origin of the Serissaka-vimāna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavampati was the teacher of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaga,Mahānāga')"&gt;Mahānāga&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m1_mag,Madhu-Vāsettha')"&gt;Madhu-Vāsettha&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.443).  It is said that the Serissaka-vimāna, occupied by Gavampati, remained in the Cātummahārajika world even after he had left it.  (D.ii.356f; DA.iii.814 says he went there because he found the "climate" (utu) more agreeable.  SNA.i.347 says it was because he, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola,Pindola-bhāradvāja')"&gt;Pindola-bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;, loved his old haunts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There Gavampati often spent his siesta and held conversations with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi,Pāyāsi')"&gt;Pāyāsi&lt;/a&gt;, who sent through him a message to the inhabitants of the earth, that they should profit by the example of him (Pāyāsi) and discriminate in the bestowal of their gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dulvā mentions (Rockhill, p.149f) that after the Buddha's death, when Mahā Kassapa wished to hold a Convocation of the chief monks, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna,Punna')"&gt;Punna&lt;/a&gt; was sent as a special messenger to summon Gavampati, who was then in the Serissaka-vimāna.  But Gavampati did not attend, his death being imminent.  Instead he sent his bowl and three robes as a gift to the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterwards he died, and Punna carried out his funeral rites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavampati is evidently identical with Girinelapūjaka of the Apadāna (ii.457).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Gavampati Sutta below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gavampati.-&lt;/b&gt; The Sāsanavamsa (p.36f) speaks of a Thera by this name, at whose request the Buddha went to Sudhammapura in the Rāmañña country to establish his religion.  In a previous life Gavampati was born of an egg laid by a Nāga maiden who had relations with a vijjā-dhara.  The egg was hatched and a child was born, but it died at the age of ten and was reborn at Mithilā as Gavampati.  He joined the Order at the age of seven and became an arahant.  Later he visited Sudhamma-pura to preach to his mother, and there King Sīha asked him to invite the Buddha to his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gavampati Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached by Gavampati at Sahajāti in the Ceti country.  A number of the senior monks were talking of dukkha, and Gavampati tells them that he knows from the Buddha's own self that whosoever understands dukkha knows all its aspects - its nature, its arising, its cessation and the path thereto.  S.v.436.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godha or Mahānāma Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma visits Godha the Sākiyan at Kapilavatthu and asks him what qualities, possessed by a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;, will secure for him ultimate enlightenment.  There are three, answers Godha-unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  When Godha, in his turn, asks the same question of Mahānāma, the latter answers that there are four, and adds the possession of Āriyan virtues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two seek the Buddha to ask his opinion.  Mahānāma declares to the Buddha that he would accept the Buddha's decision in face of the opinion of everyone else in the universe.  In answer to a question of the Buddha, Godha answers that of a person who holds such a view he has nothing but good to say, the conclusion evidently being that he accepts Mahānāma's opinion in preference to his own.  S.v.371f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Mhv.xxv.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gāmanī.&lt;/b&gt;-A prince, youngest of one hundred brothers.  His story is given in the Samvara Jātaka.  J.iv.130ff; see also J.i.136f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Gāmanī.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the six brothers of Bhaddakaccānā; he remained behind when the others left for Ceylon.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangamāla Jātaka (No.421)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta once took service under Suciparivāra of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, in whose household everyone kept the fast on uposatha-days.  The Bodhisatta, not knowing this, went to work as usual on the fast day, but, on discovering that no one else was working and the reason for their abstention, he refused to take any food, and as a result of his fasting died in the night.  He was reborn as son of the king of Benares, and later became king under the name of Udaya.  On meeting Addhamāsaka (q.v.), Udaya shared the kingdom with him, but one day Addhamāsaka, discovering that he harboured a desire to kill Udaya, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic.  When Udaya heard of this he uttered a stanza, referring to his own past life, but no one could understand the meaning of it.  The queen, anxious to learn the meaning, told the king's barber Gangamāla how he might win the king's favour, and when the king offered him a boon, Gangamāla chose to have the stanza explained to him.  When he learnt how Udaya had won a kingdom as a result of having kept the fast for half a day, Gangamāla renounced the world and, developing asceticism, became a Pacceka Buddha.  Later he visited King Udaya and preached to him and his retinue, addressing the king by name.  The queen-mother took offence at this and abused Gangamāla, but the king begged him to forgive her.  Gangamāla returned to Gandhamādana, though urged by Udaya to stay in the royal park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was Addhamāsaka, and Rāhulamātā was the queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related by the Buddha to some lay-followers to en-courage them in their observance of the Uposatha (J.iii.444ff).  Gangamāla is mentioned as an example of a man who realised the evils of tanhā and renounced desire.  E.g., J.iv.174.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ganaka-Moggallāna Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one hundred and seventh sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya; preached to Ganaka-Moggallāna.  Moggallāna says that the brahmanical training is a thoroughly graduated system (anupub-basikkhā anupubbakiriyā).  Can the Buddha say the same of his teaching? The Buddha says he can and proceeds to explain.  It is true that not all the Buddha's disciples attain to the goal, but the fault is theirs; the Buddha accepts no responsibility, he only indicates the way.  M.iii.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gopālamātā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queen consort of Udena.  She belonged to a poor merchant's family in Telappanāli and had long and beautiful hair, the envy of her friends.  One day, Mahā Kaccāna and seven others visited the village, and she sold her hair for eight kahāpanas, that she might provide the visitors with a meal.  It is said that she recovered her hair immediately on seeing Mahā Kaccāna.  When the Elder reached Ujjeni that very day, by air, he related the incident to King Udena and the king, having sent messengers to fetch Gopālamātā, made her his chief consort.  She gave birth to a son, whom she called Gopāla, after her own father, and thenceforth she herself was called Gopālamātā.  AA.i.118; Mil.291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghosaka-setthi &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(v.l.  Ghosita°)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Kosambī.  Being born as the son of a courtesan, he is cast away on a refuse heap.  A passer-by takes him home, but the Treasurer of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, knowing from an astrologer that the stars showed the birth of a very lucky boy, seeks him out and adopts him.  A few days after, the Treasurer's wife bears him a son, and he therefore plans to kill Ghosaka with the help of a slave woman, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalii,Kālī')"&gt;Kālī&lt;/a&gt;.  All his attempts having failed, he promises a potter one thousand pieces if he will kill the boy.  Ghosita is sent to the potter with a message; on the way he meets his foster-brother, and gives him the message, promising to win for him a game of marbles.  The foster-brother goes to the potter and is killed.  The Treasurer then sends Ghosaka to the superintendent of his hundred villages with a letter ordering that he be killed.  The letter is fastened to the boy's garment.  On the way he stops for a meal at the house of a country-treasurer whose beautiful daughter falls in love with him.  Discovering the letter, she substitutes another to the effect that Ghosaka should be married to her with great festivity and that a two-storied house should be built for them.  The superintendent carries out these orders and the Treasurer falls ill on receiving the news.  He is visited on his death-bed by Ghosaka and his wife, and while trying with his dying breath to say "I do not give him my wealth," by a slip of the tongue he says "I do." Ghosaka becomes a very pious man and is made the Treasurer of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.  Later he meets&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Sāmavatī')"&gt;Sāmavatī&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of his friend &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavatiya,Bhaddavatiya')"&gt;Bhaddavatiya&lt;/a&gt;, adopts her as his daughter and, when the time comes, gives her in marriage to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a past life &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosa,Ghosaka')"&gt;Ghosaka&lt;/a&gt; had been Kotūhalaka of Addilarattha, but left there with his wife and child on account of great poverty.  On the way he cast off the child on account of its being too heavy, but rescued it later in answer to his wife's importunities.  It was as a result of that act that he was cast away in this birth.  Later he was born as a dog and then as Ghosakadevaputta (DhA.i.169ff; PsA.504ff) (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosaka had two colleagues in Kosambī, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kukkuta,Kukkuta')"&gt;Kukkuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pavarika,Pavāriya')"&gt;Pavāriya&lt;/a&gt;.  For a number of years they entertained five hundred ascetics from Himavā, during the rainy season, until one year the ascetics, hearing from a tree-sprite, who had been one of Anāthapindika's labourers, of the arising of the Buddha, informed Ghosaka and his friends of their determination to see the Buddha at Sāvatthi.  The ascetics went on ahead, followed by Ghosaka and the others, bearing all kinds of gifts.  They all heard the Buddha preach, became &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpannas')"&gt;sotāpannas&lt;/a&gt;, and invited the Buddha to Kosambī.  On the invitation being accepted, they built residences for the Buddha and the monks at Kosambī, that built by Ghosaka being called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama,Ghositārāma')"&gt;Ghositārāma&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.203ff; AA.i.234f.; MA.i.539f; PsA.414, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mitta,Mitta')"&gt;Mitta&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.189) was the householder in charge of the refectory from which Ghosaka had food daily distributed to the needy, and Sumana was Ghosaka's gardener (DhA.i.208).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosaka is mentioned as an example of a man possessing puññiddhi.  He could not have been killed even if stabbed in seven places (BuA.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Ghosita Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghotamukha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records a conversation between Udena Thera and Ghotamukha at Khemiyambavana, after the Buddha's death.  Ghotamukha maintains that there is a Recluse who might be called Righteous (dhammiko paribbājo).  Does Udena know of him? Udena describes to him the four types of individuals - those who torture themselves, those who torture others, those who torture both and those who torture neither, the last being those who live beyond appetites, consummate, unfevered and blissful.  They want none of the things after which men hanker, but discarding them all go forth to homelessness.  Ghotamukha admits that such are Righteous Recluses.  M.ii.157ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandatindu Jātaka (No.520)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcāla, king of Kampilla, is a wicked monarch, and his subjects, harassed by his officers, suffer great oppression.  The Bodhisatta, born as the divinity of a gandatindu-tree, becoming aware of this, appears in the king's bedchamber and urges him to give up his evil ways and find out for himself the condition of his subjects.  The king, taking this advice, travels about in disguise with his chaplain.  Everywhere he finds men, women and even the beasts cursing his very name.  He returns to the capital and devotes himself to good works (J.v.98ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory story is given in the Rājovāda Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garudā, Garulā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of mythical birds generally mentioned in company with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga,Nāgas')"&gt;Nāgas&lt;/a&gt; (E.g., J.iv.181, 202).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They live in Simbali-groves (E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397).  The flapping of their wings can raise a storm, known as the Garuda-wind (J.v.77).  This wind can plunge a whole city in darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Garula has strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its roots (J.vi.177).  The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the Nāgas (J.ii.13; iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where Nāgas are to be found.  The greatest happiness of the Nāgas is to be free from the attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463).  A Garula's plumage is so thick that a man - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny,Natakuvera')"&gt;Natakuvera&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.91) - could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird.  Sometimes Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to the Garula city - one of the queens being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sussondii_jat_360,Sussondī')"&gt;Sussondī&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.187) and the other &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327,Kākātī')"&gt;Kākātī&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.91).  In each case the queen, being found unfaithful to her Garula lover, was returned to her husband.  The Garulas know the Ālambāyana spell, which no Nāga can resist (J.vi.178, 184).  It is said that in olden days the Garulas did not know how to seize Nāgas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and the Nāgas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them.  Later the Garulas learnt this secret through the treachery of the ascetic &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/karambiya,Karambiya')"&gt;Karambiya&lt;/a&gt;, as related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandara_jat_518,Pandara Jātaka')"&gt;Pandara Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.175f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garulas are mentioned as sometimes leading virtuous lives, keeping the fast and observing the precepts.  One such was the Garula king mentioned in the Pandara Jātaka, and another, the son of Vināta, who visited the park of Dhanañjaya Koravya and gave a golden garland as present after hearing Vidhurapandita preach (J.vi.261f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garula's body was evidently considered to be specially formed for quick flight, for the ancient proto-type of the aeroplane was based on the Garula (DhA.iii.135).  One of the five guards appointed by Sakka to protect Tāvatimsa from the Asuras was formed of Garulas (J.i.204).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.187) and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.400) were both, on different occasions, born as Garula kings.  The Simbalī is the special tree of the Garula-world (Vsm.i.206).  The Garula is often represented in art as a winged Man.  (See Fergusson: Tree and Serpent Worship, pl.xxvi.1; xxviii.1. etc.; also Gründwedel: Buddhistische Kunst, pp.47-50).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Garulas are sometimes called &lt;b&gt;Supannas&lt;/b&gt; (Suvannas).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giritata (Ghitatāka)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tank built by Aggabodhi II (Cv.xlii.67).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near it was the village of the same name, where Parakkamabāhu I.  once encamped with his army (Cv.lxx.312).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the monks interviewed him on behalf of Gaja-bāhu and persuaded him to restore to the latter his kingdom (Cv.lxx.329f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the village was occupied by Mānābharana and his army (Cv.lxxii.149).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tank was among those repaired by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parakkamabahu,Parakkamabāhu I')"&gt;Parakkamabāhu I&lt;/a&gt;., and from there he carried the canal &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaveri,Kāverī')"&gt;Kāverī&lt;/a&gt;, thus joining &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/giritata,Giritata')"&gt;Giritata&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kadduuravaddhamaana,Kaddūravaddhamāna')"&gt;Kaddūravaddhamāna&lt;/a&gt; tank.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guna Jātaka (No.157)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a Lion, and one day while out hunting he sank into a bog and remained there starving for seven days until rescued by a Jackal.  To show his gratitude the Lion took the Jackal and his wife home with him, and the two animals and their wives lived together, the Lion and the Jackal going out together hunting.  Later on, the Lioness grew jealous of the she-Jackal and tried to frighten her away in the absence of their husbands.  When the Lion heard of this, he told his wife how the Jackal had befriended him in his hour of danger, and thenceforth they all lived happily together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackal is identified with Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a gift made by Ananda.  Once, when he had been preaching to the women of Pasenadi's palace, they gave him five hundred new garments which the king had just presented to them.  The king hearing of this was at first annoyed, but on questioning Ananda he was satisfied that no gift presented to the Sangha could ever be wasted.  Delighted with this discovery, the king himself gave five hundred robes to Ananda, all of which Ananda presented to a young monk who was very useful and helpful to him.  The monk, in his turn, distributed them among his fellow celibates, who wondered why Ananda should have singled out one monk as the recipient of his gifts.  When the matter was related to the Buddha, he assured the monks that the gift was offered to the monk by Ananda only in return for numerous services (J.ii.23ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka is also called Sīha Jātaka, and probably also the Sigāla Jātaka.  E.g., in J.ii.314.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gomaya, or Gomayapindī Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana.  A monk asks the Buddha whether there is any body or anything at all that is permanent and stable.  The Buddha takes a pellet of cow dung in his hand and tells him that the personality in any one span of life (attabhāva) even as small as that pellet is unstable.  The Buddha then tells the monk of the great luxuries he had enjoyed as king (Mahā-Sudassana) of Kusāvati, and of how they all perished (S.iii.143f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was preached by Mahinda at the Nandana grove, on the sixth day after his arrival in Ceylon.  Mhv.xv.197.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gūthakhādi-duttha-brāhmana Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story of a peta, sunk in a dungpit, eating dung with both hands.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he had invited the monks to a meal and set before them a vessel filled with dung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peta was seen near Gijjhakūta by both Mahā Moggallāna and Lakkhana.  S.ii.259.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangārohana Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Culavamsa (Cv.xxxvii.191) mentions a sutta by this name.  The Commentaries on the Dhammapada (DhA.iii.436ff) and the Khuddakapātha (KhpA.162ff) contain accounts of the visit paid by the Buddha to Vesāli in order to drive out from there the fears of famine and pestilence, and they describe in great detail the celebrations which took place as the Buddha returned to Rājagaha along the Ganges.  This journey is called Gangārohana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta mentioned is probably, therefore, the Ratana Sutta (q.v.) which the Buddha preached at Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gotama&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last of the twenty-five Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No comprehensive account of Gotama Buddha is as yet possible.  The details given in this article are those generally accepted by orthodox Theravādins and contained in their books, chiefly the Pāli Commentaries, more especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka and the Buddhavamsa Commentary.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biographical details are also found in the Mahā Vagga and the Culla Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka, the Buddhavamsa and in various scattered passages of the Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka.  References to these are given where considered useful.  Controversy exists with regard to many of the matters mentioned; for discussion of the varying views regarding these, reference should be made to the works of Oldenberg, Rhys Davids (both Professor and Mrs.  Rhys Davids), Kern, E.  J.  Thomas and other scholars.  Further particulars of persons and places mentioned can be obtained by reference to the articles under the respective names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a Sākiyan (the Sākiyans were evidently subjects of the Kosala king; the Buddha calls himself a Kosalan, M.ii.124), son of Suddhodana (all Pāli Commentaries and Sanskrit works represent the Buddha as the son of a king, descendant of a long line of famous ancestors), chief ruler of Kapilavatthu, and of Mahā Māyā, Suddhodana's chief consort, and he belonged to the Gotama-gotta.  Before his conception he was in the Tusita heaven, waiting for the due time for his birth in his last existence.  Then, having made the "five investigations" (pañcavilolcanāni) (see Buddha), he took leave of his companions and descended to earth.  (According to the Lalitavistara he appointed the Bodhisatta Maitreya as king of Tusita in his place).  Many wondrous and marvellous events attended his conception and birth.  (Given in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma Sutta, M.iii.118f; also D.ii.12f.  A more detailed account is found in J.i.47ff; both the Lai.  and the Mtu.ii.14ff differ as to the details given here of the conception and the birth).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conception takes place on the full-moon day of Āsālha, with the moon in Uttarāsālha, and Maya has no relations with her husband.  She has a marvellous dream in which the Bodhisatta, as a white elephant, enters her womb through her side.  When the dream is mentioned to the brahmins, they foretell the birth of a son who will be either a universal monarch or a Buddha.  An earthquake takes place and thirty-two signs appear, presaging the birth of a great being.  The first of these signs is a boundless, great light, flooding every corner of the ten thousand worlds; everyone beholds its glory, even the fires in all hells being extinguished.  Ten months after the conception, in the month of Visākha, Māyā wishes to visit her parents in Devadaha.  On the way thither from Kapilavatthu she passes the beautiful Lumbini grove, in which she desires to wander; she goes to a great sāla-tree and seizes a branch in her hand; labour pains start immediately, and, when the courtiers retire, having drawn a curtain round her, even while standing, she is delivered of the child.  It is the day of the full moon of Visākha; four Mahābrahmas receive the babe in a golden net, and streams of water descend from the sky to wash him.  The boy stands on the earth, takes seven steps north-wards and utters his lion-roar, "I am the chief in the world." On the same day seven other beings were born: the Bodhi-tree, Rāhula's mother (Rāhulamātā, his future wife), the four Treasure-Troves (described at DA.i.284), his elephant, his horse Kanthaka, his charioteer Channa, and Kāludāyī.  The babe is escorted back to Kapilavatthu on the day of his birth and his mother dies seven days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The isi Asita (or Kāladevala), meditating in the Himālaya, learns from the Tāvatimsa gods of the birth of the Buddha, visits Suddhodana the same day and sees the boy, whom they both worship.  Asita weeps for sorrow that he will not live to see the boy's Buddhahood, but he instructs his nephew Nālaka (v.l.  Naradatta) to prepare himself for that great day.  On the fifth day after the birth is the ceremony of name-giving.  One hundred and eight brahmins are invited to the festival at the palace; eight of them - Rāma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Manti, Kondañña, Bhoja, Suyāma and Sudatta - are interpreters of bodily marks, and all except Kondañña prophesy two possibilities for the boy; but Kondañña, the youngest, says, quite decisively, that he will be a Buddha.  The name given to the boy at this ceremony is not actually mentioned, but from other passages it is inferred that it was Siddhattha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other incidents recounted of the Buddha's boyhood is that of his attaining the first jhāna under a jambu-tree.  One day he is taken to the state ploughing of the king where Suddhodana himself, with his golden plough, ploughs with the farmers.  The nurses, attracted by the festivities, leave the child under a jambu-tree.  They return to find him seated, cross-legged, in a trance, the shadow of the tree remaining still, in order to protect him.  The king is informed and, for the second time, does reverence to his son.  J.i.57f; MA.i.466f; the incident is alluded to in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta (M.i.246); the corresponding incident recounted in Mtu.  (ii.45f.) takes place in a park, and the, details differ completely.  The Lai.  has two versions, one in prose and one in verse and both resemble the Mtu.; but in these the Buddha is represented as being much older.  The Divy (391) and the Tibetan versions (e.g., Rockhill, p.22) put the incident very much later in the Buddha's life.  Other incidents are given in Lai.  and Mtu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta is reported to have lived in the household for twenty-nine years a life of great luxury and excessive ease, surrounded by all imaginable comforts.  He owns three palaces - Ramma, Suramma and Subha - for the three seasons.  Mention is made of his luxurious life in A.i.145; also in M.i.504; further details are given in AA.i.378f.; J.i.58. See also Mtu.ii.115; cf.  Vin.i.15; D.ii.21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bodhisatta is sixteen years old, Suddhodana sends messengers to the Sākyans asking that his son be allowed to seek a wife from among their daughters; but the Sākyans are reluctant to send them, for, they say, though the young man is hand-some, he knows no art; how, then, can he support a wife? When this is reported to the prince, he summons an assembly of the Sākyans and performs various feats, chief of these being twelve feats with a bow which needs the strength of one thousand men.  (The feats with the bow are described in the Sarabhanga Jātaka, J.v.129f ).  The Sākyans are so impressed that each sends him a daughter, the total number so sent being forty thousand.  The Bodhisatta appoints as his chief wife the daughter of Suppabuddha, who, later, comes to be called Rāhulamātā.  She is known under various names: Bhaddakaccā (or Kaccānā), Yasodharā.  Bimbā, Bimbasundarī and Gopā.  For a discussion see Rāhulamātā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the generally accepted account, Gotama is twenty-nine when the incidents occur which lead to final renunciation.  Following the prophecy of the eight brahmins, his father had taken every precaution that his son should see no sign of old age, sickness or death.  But the gods decide that the time is come for the Enlightenment, and instil into Gotama's heart a desire to go into the park.  On the way, the gods put before him a man showing signs of extreme age, and the Bodhisatta returns, filled with desire for renunciation.  The king, learning this, surrounds him with even greater attractions, but on two other days Gotama goes to the park and the gods put before him a sick man and a corpse.  (According to some accounts, e.g.  that of the Dīghabhānakas, the four omens were all seen on the same day, J.i.59)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the full-moon day of Āsālha, the day appointed for the Great Renunciation, Gotama sees a monk and hears from his charioteer praise of the ascetic life.  Feeling very happy, he goes to the park to enjoy himself.  Sakka sends Vissakamma himself to bathe and adorn him, and as Gotama returns to the city in all his majesty, he receives news of the birth of his son.  Foreseeing in this news a bond, he decides to call the babe Rāhula (q.v.).  Kisā Gotamī (q.v.) sees Gotama on the way to the palace and, filled with longing for him, sings to him a song containing the word nibbuta.  The significance of the word (=extinguished, at peace) thrills him, and he sends to Kisā his priceless gold necklace which she, however, accepts as a token of love.  Gotama enters the palace and sleeps.  He wakes in the middle of the night to find his female musicians sleeping in attitudes which fill him with disgust and with loathing for the worldly life, and he decides to leave it.  (In some versions the Renunciation takes place seven days after the birth of Rāhula, J.i.62).  He orders Channa to saddle Kanthaka, and enters his wife's room for a last look at her and their son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He leaves the city on his horse Kanthaka, with Channa clinging to its tail.  The devas muffle the sound of the horse's hoofs and of his neighing and open the city gates for Gotama to pass.  Māra appears before Gotama and seeks to stay him with a promise that he shall be universal monarch within seven days.  On his offer being refused, Māra threatens to shadow him always.  Outside the city, at the spot where later was erected the Kanthakanivattana-cetiya, Gotama turns his horse round to take a last look at Kapilavatthu.  It is said that the earth actually turned, to make it easy for him to do so.  Then, accompanied by the gods, he rides thirty leagues through three kingdoms - those of the Sākyans, the Koliyans and the Mallas - and his horse crosses the river Anomā in one leap.  On the other side, he gives all his ornaments to Channa, and with his sword cuts off hair and beard, throwing them up into the air, where Sakka takes them and enshrines them in the Cūlāmani-cetiya in Tāvatimsa.  The Brahmā Ghatikāra offers Gotama the eight requisites of a monk, which he accepts and adopts.  He then sends Channa and Kanthaka back to his father, but Kanthaka, broken-hearted, dies on the spot and is reborn as Kanthaka-devaputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account given here is taken mainly from the Nidānakathā (J.i.59ff) and evidently embodies later tradition; cp.  D.ii.21ff.  From passages found in the Pitakas (e.g., A.i.145; M.i.163, 240; M.ii.212f.) it would appear that the events leading up to the Renunciation were not so dramatic as given here, the process being more gradual.  I do not, however, agree with Thomas (op.  cit., 58) that, according to these accounts, the Bodhisatta left the world when "quite a boy." I think the word dahara is used merely to indicate "the prime of youth," and not necessarily "boyhood." The description of the Renunciation in the Lal.  is very much more elaborate and adds numerous incidents, no account of which is found in the Pāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Anomā the Bodhisatta goes to the mango-grove of Anupiya, and after spending seven days there walks to Rājagaha (a distance of thirty leagues) in one day, and there starts his alms rounds.  Bimbisāra's men, noticing him, report the matter to the king, who sends messengers to enquire who this ascetic is.  The men follow Gotama to the foot of the Pandavapabbata, where he eats his meal, and they then go and report to the king.  Bimbisāra visits Gotama, and, pleased with his hearing, offers him the sovereignty.  On learning the nature of Gotama's quest, he wins from him a promise to visit Rājagaha first after the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident is also mentioned in the Pabbajjā Sutta (SN.vv.405-24), but there it is the king who first sees Gotama.  It is significant that, when asked his identity, Gotama does not say he is a king's son.  The Pali version of tile sutta contains nothing of Gotama's promise to visit Rājagaha, but the Mtu.  version (ii.198-200), which places the visit later, has two verses, one of which contains the request and the other the acceptance; and the SNA.  (ii.385f.), too, mentions the promise and tells that Bimbisāra was informed of the prophecy concerning Gotama.  There is another version of the Mtu.  (ii.117-20) which says that Gotama went straight to Vaisāli after leaving home, joining Ālāra, and later visited Uddaka at Rājagaha.  Here no mention is made of Bimbisāra.  We are told in the Mhv.  (ii.25ff) that Bimbisāra and Gotama (Siddhattha) had been playmates, Bimbisāra being the younger by five years.  Bimbisāra's father (Bhātī) and Suddhodana were friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journeying from Rājagaha, Gotama in due course becomes a disciple of Ālāra-Kālāma.  Having learnt and practised all that Ālāra has to teach, he finds it unsatisfying and joins Uddaka-Rāmaputta; but Uddaka's doctrine leaves him still unconvinced and he abandons it.  He then goes to Senānīgāma in Uruvelā and there, during six years, practises all manner of severe austerities, such as no man had previously undertaken.  Once he falls fainting and a deva informs Suddhodana that Gotama is dead.  But Suddhodana, relying on the prophecy of Kāladevala, refuses to believe the news.  Gotama's mother, now born as a devaputta in Tāvatimsa, comes to him to encourage him.  At Uruvelā, the Pañcavaggiya monks are his companions, but now, having realised the folly of extreme asceticism, he decides to abandon it, and starts again to take normal food; thereupon the Pañcavaggiyas, disappointed, leave him and go to Isipatana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.66f.  The Therīgāthā Commentary (p.2) mentions another teacher of Gotama, named Bhaggava, whom Gotama visited before Ālāra.  Lal.  (330 [264]) contains a very elaborate account of Gotama's visits to teachers; he goes first to two brahmin women, Sākī and Padmā, then to Raivata and Rajaka, son of Trimandika, and finally (as far as this chapter is concerned) to Ālāra at Vaisāli.  A poem containing an account of the meeting of Gotama with Bimbisāra is inserted into this account.  The next chapter tells of Uddaka.  An account of Gotama's visits to teachers and of the details of his austerities is also given in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta, already referred to (M.i.240ff); the Mahā Sīhanāda Sutta (M.i.77ff) contains a long and detailed account of his extreme asceticisms.  See also M.i.163ff; ii.93f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama's desire for normal food is satisfied by an offering brought by Sujātā to the Ajapāla banyan tree under which he is seated.  She had made a vow to the tree, and her wish having been granted, she takes her slave-girl, Punnā, and goes to the tree prepared to fulfil her promise.  They take Gotama to be the Tree-god, come in person to accept her offering of milk-rice; the offering is made in a golden bowl and he takes it joyfully.  Five dreams he had the night before convince Gotama that he will that day become the Buddha.  (The dreams are, recounted in A.iii.240 and in Mtu.ii.136f).  It is the full-moon day of Visākha; he bathes at Suppatittha in the Nerañjarā, eats the food and launches the bowl up stream, where it sinks to the abode of the Nāga king, Kāla (Mahākāla).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama spends the rest of the day in a sāla-grove and, in the evening, goes to the foot of the Bodhi-tree, accompanied by various divinities; there the grass-cutter Sotthiya gives him eight handfuls of grass; these, after investigation, Gotama spreads on the eastern side of the tree, where it becomes a seat fourteen hands long, on which he sits cross-legged, determined not to rise before attaining Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.69. The Pitakas know nothing of Sujātā's offering or of Sotthiya's gift.  Lal.  (334-7 [267-70]) mentions ten girls in all who provide him with food during his austerities.  Divy (392) mentions two, Nandā and Nandabalā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māra, lord of the world of passion, is determined to prevent this fulfilment, and attacks Gotama with all the strength at his command.  His army extends twelve leagues to the front, right, and left of him, to the end of the Cakkavāla behind him, and nine leagues into the sky above him.  Māra himself carries numerous weapons and rides the elephant Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height.  At the sight of him all the divinities gathered at the Bodhi-tree to do honour to Gotama - the great Brahmā, Sakka, the Nāga-king Mahākāla - disappear in a flash, and Gotama is left alone with the ten pāramī, long practised by him, as his sole protection.  All Māra's attempts to frighten him by means of storms and terrifying apparitions fail, and, in the end, Māra hurls at him the Cakkāvudha.  It remains as a canopy poised over Gotama.  The very earth bears witness to Gotama's fitness to be the Enlightened One, and Girimekhala kneels before him.  Māra is vanquished and flees headlong with his vast army.  The various divinities who had fled at the approach of Māra now return to Gotama and exult in his triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole story of the contest with Māra is, obviously, a mythological development.  It is significant that in the Majjhima passages referred to earlier there is no mention of Māra, of a temptation, or even of a Bodhi-tree; but see D.ii.4 and Thomas (op.  cit., n.1).  According to the Kālingabodhi Jātaka, which, very probably, embodies an old tradition, the bodhi-tree was worshipped even in the Buddha's life-time.  The Māra legend is, however, to be found in the Canonical Padhāna Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta.  This perhaps contains the first suggestion of the legend.  For a discussion see Māra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama spends that night in deep meditation.  In the first watch he gains remembrance of his former existences; in the middle watch he attains the divine eye (dibbacakkhu); in the last watch he revolves in his mind the Chain of Causation (paticcasamuppāda).  As he masters this, the earth trembles and, with the dawn, comes Enlightenment.  He is now the supreme Buddha, and he breaks forth into a paean of joy (udāna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is great doubt as to which were these Udāna verses.  The Nidānakathā and the Commentaries generally quote two verses (153, 154) included in the Dhammapada collection (anekajāti samsāram, etc.).  The Vinaya (i.2) quotes three different verses (as does also DhsA.17), and says that one verse was repeated at the end of each watch, all the watches being occupied with meditation on the paticcasamuppāda.  Mtu.  (ii.286) gives a completely different Udāna, and in another place (ii.416) mentions a different verse as the first Udāna.  The Tibetan Vinaya is, again, quite different (Rockhill, p.33).  For a discussion see Thomas, op.  cit., 75ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first week the Buddha remains under the Bodhi-tree, meditating on the Paticcasamuppāda; the second week he spends at the Ajapālanigrodha, where the "Huhuhka" Brahmin accosts him (Mara now comes again and asks the Buddha to die at once; D.ii.112) and where Mara's daughters, Tanhā, Aratī and Rāgā, appear before the Buddha and make a last attempt to shake his resolution (J.i.78; S.i.124; Lal.490 (378)); the third week he spends under the hood of the nāga-king Mucalinda (Vin.i.3); the fourth week is spent in meditation under the Rājāyatana tree*; at the end of this period takes place the conversion of Tapussa and Bhallika.  They take refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, though the Buddha does not give them any instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*This is the Vinaya account (Vin.i.1ff); but the Jātaka (i.77ff, extends this period to seven weeks, the additional weeks being inserted between the first and second.  The Buddha spends one week each at the Animisa-cetiya, the Ratanacankama and the Ratanaghara, and this last is where he thinks out the Abhidhamma Pitaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubts now assail the Buddha as to whether he shall proclaim to the world his doctrine, so recondite, so hard to understand.  The Brahma Sahampati (according to J.i.81, with the gods of the thousand worlds, including Sakka, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimmita, Vasavatti, etc.) appears before him and assures him there are many prepared to listen to him and to profit by his teaching, and so entreats him to teach the Dhamma.  The Buddha accedes to his request and, after consideration, decides to teach the Dhamma first to the Pañcavaggiyas at Isipatana.  On the way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; he meets the Ājīvaka Upaka and tells him that he (the Buddha) is Jina.  On his arrival at Isipatana the Pañcavaggiyas are, at first, reluctant to acknowledge his claim to be the Tathāgata, but they let themselves be won over and, on the full-moon day of Āsālha, the Buddha preaches to them the sermon which came to be known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.  (Vin.i.4ff; M.i.118ff; cp.  D.ii.36ff.  Regarding the claim of this sutta to be the Buddha's first sermon, see Thomas, op.  cit., p.86; see also Pañcavaggiyā).  At the end of the sermon Kondañña becomes a sotāpanna and they all become monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sermon is followed five days later by the Anattalakkhana Sutta, at the conclusion of which all five become arahants.  The following day the Buddha meets Yasa, whom he converts.  Yasa's father, who comes seeking him, is the first to take the threefold formula of Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa becomes an arahant and is ordained.  The Buddha accepts a meal at his house, and Yasa's mother and one of his former wives are the first two lay-women to become the Buddha's disciples.  Then four friends of Yasa and, afterwards, fifty more, enter the Order and become arahants.  There are now sixty arahants besides the Buddha, and they are sent in different directions to preach the Dhamma.  They return with many candidates for admission to the Order, and the Buddha, who up till now had ordained men with the "ehi bhikkhu" formula, now allows the monks themselves to perform the ceremony of ordination (Vin.i.15ff; J.i.81f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending the rainy season at Benares (about this time Māra twice tries to tempt the Buddha, once after he had sent the disciples out to preach and once after the Retreat, S.i.105, 111; Vin.i.21, 22), the Buddha returns to Senānigāma in Uruvela, on the way converting and ordaining the thirty Bhaddavaggiyā.  At Uruvela, after a long and protracted exercise of magical powers, consisting in all of three thousand five hundred miracles, the Buddha wins over the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhātika Jatilā, with their thousand followers, and ordains them.  They become arahants after listening to the Ādittapariyāya Sutta preached at Gayāsīsa; with these followers he visits Rājagaha, where King Seniya Bimbisāra comes to see him at the Latthivanuyyāna.  The following day the Buddha and the monks visit the palace, preceded by Sakka disguised as a youth and singing the praises of the Buddha.  After the meal, the king gifts Veluvana to the Buddha and the Order.  The Buddha stays for two months at Rājagaha (BuA.4), and it is during this time that Sāriputta and Moggallāna join the Order, through the instrumentality of Assaji (Vin.i.23ff).  It was probably during this year, at the beginning of the rainy season, that the Buddha visited Vesāli at the request of the Licchavis, conveyed through Mahāli.  The city was suffering from pestilence and famine.  The Buddha went, preached the Ratana Sutta and dispelled all dangers (DhA.iii.436ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of converts now rapidly increases and the people of Magadha, alarmed by the prospect of childlessness, widow-hood, etc., blame the Buddha and his monks.  The Buddha, however, refutes their charges (Vin.i.42f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account of the first twenty years of the Buddha's ministry is summarised from various sources, chiefly from Thomas's admirable account in his Life and Legend of the Buddha (pp.97ff).  The necessary references are to be found under the names mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the full-moon day of Phagguna (February-March) the Buddha, accompanied by twenty thousand monks, sets out for Kapilavatthu at the express request of his father, conveyed through Kāludāyī.  (This visit is not mentioned in the Canon; but see Thag.527-36; AA.i.107, 167; J.i.87; DhA.i.96f; ThagA.i.997ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By slow stages he arrives at the city, where he stays at the Nigrodhārāma, and, in order to convince his proud kinsmen of his power, performs the Yamakapātihārjya and then relates the Vessantara Jātaka.  The next day, receiving no invitation to a meal, the Buddha begs in the streets of the city; this deeply grieves Suddhodana, but later, learning that it is the custom of all Buddhas, he becomes a sotāpanna and conducts the Buddha and his monks to meal at the palace.  There all the women of the palace, excepting only Rāhulamātā, come and do reverence to the Buddha.  Mahā Pajāpatī becomes a sotāpanna and Suddhodana a sakadāgāmi.  The Buddha visits Rāhulamātā in her own apartments and utters her praises in the Candakinnara Jātaka.  The following day the Buddha persuades his half-brother, Nanda, to come to the monastery, where he ordains him and, on the seventh day, he does the same with Rāhula.  This is too great a blow for Suddhodana, and at his request the Buddha rules that no person shall be ordained without the consent of his parents.  The next day the Buddha preaches to Suddhodana, who becomes an anāgāmī.  During the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sākyans join the Order, one from each family.  With these he returns to Rājagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiya, where Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, together with their barber, Upāli, visit him and seek ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his return to Rājagaha the Buddha resides in the Sītavana.  (J.i.92, the story is also told in the Vinaya ii.154, but no date is indicated).  There Sudatta, later known as Anāthapindika, visits him, is converted, and invites him to Sāvatthi.  The Buddha accepts the invitation and journeys through Vesāli to Sāvatthi, there to pass the rainy season.  (Vin.ii.158; but see BuA.3, where the Buddha is mentioned as having spent the vassa in Rājagaha).  Anāthapindika gifts Jetavana, provided with every necessity, for the residence of the Buddha and his monks.  Probably to this period belongs the conversion of Migāra, father-in-law of Visākhā, and the construction, by Visākhā, of the Pubbārāma at Sāvatthi.  The vassa of the fourth year the Buddha spends at Veluvana, where he converts Uggasena.  (DhA.iv.59f).  In the fifth year Suddhodana dies, having realised arahant-ship, and the Buddha flies through the air, from the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli where he was staying, to preach to his father on his death-bed.  According to one account it is at this time that the quarrel breaks out between the Sākyans and the Koliyans regarding the irrigation of the river Rohinī.  (AA.i.186; SNA.i.357; ThigA.141; details of the quarrel are given in J.v.412ff).  The Buddha persuades them to make peace, and takes up his abode in the Nigrodhārāma.  Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī, with other Sākiyan women, visits him there and asks that women may be allowed to join the Order.  Three times the request is made, three times refused, the Buddha then returning to Vesāli.  The women cut off their hair, don yellow robes and follow him thither.  Ananda intercedes on their behalf and their request is granted.  (Vin.ii.253ff; A.iv.274f.; for details see Mahā Pajāpati).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sixth year the Buddha again performs the Yamakapātihāriya, this time at the foot of the Gandamba tree in Sāvatthi.  Prior to this, the Buddha had forbidden any display of magic powers, but makes an exception in his own case (DhA.iii.199f.; J.iv.265, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spends the vassa at Mankulapabbata.  After the performance of the miracle he follows the custom of all Buddhas and ascends to Tāvatimsa in three strides to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother who is born there as a deva, and there he keeps the seventh vassa.  The multitude, gathered at Sāvatthi at the Yamakapātihāriya, refuse to go away until they have seen him.  For three months, therefore, Moggallāna expounds to them the Dhamma, while Culla Anāthapindika provides them with food.  During the preaching of the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta visits the Buddha daily and learns from him all that has been recited the previous day.  At the end of the vassa, the Buddha descends a jewelled staircase and comes to earth at Sankassa, thirty leagues from Sāvatthi.  (For details see Devorohana).  It was about this time, when the Buddha's fame was at its height, that the notorious Ciñcā-mānavikā was persuaded by members of some hostile sect to bring a vile accusation against the Buddha.  A similar story, told in connection with a paribbājikā named Sundarī, probably refers to a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighth year the Buddha spends in the country of the Bhaggas and there, while residing in Bhesakalāvana near Sumsumāragiri, he meets Nakulapitā and his wife, who had been his parents in five hundred former births (A.A.i.217).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is told of another old couple in Sāketa.  See the Sāketa Jātaka.  The Buddha evidently stayed again at Sumsumāragiri many years later.  It was during his second visit that Bodhirājakumāra (q.v.) invited him to a meal at his new palace in order that the Buddha might consecrate the building by his presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ninth year the Buddha is at Kosambī.  While on a visit to the Kuru country he is offered in marriage Māgandiyā, the beautiful daughter of the brahmin Māgandiyā.  The refusal of the offer, accompanied by insulting remarks about physical beauty, arouses the enmity of Māgandiyā who, thenceforward, cherishes hatred against the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SN., pp.163ff; SNA.ii.542ff; DhA.i.199ff Thomas (op.  cit., 109) assigns the Māgandiyā incident to the ninth year.  I am not sure if this is correct, for the Commentaries say the Buddha was then living at Sāvatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tenth year there arises among the monks at Kosambī a schism which threatens the very existence of the Order.  The Buddha, failing in his attempts to reconcile the disputants, retires in disgust to the Pārileyyaka forest, passing on his way through Bālakalonakāragāma and Pācīnavamsadāya.  In the forest he is protected and waited upon by a friendly elephant who has left the herd.  The Buddha spends the rainy season there and returns to Sāvatthi.  By this time the Kosambī monks have recovered their senses and ask the Buddha's pardon.  This is granted and the dispute settled.  (Vin.i.337ff; J.iii.486f; DhA.i.44ff; but see Ud.iv.5; s.v.  Pārileyyaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the eleventh year the Buddha resides at the brahmin village of Ekanālā and converts Kasi-Bhāradvāja (SN., p.12f.; S.i.172f).  The twelfth year he spends at Verañjā, keeping the vassa there at the request of the brahmin Verañja.  But Verañja forgets his obligations; there is a famine, and five hundred horse-merchants supply the monks with food.  Moggallāna's offer to obtain food by means of magic power is discouraged (Vin.iii.1ff; J.iii.494f; DhA.ii.153).  The thirteenth Retreat is kept at Cālikapabbata, where Meghiya is the Buddha's personal attendant (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1).  The fourteenth year is spent at Sāvatthi, and there Rāhula receives the upasampadā ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifteenth year the Buddha revisits Kapilavatthu, and there his father-in-law, Suppabuddha, in a drunken fit, refuses to let the Buddha pass through the streets.  Seven days later he is swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his palace (DhA.iii.44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief event of the sixteenth year, which the Buddha spent at Ālavī, is the conversion of the yakkha Ālavaka.  In the seventeenth year the Buddha is back at Sāvatthi, but he visits Ālavī again out of compassion for a poor farmer who becomes a sotāpanna after hearing him preach (DhA.iii.262ff).  He spends the rainy season at Rājagaha.  In the next year he again comes to Ālavī from Jetavana for the sake of a poor weaver's daughter.  She had heard him preach, three years earlier, on the desirability of meditating upon death.  She alone gave heed to his admonition and, when the Buddha knows of her imminent death, he journeys thirty leagues to preach to her and establish her in the sotāpattiphala (DhA.iii.170ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Retreat of this year and also that of the nineteenth are spent at Cālikapabbata.  In the twentieth year takes place the miraculous conversion of the robber Angulimāla.  He becomes an arahant and dies shortly after.  It is in the same year that Ananda is appointed permanent attendant on the Buddha, a position which he holds to the end of the Buddha's life, twenty-five years later (For details see Ananda).  The twentieth Retreat is spent at Rājagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our present knowledge it is impossible to evolve any kind of chronology for the remaining twenty-five years of the Buddha's life.  The Commentaries state that they were spent at Sāvatthi in the monasteries of Jetavana and Pubbārāma.  (E.g., BuA.3; SNA.  p.336f, says that when the Buddha was at Sāvatthi, he spent the day at the Migāramātupāsāda in the Pubbārāma, and the night at Jetavana or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, probably, only implies that the Retreats were kept there and that they were made the head quarters of the Buddha.  From there, during the dry season, he went every year on tour in various districts.  Among the places visited by him during these tours are the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggālavacetiya, Anotatta, Andhakavinda, Ambapālivana, Ambalatthikā, Ambasandā, Assapura, Āpana, Icchānangala, Ukkatthā (Subhagavana), Ukkācelā, Ugganagara, Ujuññā (Kannakatthaka deer-park), Uttara in Koliya, Uttarakā, Uttarakuru, Uruvelakappa, Ulumpa, Ekanālā, Opasāda, Kakkarapatta, Kajangalā (Mukheluvana), Kammāssadhamma, Kalandakanivāpa (near Benares), Kimbilā, Kītāgiri, Kundadhānavana (near Kundakoli), Kesaputta, Kotigāma, Kosambī (Ghositārāma and Badarikārāma), Khānumata, Khomadussa, Gosingasālavana, Candalakappa, Campā (Gaggarā), Cātuma, Cetiyagiri in Vesāli, Jīvakambavana (in Rājagaha), Tapodārāma, Tindukkhānu (paribbājakārāma), Todeyya, Thullakotthita, Dakkhināgiri, Dandakappa, Devadaha, Desaka in the Sumbha country, Nagaraka, Nagaravinda, Nādikā (Giñjakāvasatha), Nālandā (Pāvārika mango-grove), Nālakapāna (Palāsavana), Pankadhā, Pañcasalā, Pātikārāma, Beluva, the Brahma world, Bhaddavatī, Bhaddiya (Jātiyāvana), Bhaganagara (Anandacetiya), Maninālakacetiya, Mana-sākata, Mātulā, Mithilā (Makhādeva mango-grove), Medatalumpa, Moranivāpa, Rammaka's hermitage, Latthivana, Videha, Vedhañña-ambavana, Venāgapura, Verañjā, Veludvāra, Vesāli (also various shrines there, Udenacetiya, Gotamacetiya, Cāpalacetiya, Bahuputta-kacetiya, Sattambacetiya, Sārandadacetiya), Sakkara, Sajjanela, Salalāgāraka in Sāvatthi, Sāketa (Añjanavana), Sāmagāma, Sālavatikā, Sālā, Simsapāvana, Silāvatī, Sītavana, Sūkarakhatalena, Setavyā, Hatthigāma, Halidavassana and the region of the Himālaya.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a more or less continuous account of the last year of the Buddha's life.  This is contained in three suttas: the Mahā Parinibbāna, the Mahā Sudassana and the Janavasabha.  These are not separate discourses but are intimately connected with each other.  The only event prior to the incidents recounted in these suttas, which can be fixed with any certainty, is the death of the Buddha's pious patron and supporter, Bimbisāra, which took place eight years before the Buddha's Parinibbāna (Mhv.ii.32).  It was at this time that Devadatta tried to obtain for himself a post of supremacy in the Order, and, failing in this effort, became the open enemy of the Buddha.  Devadatta's desire to deprive the Buddha of the leadership of the Sangha seems to have been conceived by him, according to the Vinaya account (Vin.ii.184), almost immediately after he joined the Order, and the Buddha was warned of this by the devaputta Kakudha.  This account lends point to the statement contained especially in the Northern books, that even in their lay life Devadatta had always been Gotama's rival.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlisting the support of Ajātasattu, he tried in many ways to kill the Buddha.  Royal archers were bribed to shoot the Buddha, but they were won over by his personality and confessed their intentions.  Then Devadatta hurled a great rock down Gijjhakūta on to the Buddha as he was walking in the shade of the hill; the hurtling rock was stopped by two peaks, but splinters struck the Buddha's foot and caused blood to flow; he suffered great pain and had to be taken to the Maddakucchi garden, where his injuries were dressed by the physician Jīvaka (S.i.27).  The monks wished to provide a guard, but the Buddha reminded them that no man had the power to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta next bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nālāgiri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms.  The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda, against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power, including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him.  As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle.  (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These attempts to encompass the Buddha's death having failed, Devadatta, with three others, decides to create a schism in the Order and asks the Buddha that five rules should be laid down, whereby the monks would be compelled to lead a far more austere life than hitherto.  When this request is refused, Devadatta persuades five hundred recently ordained monks to leave Vesāli with him and take up their residence at Gayāsīsa, where he would set up an organisation similar to that of the Buddha.  But, at the Buddha's request, Sāriputta and Moggallāna visit the renegade monks; Sāriputta preaches to them and they are persuaded to return.  When Devadatta discovers this, he vomits hot blood and lies ill for nine months.  When his end approaches, he wishes to see the Buddha, but he dies on the way to Jetavana - whither he is being conveyed in a litter - and is born in Avīci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Gijjhakūta, near Rājagaha, the Buddha starts on his last journey.  Just before his departure he is visited by Vassākāra, and the talk is of the Vajjians; the Buddha preaches to Vassākāra and the monks on the conditions that lead to prosperity.  The Buddha proceeds with a large concourse of monks to Ambalatthikā and thence to Nālandā, where Sāriputta utters his lion-roar (sīhanāda) regarding his faith in the Buddha.  The Buddha then goes to Pātaligāma, where he talks to the villagers on the evil consequences of immorality and the advantages of morality.  He utters a prophecy regarding the future greatness of Pātaliputta and then, leaving by the Gotamadvāra, he crosses the river Ganges at Gotamatittha.  He proceeds to Kotigāma and thence to Ñātika, where he gives to Ananda the formula of the Dhammādāsa, whereby the rebirth of disciples could be ascertained.  From Ñātika he goes to Vesāli, staying in the park of the courtesan Ambapāli.  The following day he accepts a meal from Ambapāli, refusing a similar offer from the Licchavis; Ambapāli makes a gift of her park to the Buddha and his monks.  The Buddha journeys on to Beluva, where he spends the rainy season, his monks remaining in Vesāli.  At Beluva he falls dangerously ill but, with great determination, fights against his sickness.  He tells Ananda that his mission is finished, that when he is dead the Order must maintain itself, taking the Dhamma alone as its refuge, and he concludes by propounding the four subjects of mindfulness (D.ii.100).  The next day he begs in Vesāli and, with Ananda, visits the Cāpāla-cetiya.  There he gives to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live until the end of the kappa, but Ananda fails to take the hint.  Soon afterwards Māra visits the Buddha and obtains the assurance that the Buddha's nibbāna will take place in three months.  There is an earthquake, and, in answer to Ananda's questions, the Buddha explains to him the eight causes of earthquakes.  This is followed by lists of the eight assemblies, the eight stages of mastery and the eight stages of release.  The Buddha then repeats to Ananda his conversation with Māra, and Ananda now makes his request to the Buddha to prolong his life, but is told that it is now too late; several opportunities he has had, of which he has failed to avail himself.  The monks are assembled in Vesāli, in the Service Hall, and the Buddha exhorts them to practise the doctrines he has taught, in order that the religious life may last long.  He then announces his impending death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.549), after the rainy season spent at Beluva, the Buddha goes back to Jetavana, where he is visited by Sāriputta, who is preparing for his own Parinibbāna at Nālakagāma.  From Jetavana the Buddha went to Rājagaha, where Mahā-Moggallāna died.  Thence he proceeded to Ukkācelā, where he spoke in praise of the two chief disciples.  From Ukkācelā he proceeded to Vesāli and thence to Bhandagāma.  Rāhula, too, predeceased the Buddha (DA.ii.549).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, returning from Vesāli, he looks round at the city for the last time and goes on to Bhandagāma; there he preaches on the four things the comprehension of which destroys rebirth-noble conduct, earnestness in meditation, wisdom and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then passes through the villages of Hatthigāma, Ambagāma and Jambugama, and stays at Bhoganagara at the Ananda-cetiya.  There he addresses the monks on the Four Great Authorities (Mahāpadesā), by reference to which the true doctrine may be determined (Cf.  A.ii.167ff).  From Bhoganagara the Buddha goes to Pāvā and stays in the mango-grove of Cunda, the smith.  Cunda serves him with a meal which includes sūkaramaddava.  (There is much dispute concerning this word.  See Thomas, op.  cit., 149, n.3).  The Buddha alone partakes of the sūkaramaddava, the remains being buried.  This is the Buddha's last meal; sharp sickness arises in him, with flow of blood and violent, deadly pains, but the Buddha controls them and sets out for Kusinārā.  On the way he has to sit down at the foot of a tree.  Ananda fetches him water to drink from the stream Kakutthā, over which five hundred carts had just passed; but, through the power of the Buddha, the water is quite clear.  Here the Buddha is visited by Pukkusa, the Mallan, who is converted and presents the Buddha with a pair of gold-coloured robes.  The Buddha puts them on and Ananda notices the marvellous brightness and clearness of the Buddha's body.  The Buddha tells him that the body of a Buddha takes on this hue on the night before his Enlightenment and on the night of his passing away, and that he will die that night at Kusinārā.  He goes to the Kākutthā, bathes and drinks there and rests in a mango-grove.  There he instructs Ananda that steps must be taken to dispel any remorse that Cunda may feel regarding the meal he gave to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Kakutthā the Buddha crosses the Hiraññavatī to the Upavattana sāla-grove in Kusinārā.  There Ananda prepares for him a bed with the head to the north.  All the trees break forth into blossom and flowers cover the body of the Buddha.  Divine mandārava-flowers and sandalwood powder fall from the sky, and divine music and singing sound through the air.  But the Buddha says that the greater honour to him would be to follow his teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gods of the ten thousand world systems assemble to pay their last homage to the Buddha, and Upavāna, who stands fanning him, is asked to move away as he obstructs their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda asks for instruction on several points, including how the funeral rites should be performed; he then goes out and abandons himself to a fit of weeping; the Buddha sends for him, consoles him and speaks his praises.  Ananda tries to persuade the Buddha not to die in a mud-and-wattle village, such as is Kusinārā, but the Buddha tells him how it was once the mighty Kusāvatī, capital of Mahāsudassana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mallas of Kusināra are informed that the Buddha will pass away in the third watch of the night, and they come with their families to pay their respects.  The ascetic Subhadda comes to see the Buddha and is refused admission by Ananda, but the Buddha, overhearing, calls him in and converts him.  Several minor rules of discipline are delivered, including the order for the excommunication of Channa.  The Buddha finally asks the assembled monks to speak out any doubts they may have.  All are silent and Ananda expresses his astonishment, but the Buddha tells him it is natural that the monks should have no doubts.  Then, addressing the monks for the last time, he admonishes them in these words: "Decay is inherent in all component things; work out your salvation with diligence." These were the Buddha's last words.  Passing backwards and forwards through various stages of trance, he attains Parinibbāna.  There is a great earthquake and terrifying thunder, and the Brahmā Sahampati, Sakka king of the gods, Anuruddha and Ananda utter stanzas, each proclaiming the feeling uppermost in his mind.  It is the full-moon day of the month of Visākha and the Buddha is in his eightieth year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Ananda informs the Mallas of Kusinārā of the Buddha's death, and for seven days they hold a great celebration.  On the seventh day, following Ananda's instructions, they prepare the body for cremation, taking it in procession by the eastern gate to the Makutabandhana shrine, thus altering their proposed route, in order to satisfy the wishes of the gods, as communicated to them by Anuruddha.  The whole town is covered knee-deep with mandārava-flowers, which fall from the sky.  When, however, four of the chief Mallas try to light the pyre, their attempt is unsuccessful and they must wait until Mahā Kassapa, coming with a company of five hundred monks, has saluted it.  The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.603) add that Mahā Kassapa greatly desired that the Buddha's feet should rest on his head when he worshipped the pyre.  The wish was granted: the feet appeared through the pyre, and when Kassapa had worshipped them, the pyre closed together.  The pyre burns completely away, leaving no cinders nor soot.  Streams of water fall from the sky to extinguish it and the Mallas pour on it scented water.  They then place a fence of spears around it and continue their celebrations for seven days.  At the end of that period there appear several claimants for the Buddha's relics: Ajātasattu, the Licchavis of Vesāli, the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of Rāmagāma, a brahmin of Vethadīpa and the Mallas of Pāvā.  But the Mallas of Kusinārā refusing to share the relics with the others, there is danger of war.  Then the brahmin Dona counsels concord and divides the relics into eight equal parts for the eight claimants.  Dona takes for himself the measuring vessel and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana, who arrive late, carry off the ashes.  Thūpas were built over these remains and feasts held in honour of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concluding passage of the Mahā-Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.167) states that the Buddha's relics were eight measures, seven of which were honoured in Jambudīpa and the remaining one in the Nāga realm in Rāmagāma.  One tooth was in heaven, one in Gandhāra, a third in Kālinga (later taken to Ceylon), and a fourth in the Nāga world.  Ajātasattu's share was deposited in a thūpa and forgotten.  It was later discovered by Asoka (with the help of Sakka) and distributed among his eighty-four thousand monasteries.  Asoka also recorded the finding of all the other relics except those deposited in Rāmagāma.  These were later deposited in the Mahācetiya at Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxi.17ff).  Other relics are also mentioned, such as the Buddha's collar-bone, his alms bowl, etc.  (Mhv.xvii.9ff; Mhv.i.37, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (E.g., DA.iii.899) that just before the Buddha's Sāsana disappears completely from the world, all the relics will gather together at the Mahācetiya, and travelling from there to Nāgadīpa and the Ratanacetiya, assemble at the Mahābodhi, together with the relics from other parts.  There they will reform the Buddha's golden hued body, emitting the six-coloured aura.  The body will then catch fire and completely disappear, amid the lamentations of the ten thousand world-systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.i.12ff; Dpv.i.45ff; ii.1ff etc.) record that the Buddha visited the Island on three separate occasions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Burmese claim that the Buddha visited their land and went to the Lohitacandana Vihāra, presented by the brothers Mahāpunna and Cūlapunna of Vānijagāma (Ind.  Antiq.xxii., and Sās.36f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first was while he was dwelling at Uruvelā, awaiting the moment for the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, on the full-moon day of Phussa (Dec.-Jan.).  He came to the Mahānāga garden, and stood in the air over an assembly of yakkhas then being held.  He struck terror into their hearts and, at his suggestion, they left Ceylon and went in a body to Giridīpa, hard by.  The Buddha gave a handful of his hair to the deva Mahāsumana of the Sumanakūta mountain, who built a thūpa which was later enlarged into the Mahiyangana Thūpa.  The Buddha again visited Ceylon in the fifth year, on the new-moon day of Citta (March-April), to check an imminent battle between two Nāga chiefs in Nāgadīpa; the combatants were Mahodara and Cūlodara, uncle and nephew, and the object of the quarrel was a gem-set throne.  The Buddha appeared before them, accompanied by the deva Samiddhi-Sumana, carrying a Rājayatana tree from Jetavana, settled their quarrel and received, as a gift, the throne, the cause of the trouble.  He left behind him both the throne and the Rājayatana tree for the worship of the Nāgās and accepted an invitation from the Nāga king, Maniakkhika of Kalyāni, to pay another visit to Ceylon.  Three years later Maniakkhika repeated the invitation and the Buddha came to Kalyāni with five hundred monks, on the second day of Vesākha.  Having preached to the Nāgas, he went to Sumanakūta, on the summit of which mountain he left the imprint of his foot (Legend has it that other footprints were left by the Buddha, on the bank of the river Nammadā, on the Saccabaddha mountain and in Yonakapura).  He then stayed at Dīghavāpī and from there visited Mahāmeghavana, where he consecrated various spots by virtue of his presence, and proceeded to the site of the later Silācetiya.  From there he returned to Jetavana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little information as to the personality of the Buddha is available.  We are told that he was golden-hued (E.g., Sp.iii.689), that his voice had the eight qualities of the Brahmassāra (E.g., D.ii.211; M.ii.166f.  It is said that while an ordinary person spoke one word, Ananda could speak eight; but the Buddha could speak sixteen to the eight of Ananda, MA.i.283) - fluency, intelligibility, sweetness, audibility, continuity, distinctness, depth and resonance - that he had a fascinating personality - he was described by his opponents as seductive (E.g., M.i.269, 275) - that he was handsome, perfect alike in complexion and stature and noble of presence (E.g., M.ii.167).  He had a unique reputation as a teacher and trainer of the human heart.  He was endowed with the thirty-two marks of the Mahāpurisa.  (For details of these, see Buddha).  There is a legend that Mahā Kassapa, though slightly shorter, resembled the Buddha in appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempts made, however, to measure the Buddha always failed; two such attempts are generally mentioned - one by a brahmin of Rājagaha and the other by Rāhu, chief of the Asuras (DA.i.284f).  The Buddha had the physical strength of many millions of elephants (e.g., VibhA.397), but his strength quickly ebbed away after his last meal and he had to stop at twenty-five places while travelling three gāvutas from Pāvā to Kusināra (DA.ii.573).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is often made of the Buddha's love of quiet and peace, and even the heretics respected his wishes in this matter, silencing their discussions at his approach (E.g., D.i.178f; iii.39; even his disciples had a similar reputation, e.g., D.iii.37).  Examples are given of the Buddha refusing to allow noisy monks to live near him.  (E.g., M.i.456; see also M.ii.122, where a monk was jogged by his neighbour because he coughed when the Buddha was speaking).  He loved solitude and often spent long periods away from the haunts of men, allowing only one monk to bring him his meals.  E.g., S.v.12, 320; but this very love of solitude was sometimes brought against him.  By intercourse with whom does he attain to lucidity in wisdom? they asked.  His insight, they said, was ruined by his habit of seclusion (D.iii.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one account (A.i.181), it was his practice to spend part of the day in seclusion, but he was always ready to see anyone who urgently desired his spiritual counsel (E.g., A.iv.438).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahā Govinda Sutta (D.ii.222f ) Sakka is represented as having uttered "eight true praises" of the Buddha.  Perhaps the most predominant characteristics of the Buddha were his boundless love and his eagerness to help all who sought him.  His fondness for children is seen in such stories as those of the two Sopākas, of Kumāra-Kassapa, of Cūla Panthaka and Dabba-Mallaputta and also of the novices Pandita and Sukha.  His kindness to animals appears, for instance, in the introductory story of the Maccha Jātaka and his interference on behalf of Udena's aged elephant, Bhaddavatikā (q.v.).  The Buddha was extremely devoted to his disciples and encouraged them in every way in their difficult life.  The Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā are full of stories indicating that he watched, with great care, the spiritual growth and development of his disciples, understood their problems and was ready with timely interference to help them to win their aims.  Such incidents as those mentioned in the Bhaddāli Sutta (M.i.445), the introduction to the Tittha Jātaka and the Kañcakkhandha Jātaka, seem to indicate that he took a personal and abiding interest in all who came under him.  It was his unvarying custom to greet with a smile all those who visited him, inquiring after their welfare and thus putting them at their ease (Vin.i.313).  When anyone sought permission to question him, he made no conditions as to the topic of discussion.  This is called sabbaññupavārana.  E.g., M.i.230. When the Buddha himself asked a question of any of his interrogators, they could not remain silent, but were bound to answer; a yakkha called Vajirapāni was always present to frighten those who did not wish to do so (e.g., M.i.231).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was not over-anxious to get converts, and when his visitors declared themselves his followers he would urge them to take time to consider the matter - e.g., in the case of Acela Kassapa and Upāligahapati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was staying in a monastery, he paid daily visits to the sick ward to talk to the inmates and to comfort them (See, e.g., Kutāgārasālā).  The charming story of Pūtigata-Tissa shows that he sometimes attended on the sick himself, thus setting an example to his followers.  In return for his devotion, his disciples adored him, but even among those who immediately surrounded him there were a few who refused to obey him implicitly - e.g., Lāludāyī, the companions of Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Chabbaggiyas, the Sattarasavaggiyas and others, not to mention Devadatta and his associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha seems to have shown a special regard for Sāriputta, Ananda and Mahā Kassapa among the monks, and for Anāthapindika, Mallikā, Visakhā, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi among the laity.  He seems to have been secretly amused by the very human qualities of Pasenadi and by his failure to appreciate the real superiority of Mallikā, his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha always declared that he was among the happy ones of this earth, that he was far happier, for instance, than Bimbisāra (E.g., M.i.94), and he remained unmoved by opposition or abuse.  E.g., in the case of the organised conspiracy of Māgandiyā (DhA.iv.1f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapañha (p.134) mentions several illnesses of the Buddha: the injury to his foot has already been referred to; once when the humours of his body were disturbed Jīvaka administered a purge (Vin.i.279); on another occasion he suffered from some stomach trouble which was cured by hot water, or, according to some, by hot gruel (Vin.i.210f.; Thag.185).  The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.232; ThagA.i.311f) mentions another disorder of the humours cured by hot water obtained from the brahmin Devahita, through Upavāna.  The Commentaries mention that he suffered, in his old age, from constant backache, owing to the severe austerities practised by him during the six years preceding his Enlightenment, and the unsuitable meals taken during that period were responsible for a dyspepsia which persisted throughout the rest of his life (SA.i.200), culminating in his last serious illness of dysentery.  MA.i.465; DA.iii.974; see also D.iii.209, when he was preaching to the Mallas of Pāvā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna (Ap.i.299f) contains a set of verses called Pubbakammapiloti; these verses mention certain acts done by the Buddha in the past, which resulted in his having to suffer in various ways in his last birth.  He was once a drunkard named Munāli and he abused the Pacceka Buddha Surabhi.  On another occasion he was a learned brahmin, teacher of five hundred pupils.  One day, seeing the Pacceka Buddha Isigana, he spoke ill of him to his pupils, calling him "sensualist." The result of this act was the calumny against him by Sundarikā in this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another life he reviled a disciple of a Buddha, named Nanda; for this he suffered in hell for twelve thousand years and, in his last life, was disgraced by Ciñcā.  Once, greedy for wealth, he killed his step-brothers, hurling them down a precipice; as a result, Devadatta attempted to kill him by hurling down a rock.  Once, as a boy, while playing on the highway, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and threw a stone at him, and as a result, was shot at by Devadatta's hired archers.  In another life he was a mahout, and seeing a Pacceka Buddha on the road, drove his elephant against him; hence the attack by Nālāgiri.  Once, as a king, he sentenced seventy persons to death, the reward for which he reaped when a splinter pierced his foot.  Because once, as a fisherman's son, he took delight in watching fish being caught, he suffered from a grievous headache when Vidūdabha slaughtered the Sākiyans.  In the time of Phussa Buddha he asked the monks to eat barley instead of rice and, as a result, had to eat barley for three months at Verañja.  (According to the Dhammapada Commentary [iii.257], the Buddha actually had to starve one day at Pañcasālā, because none of the inhabitants were willing to give him alms.) Because he once killed a wrestler, he suffered from cramp in the back.  Once, when a physician, he caused discomfort to a merchant by purging him, hence his last illness of dysentery.  As Jotipāla, he spoke disparagingly of the Enlightenment of Kassapa Buddha, and in consequence had to spend six years following various paths before becoming the Buddha.  He was one of the most short-lived Buddhas, but because of those six years his Sāsana will last longer (Sp.i.190f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha was generally addressed by his own disciples as Bhagavā.  He spoke of himself as Tathāgata, while non-Buddhists referred to him as Gotama or Mahāsamana.  Other names used are Mahāmuni, Sākyamuni, Jina, Sakka (e.g., Sn.vs.345) and Brahma (Sn.vs.91; SnA.ii.418), also Yakkha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.23ff) gives a list of the Buddha's most eminent disciples, both among members of the Order and among the laity.  Each one in the list is mentioned as having possessed pre-eminence in some particular respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who visited the Buddha for discussion or had interviews with him or received instruction and guidance direct from him, the following may be included in addition to those already mentioned (this list does not pretend to be complete;

On this occasion of his coming he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aadittapariyaaya_s,Adittapariyāya Sutta')"&gt;Adittapariyāya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.34f; S.iv.19f; J.i.82; AA.i.57, etc.; PvA.21; Ud.i.9; DhA.i.72).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; managed to win over five hundred of the monks to his side, it was to Gayāsīsa that he retired with them, and there it was that the Buddha's Chief Disciples had to go to reclaim them (Vin.ii.199; DhA.i.121; J.i.142, 425, 490f; iv.180).  It is said (J.i.185, 508; ii.38f) that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt; built a special monastery for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (SA.iii.4; UdA.74) say that the hill was so called because it was composed of a flat stone and was shaped like an elephant's head (gaja-sīsa-sadisa-pitthipāsāno).  There was room on the rock for one thousand monks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hill stands about one mile to the south-west of Gayā and is now called Brahmayoni.  To the south-east of the hill &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; saw the three thūpas of the Tebhātika Jatilā (CAGI.524f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa_s,Gayā Sutta')"&gt;Gayā Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giñjakāvasatha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brick hall at Nādikā (Ñātikā).  The Buddha stayed there on various occasions during his visits to Nādikā.  It was during one of these visits that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambapaalii,Ambapāli')"&gt;Ambapāli&lt;/a&gt; presented her park to the Buddha and the Order (Vin.i.232).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Giñjakāvasatha the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_gosinga_s,Cūlagosinga Sutta')"&gt;Cūlagosinga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.205), the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/janavasabha,Janavasabha Sutta')"&gt;Janavasabha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.200) and several discourses on marana-sati (E.g., A.iii.303f; 306f; 391f; iv.320f); also the sermons to the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sandha,Sandha')"&gt;Sandha&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaccaana,Kaccānagotta')"&gt;Kaccānagotta&lt;/a&gt; (A.v.322f) and the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaccaayana,Kaccāyana')"&gt;Kaccāyana&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.153f; see also S.ii.74; iv.90).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both in the Janavasabha Sutta and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ginjakaavasatha_s,Giñjakāvasatha Sutta')"&gt;Giñjakāvasatha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.356f), which was preached at the same place, the Buddha is represented as having answered questions regarding the destiny and the rebirth of several residents of Nādikā.  Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nādikā were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached to Ananda at Giñjakāvasatha the Dhammā-dāsa (Mirror of Truth) on his last visit to Nādikā, as described in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaparinibbana_s,Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta')"&gt;Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.91ff; see also S.v.357).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.424) state that once the Buddha arrived at Nādikā while travelling in the Vajji country, and the people there built for him a residence entirely made of bricks (giñjakā), hence its name.  Later, residences were also built for the monks, complete with all requirements.  The bricks were evidently a special architectural feature, and this con-firms the belief that buildings were generally of wood.  The "Brick Hall" was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find mention of members of other sects staying there - e.g., the Paribbājaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya,Sabhiya Kaccāna')"&gt;Sabhiya Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.401).  The building was probably a resting place for all travellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girikandaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vihāra in Ceylon restored by Vijayabāhu I (Cv.lx.60).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihāra's gocaragāma was a village called Vattakālaka (q.v.), where lived a girl who, by reason of her great rapture, transplanted herself to the vihāra through the air.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girikandasiva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chieftain, uncle of Pandukābhaya and father of Suvannapāli.  He had been appointed chieftain of the district of Girikanda by Panduvāsudeva, and refused to recognise Pandukābhaya's claim to the throne (Mhv.x.29f).  When Suvannapāli was carried away by Pandu-kābhaya, her father sent his five sons to rescue her, but they were all slain by Canda, son of Pandula (Mhv.x.41f).  When Pandukābhaya became king he restored the province of Girikanda to his uncle, putting him in charge of it (Mhv.x.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Gopāla was also the name of the father of Udena's queen consort, Gopālamātādevī.  AA.i.118.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gopāla&lt;/b&gt;.-One of the Yakkha chieftains, to be invoked by the Buddha's followers in time of need.  D.iii.205.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Gopāla.&lt;/b&gt;-A devaputta of Tāvatimsa.  He was the teacher of Uracchadamālā and gave alms to the Buddha Kassapa and the monks; he heard the Dhamma but could get no special attainment.  Moggallāna met him during a visit to Tāvatimsa and, in answer to the Elder's questions, Gopāla gave an account of himself.  Moggallāna thereupon preached to him and he became a sotāpanna.  Vv.v.14; VvA.270ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Gopāla.&lt;/b&gt;-A devaputta of Tāvatimsa.  He had been a cowherd of Rājagaha and had once offered Moggallāna a meal of kummāsa (junket and rice).  Immediately afterwards he was stung by a snake and died while watching the Elder eat the meal he had given him.  Vv.vii.6; VvA.308f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gilāyana Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he is about to leave the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu to start on a tour, the Buddha is visited by Mahānāma, who asks him how a sick lay-disciple should be admonished.  The Buddha answers that he should be asked to take comfort in his loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and in his possession of the Ariyan virtues.  He should be shown the futility of longing for parents, children and sensual pleasures, and should be persuaded, if possible, to aspire not after rebirth, but after emancipation.  S.v.408f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gadrabhapañha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems set by King Vedeha to Mahosadha, in order to test him, at the instigation of the king's ministers.  The king sent word to Mahosadha that while he was on his way to see him his horse had broken its leg; would Mahosadha therefore, send him a more excellent horse? Mahosadha, understanding the significance of the message, went to the palace, sending his father on before him.  When Mahosadha entered he found his father seated, but, as had been prearranged, he obliged his father to get up and offer him his seat.  On this there was a great uproar, all saying that he had slighted his father.  But Mahosadha convinced the king that he was a more excellent man than his father, giving proof of this by producing before the king an ass which he had brought with him, and making the king acknowledge that a colt born of the ass through a Sindh mare would be far more valuable than the colt's sire (J.vi.342f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also given as a separate Jātaka (No.111).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garahita Jātaka (No.219)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was a monkey in the Himalayas and, having been captured by a forester, was given to the king.  The king grew fond of him, and the monkey learnt the ways of men.  The king set him free, and when his fellows saw him they insisted on hearing from him how men lived.  He told them of men's greed for possessions, and how in each house there were two masters, one of them beardless, with long breasts and plaited hair.  The monkeys, hearing of this folly, stopped their ears and went elsewhere, saying they could not bear to live in a place where they had heard such unseemly things! That place came thereafter to be called the Garahitapitthi-pāsāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a discontented monk.  J.ii.184.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gundāvana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forest in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhuraa,Madhurā')"&gt;Madhurā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā Kaccāna')"&gt;Mahā Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; stayed there and was visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avantiputta,Avantiputta')"&gt;Avantiputta&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhuraa,Madhurā')"&gt;Madhurā&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhura_s,Madhurā Sutta')"&gt;Madhurā Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.83f), and by the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kandaraayana,Kandarāyana')"&gt;Kandarāyana&lt;/a&gt; (A.i.67f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full name of the forest seems to have been Kanhagundāvana (MA.ii.738; J.R.A.S., 1894, 349).  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gumbiya Jātaka (No.366)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was a merchant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and led a caravan of five hundred carts through the forest.  He warned his men that they should not eat anything found in the forest without first consulting him.  On the way they came across leaves strewn in the forest, covered with honeycomb.  These had been placed there by a yakkha, named Gumbiya, who had put poison in the honey.  Some of the men ate the honey, while others remembered the warning of the Bodhisatta as soon as they had tasted it.  Those who ate died, the others were given emetics and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk who, fascinated by a woman's charm, wished to become a layman.  Sensuous pleasures are like honey sprinkled with deadly poison, said the Buddha.  The monk became a sotāpanna.  J.iii.200f.; cp.  Kimpakka Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

On another occasion, when the Buddha was staying there with many eminent monks, among whom were Sāriputta, Moggallāna and others, their conversation led to the preaching of the Mahāgosinga Sutta (q.v.) (M.i.212f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gosingasālavanadāya.&lt;/b&gt;-A forest tract near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;.  When the Buddha was living in the Kūtāgārasāla, in the Mahavana, he was visited by many people and there was great disturbance.  In order to find quiet and solitude, certain monks, among whom were Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata and Katissaha, retired into this forest (A.v.133).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giridipā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An island near Ceylon.  When the Buddha visited Ceylon he drew Giridipā up to Ceylon, told the yakkhas to go on to it, and then restored it to its former place (Mhv.i.30; Dpv.i.67f).  Geiger (Mhv.Trs., p.4, n.4) thinks that the reference is not to an island, but to the highlands (giri) in the interior of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gajabhuja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gajabhuja.-An officer of Mānābharana (2).  He was defeated by Māyāgeha at Samīrakkha (Cv.lxxii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gajabhuja.-A chieftain of Gova.  He was slain by Konappu, afterwards Vimaladhammasūriya (Cv.xciv.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gajabhuja.-See Gajabāhu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangātīriya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was a householder named Datta of Sāvatthi.  On discovering that he had, though unwittingly, committed incest with both his mother and sister, he was overcome with anguish and left the world.  He adopted a course of austerity, dwelling in a hut of palm leaves on the bank of the Ganges, hence his name.  For a whole year he kept silence; in the second year he spoke but once to a woman who, in filling his bowl, spilt the milk, wishing to discover if he were dumb.  In the third year he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a householder, and supplied drinks to monks (Thag.v.127-8; ThagA.i.248f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.195f.; Thig.224f) that after Gangātiriya's conception his mother was driven out of her house in the absence of her husband, her mother-in-law suspecting her of infidelity.  The child was born in a travellers' rest-house in Rājagaha, whither she had gone in search of her husband, and was taken away by a caravan leader who happened to see it when its mother was away bathing.  Later the woman was carried away by a robber chief, by whom she had a daughter.  One day, in a quarrel with her husband, she threw her daughter on the bed, wounding her on the head, and fearing her husband's wrath she fled to Rājagaha, where she became a courtesan and later mistress of Gangātiriya, who was unaware of his relationship to her.  Some time afterwards he took to wife the robber's daughter as well.  One day, while looking at the young wife's head, the older one saw the wound, and as a result of her questions learnt the truth.  Filled with dismay, both mother and daughter became nuns, and Gangātiriya left the world as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gangātiriya is perhaps to be identified with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna.  (Ap.ii.437; but the verses are also ascribed to Mahāgavaccha, ThagA.i.57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gona (Gonaka)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river to the south of Anurādhapura.  On its banks, King Cūlabhaya built the Cūlagallaka-Vihāra (Mhv.xxxv.13), and Vankanāsika-Tissa, the Mahāmangala-Vihāra (Mhv.v.113).  Once, when Dhātusena was fleeing from his enemies with a thera, his uncle, the river was found to be in flood, but a nāga king took them across (Cv.xxxviii.24).  Later, when building the Kālavāpi, Dhātusena dammed up the river.  Cv.v.42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is identified with the modern Kalā-oya (Cv.  Trs.i.30, n.3).3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gahapati Vagga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gahapati Vagga.-The sixth section of the Majjhima Nikāya.  M.i.339-413.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gahapati Vagga.-The third section of the Atthaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya.  It contains ten suttas, including the Buddha's praises of Ugga of Vesāli, Ugga of Hatthigāma, and Hatthaka Ālavaka.  A.iv.208-35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gahapati Vagga.-The fifth chapter of the Nidāna Samyutta.  S.ii.68-80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Gahapati Vagga.-The thirteenth chapter of the Salāyatana Samyutta.  It contains conversations between various eminent householders on the one side, and the Buddha and the monks on the other.  S.iv.109-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gāmendavālamahā-vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Rohana.  It was the residence of Cūlapindapātikatissa and of Milakkhatissa (AA.i.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was evidently within easy reach of Cittalapabbata and Kājaragāma (AA.i.22).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Maliyadeva Thera recited the Cha Chakka Sutta at this vihāra, and at the end of the recital sixty monks became arahants.  MA.ii.1024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gahvaratīriya (Gavharatīriya) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi, named Aggidatta.  Having seen Yamakapātihāriya, he entered the Order and lived in a spot called Gahvaratīra - hence his name - and there in due course became an arahant.  On his return to Sāvatthi, his relations held a great almsgiving in his honour and requested him to live near them.  But be refused this request and returned to the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a hunter in the time of Sikhī Buddha, and was delighted by the sound of the Buddha's voice as he preached (Thag.v.31; ThagA.i.91).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ghosasaññaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.451), but the same verses are also attributed to Dhammika.  ThagA.i.398.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gonaraviya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk of Ceylon, probably a colleague of Mahāsīva.  It is said that Mahāsīva was explaining to him the Mahā Saccaka Sutta, and that when he came to the passage where the Buddha charges Saccaka with not understanding the training of the body, much less that of the mind, Gonaraviya laid aside his fan and walked away, saying that the Buddha could not have said such a thing; but Mahāsīva persuaded him that it was so.  v.l.  Moranāla.  MA.i.463.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guhasīva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Kālinga.  At first he did not pay honour to the Tooth-relic of the Buddha which was in his capital, but later, having seen a miracle, he became a Buddhist and paid the relic all homage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, he sent the relic to Ceylon, through his daughter Hemamālā and her husband Dantakumāra.  The whole story is given in the Dāthāvamsa (chap.iv.ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gihi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion, when Anāthapindika comes to see the Buddha, the Buddha tells Sāriputta of the four kinds of clear consciousness (ābhicetasikadhamma) which come to the pious lay devotee who guards the five precepts - viz., unwavering faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and the possession of Ariyan virtues.  To him comes also the confidence that he is free from birth in a Niraya, among beasts or petas or in unhappy states, and that he is a sotāpanna.  A.iii.211f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangāpeyyāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifth book of the Samyutta Nikāya a repetition under the name of Gangāpeyyāla occurs several times.  "Just as the Gangā flows to the east, slides to the east, and tends to the east, even so, a monk who cultivates the bojjhangas (S.v.135, 137), the satipatthānas (196), the indriyas (239, 241), the padhānas (244), the balas 249, 251), the iddhi-pādas (290), and the jhānas (307), slides and tends towards nibbāna."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gothayimbara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Dutthagāmani's chief warriors.  He was the son of Mahānāga of Nitthulavitthika and owed his name to his dwarfish stature.  He pulled up imbara-trees from a forest clearing, thus demonstrating his enormous strength.  Kākavannatissa, hearing of this, sent for him to the court (Mhv.xxiii.49ff; the Rasavāhini ii.28, says he subdued a yakkha named Jayasena).  He took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura, using a coconut-palm as weapon (Mhv.xxv.27, 32, 44f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MT.452) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave daily milk rice to the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Ras.ii.87f, which says that he was so called because he was short, but that according to the Uttara-vihāra monks he was given the name because, when he went hunting, he killed animals by dashing them on kotthayimbara-trees.  Once when he was holding a feast in his house, after defeating the Damilas, a Yakkha, named Jayasena of Aritthapabbata, happened to pass by, and, entering the house, fell in love with G.'s wife.  G.  challenged him to a fight and defeated him.  He celebrated the victory for seven days and went to the palace drunk.  Being refused admission, he swam across to Kāvīrapattana, and, having gone as far as the Himālaya in search of holy monks, was about to kill himself in despair when an arahant Thera appeared before him and ordained him.  He later attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Among the assembled multitude was a villager, who felt that he would die unless he could obtain a morsel of Gandha's rice.  When this was told to Gandha he suggested that the man should work for him for three years, taking in payment a bowl of his rice.  The villager agreed and henceforth became known as Bhattabhatika.  At the end of the three years Gandha kept his promise and gave orders that Bhattabhatika should enjoy all his master's own splendours for one day, and asked all the members of his household, except his wife Cintāmanī, to wait on him.  When Bhattabhatika sat down to eat, a Pacceka Buddha appeared before him; Bhattabhatika gave his food to the Pacceka Buddha who, in sight of all those that had gathered to watch Bhattabhatika's splendour, went through the air to Gandhamādana.  When Gandha heard of what bad happened, he gave one-half of all his possessions to Bhattabhatika in return for a share of the merit he had gained.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gharanī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman, lay-disciple of the Buddha.  She had attained the Third Fruit of the Path and when the Buddha was about to perform the Twin Miracle, she offered to perform a miracle herself - to transform the earth into water and dive about in it like a water-bird.  DhA.iii.209. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Gharanī Stūpa near Suppāraka (Divy.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gūtha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the purgatories.  It is next to the Mahā Niraya, and is the habitation of needle-mouthed creatures who rip away the skin, flesh, tendons, etc., of the victim and then devour his marrow (M.iii.185; J.vi.8; SNA.ii.481).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who insult their parents are born in this purgatory.  DhA.iv.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guttila&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as a musician in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He was unmarried and supported his blind parents.  He had as pupil Mūsila from Ujjeni, and to him Guttila taught all he knew.  Later, Guttila introduced Mūsila at the king's court where, as soon as he had the ear of the king, he arranged for a competition with his master, that the king might decide who should be the court musician.  Guttila, fearing a contest in his old age, fled into the forest where Sakka appeared before him and promised to help him to victory.  The contest was held, and when Guttila played according to Sakka's instructions, the sound of his music filled the city and heavenly nymphs descended to earth to dance.  Mūsila was defeated and stoned to death by the enraged crowd.  Later, Sakka sent Mātali to fetch Guttila to Tāvatimsa in his chariot, and as a return for his music Guttila was allowed to discover to what good deeds the inhabitants of Tāvatimsa owed their birth there.  On returning to earth after seven days, he told the people what he had seen and exhorted them to do good (J.ii.248ff; VvA.137ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once Guttila sent a thousand to a woman, wishing to win her favour, but she would not grant it.  He decked himself, and in the evening sang and played his lute outside her house.  She was so enthralled by his music that she opened her window and, thinking it was a door, walked out and was killed by the fall (AA.i.16f; is this perhaps a different person?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guttila is mentioned (Mil.115, 291) as one of the four human beings who went to Tāvatimsa even in their human body, the others being Sādhīna, Nimi and Mandhātā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girigāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon.  A young novice named Tissa of Pañcaggalalena, travelling through the air, saw the daughter of the smith of Girigāma bathing in a lotus pond with five of her friends, and heard them singing aloud.  He was so fascinated by her that he lost his power of flight.  SNA.i.70; ApA.i.128.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghatīkāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ghatīkāra Sutta.-Preached during a tour in Kosala.  The Buddha turned off the main road and, when be came to the spot which had once been Vehalinga, he smiled.  Being asked by Ananda the reason for his smile, the Buddha related to him and to the monks the story of Ghatīkāra, the potter of Vehalinga, as given above (M.ii.45ff).  It is said (MA.ii.717) that the Buddha wished to make known to the monks the great piety of Ghatīkāra.  The sutta was repeated at a shrine near Todeyya, which was being worshipped by the people without their knowing its significance.  The Buddha related the sutta and explained that the shrine was the thūpa of Kassapa Buddha.  DhA.iii.251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ghatīkāra Sutta.-Relates the visit of Ghatīkāra Mahā Brahmā to the Buddha at Jetavana and the ensuing conversation.  S.i.35f, 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gavesī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follower of Kassapa Buddha.  Five hundred others were associated with him, and at first their spiritual life was poor.  Gavesī, realising this, put forth effort and, step by step, attained greater proficiency until, at last, he became an arahant.  His followers imitated him in every step of his spiritual advancement, and they, too, became arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related this story to Ananda during a tour in Kosala.  They came to a sāla-grove and there the Buddha smiled; when asked the reason for his smile, he replied that the grove was the scene of Gavesī's practice of the religious life.  A.iii.214ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golakāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Husband of Dīghatālā.  He obtained his wife after having worked seven years in a house.  One day, when on his way with his wife to visit her parents, they came to a stream, and, while they were hesitating before crossing, a man named Dīghapitthi came along and offered to take them across, because, he said, he was well known to the denizens of the river.  He took Dīghatālā first, with the sweetmeats intended for her relations, and persuaded her to come with him, leaving her husband.  When Golakāla realised what had happened, he jumped into the stream in desperation, easily crossing it - because it was really very shallow - and claimed his wife.  In the course of the quarrel between the two men they came to where Mahosadha held court, and be, having heard their respective stories, decided, with the approval of the assembled populace, in favour of Golakāla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said Golakāla was so called because he was dwarfish, like a ball (gola), and black (kāla).  J.vi.337, 338.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gijjhakūta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five hills encircling &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  It was evidently a favourite resort of those who followed the religious life.  (It was so even in times gone by, see, e.g., J.ii.55).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been attracted by its solitude, and is mentioned as having visited it on several occasions, sometimes even in the dark, in drizzling rain, while &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt; made unsuccessful attempts to frighten him (S.i.109).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on the slopes of Gijjhakūta, where the Buddha was wandering about, that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; hurled at him a mighty stone to kill him, but only a splinter injured his foot (Vin.ii.193, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there also that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka,Jīvaka Komāra-bhacca')"&gt;Jīvaka Komāra-bhacca&lt;/a&gt; administered a purgative to the Buddha (AA.i.216).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who visited the Buddha on Gijjhakūta are mentioned: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati,Sahampati')"&gt;Sahampati&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.153), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the youth &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha,Māgha')"&gt;Māgha&lt;/a&gt; (Sn., p.86), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda,Inda')"&gt;Inda&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.206), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.233; iv.102), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Paribbājaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s2_sal,Sajjha')"&gt;Sajjha&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.371), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapagotta,Kassapagotta')"&gt;Kassapagotta&lt;/a&gt; monk (A.i.237), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancasikha,Pañcasikha')"&gt;Pañcasikha&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.103; D.ii.220), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutavaa,Sutavā')"&gt;Sutavā&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.369), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the four kings of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājika')"&gt;Cātummahārājika&lt;/a&gt; world and their followers (D.iii.195), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhayaraajakumaara_s,Abhayarājakumāra')"&gt;Abhayarājakumāra&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.126), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka Mandikāputta')"&gt;Upaka Mandikāputta&lt;/a&gt; (A.ii.181), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammika,Dhammika')"&gt;Dhammika&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.368), and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara,Vassakāra')"&gt;Vassakāra&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.18; D.ii.72).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several well-known suttas were preached on Gijjhakūta - e.g., the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha,Māgha')"&gt;Māgha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammika_v_s,Dhammika')"&gt;Dhammika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chalabhijaatiya_s,Chalabhijāti')"&gt;Chalabhijāti&lt;/a&gt; Suttas, the discourse on the seven &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aparihaaniya_s,Aparihānīyadhammā')"&gt;Aparihānīyadhammā&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.21f.), the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasaropama_s,Mahāsāropama')"&gt;Mahāsāropama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s,Ātānātiya')"&gt;Ātānātiya&lt;/a&gt; Suttas.  (See also S.ii.155, 185, 190, 241; iii.121; A.ii.73; iii.21; iv.160).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (AA.i.412) that in due course a vihāra was erected on Gijjhakūta for the Buddha and his monks; here cells were erected for the use of monks who came from afar, but these cells were so difficult of access that monks arriving late at Rājagaha would ask &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th,Dabbamallaputta-Tissa')"&gt;Dabbamallaputta-Tissa&lt;/a&gt; to find accommodation for them in Gijjhakūta, in order to test his capabilities (Vin.ii.76; DhA.iii.321f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of several eminent monks who stayed at Gijjhakūta from time to time - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.263; A.iii.300; S.ii.155), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.383), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna,Punna Mantāniputta')"&gt;Punna Mantāniputta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali,Upāli')"&gt;Upāli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.155),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda,Cunda')"&gt;Cunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt; (S.iv.55).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa fell ill there, and ultimately committed suicide.  (Another monk is mentioned as having thrown himself down from Gijjhakūta because he was discontented with his life, Vin.iii.82. According to one account, AA.i.146f, Vakkali, too, committed suicide by throwing himself from Gijjhakūta; but see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vakkali,Vakkali')"&gt;Vakkali&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana,Lakkhana')"&gt;Lakkhana&lt;/a&gt; are reported to have stayed there, and to have seen many inhabitants of Rājagaha reborn in Gijjhakūta as petas (S.ii.254; Vin.iii.104; for Moggallāna see also A.iv.75).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mettiyabhummajaka,Mettiya-bhummajakas')"&gt;Mettiya-bhummajakas&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iii.167) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa,Chabbaggiyas')"&gt;Chabbaggiyas&lt;/a&gt; (ibid., 82) were also in the habit of visiting the hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several places are mentioned as having been visited by the Buddha during his sojourns on Gijjhakūta, and it may be inferred from accounts given of these visits that these places were within easy reach of the hill.  Such, for example, are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Patibhānakūta (S.v.448), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sitavana,Sītavana')"&gt;Sītavana&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha went to visit &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sona,Sona')"&gt;Sona&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.374), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sappini,Sappinī')"&gt;Sappinī&lt;/a&gt;, on the banks of which lived various &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka,Paribbājakas')"&gt;Paribbājakas&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabha,Sarabha')"&gt;Sarabha&lt;/a&gt; (A.i.185; ii.29, 176), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Paribbājakārama of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarikaa,Udumbarikā')"&gt;Udumbarikā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodha,Nigrodha')"&gt;Nigrodha&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moranivapa,Moranivāpa')"&gt;Moranivāpa&lt;/a&gt; on the bank of the lake &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumaagadhaa,Sumāgadhā')"&gt;Sumāgadhā&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.39), and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the park &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maddakucci,Maddakucchi')"&gt;Maddakucchi&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha was removed after the injury to his foot (DhA.ii.164).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suukarakhatalena,Sūkara-khatalena')"&gt;Sūkara-khatalena&lt;/a&gt; was on the slope of Gijjhakūta, and there the Buddha was once visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighanakha,Dīghanakha')"&gt;Dīghanakha&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.233; M.i.497).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka,Jīvaka')"&gt;Jīvaka's&lt;/a&gt; mango-grove lay between Gijjhakūta and the walls of Rājagaha (DA.i.150).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gijjhakūta was so called, either because its peak was like a vulture's beak, or because it was the resort of many vultures (SNA.ii.417; AA.i.412; MA.i.291, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham (CAGI.534), on the authority of both Fa Hien and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt;, identifies Gijjhakūta with the modern Sailagiri, about two and a half miles to the north-east of the old town.  It is also called Giriyek Hill.  Gijjhakūta is sometimes referred to as Gijjhapabbata (J.ii.50; iii.255, 484) and as Gijjha.  J.vi.204, 212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ganaka-Moggallāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin teacher of Sāvatthi.  He visited the Buddha at the Pubbārāma, and the Buddha preached to him the Ganaka-Moggallāna Sutta, after which, it is said, he became the Buddha's follower (M.iii.1ff).  His name and his teaching seem to indicate that he was a mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

They appealed to a tortoise who was there for a decision; he said they were both beautiful, but he himself was more beautiful than either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to two monks who bragged of their good looks and quarrelled about them.  They appealed to an older monk, who gave the same answer as the tortoise of the story.  J.ii.151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gayā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gayā.-&lt;/b&gt; A pond in which people bathed, that their sins might be washed away (J.v.388f).  Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.145) it was a circular pond in which was a bathing ghat (mandavāpisanthānam tittham).  But see below, Gayā (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gayā.&lt;/b&gt;-A town in India.  It lay on the road between the Bodhi-tree and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and was three gāvutas from the Bodhi-tree and fifteen yojanas from Benares.  (MA.i.387f; Fa Hien says the distance from the Bodhi-tree to Gayā, was twenty li, or about 3 1/3 miles).  It was between the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhimanda,Bodhimanda')"&gt;Bodhimanda&lt;/a&gt; and Gayā that the Buddha, on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;, met &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.8).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha stayed at Gayā on several occasions: once at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaasiisa,Gayāsīsa')"&gt;Gayāsīsa&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.34; S.iv.19; A.iv.302), and also near the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tankitamanca,Tankitamañca')"&gt;Tankitamañca&lt;/a&gt; (Sn.  p.47; S.i.207, etc.), the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suciloma,Suciloma')"&gt;Suciloma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says that Gayā was the name given both to the village and a bathing ghat near to it (also called Gayāpokkharanī).  Dhamma-pāla (UdA.74, 75; cp.  SNA.i.301), on the other hand, speaks of a Gayānadī and a Gayāpokkharanī as being two distinct bathing ghats, both commonly called Gayātittha, and both considered to possess the power of washing away sins.  People went there, offered sacrifices to the gods, recited the Vedas, and immersed themselves in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (ThagA.i.388f, 418; Thag.v.287) it is stated that every year, in the earlier half of the month of Phagguna (March), people held a bathing festival at the bathing ghat at Gayā, the festival being called Gayāphaggunī.  It was at one of these festivals that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/senaka,Senaka Thera')"&gt;Senaka Thera&lt;/a&gt; was converted by the Buddha.  This explanation of Gayāphaggu is, perhaps, not quite correct, for, according to some, the river (Nerañjarā) which ran by Gayā was itself called Phaggu (Skt.  Phaggu).  E.g., Cunningham: AGI.524; Böthlinck and Roth's Dict.  s.v.  Phalgu; Neumann (Majh.  N.  Trans.i.271) says that the village of Gayā itself was called Phaggu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town of Gayā is often called Brahmagayā to distinguish it from Buddhagayā (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guttā &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Guttā Therī.&lt;/b&gt;-She belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi; when she reached adolescence household life became repugnant to her owing to her upanissaya, and, with her parents' consent, she entered the Order under Pajāpatī Gotamī.  For a long time she could not concentrate her mind, but, encouraged by the Buddha, she attained arahantship.  Thig.vv.163-8; ThigA.157f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Guttā&lt;/b&gt;.-The third of the seven daughters of Kiki, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  She was a previous birth of Patācārā.  J.vi.481; but see Ap.ii.558, v.15, where Patācārā is identified with Bhikkhunī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghotamukha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, probably of Pātaliputta.  On coming to visit &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, he saw Udena there in Khemiyambavana and had a conversation with him, recorded in the Ghotamukha Sutta.  At the conclusion of the talk he declared himself converted and wished to offer to Udena the daily allowance of five hundred kahāpanas which he regularly received from the king of Anga.  Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall for the Order at Pātaliputta.  The suggestion was agreed to and the assembly-hall, when built, was called Ghotamukhī (M.ii.157ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.786f) adds that Ghotamukha held the view that one should seek self-glorification, even by the slaughter of one's parents, and that he was the only person born in heaven, in spite of having held that view.  After his birth in heaven, having discovered the cause of his good fortune, be came to earth in disguise and, after revealing his identity to his only remaining sister, told her where his treasures were hidden and instructed her to spend some of the money on renovating an old refectory which the monks were trying to restore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gārava Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Buddha sat under the Ajapāla Banyan tree, soon after the Enlightenment (in the fifth week, says the Commentary, S.A i.158), a thought came to him that he should have someone whom he could consider and honour as his teacher.  But, seeing no one worthy of such honour and respect, he decided that the Dhamma should be his teacher.  Thereupon Sahampati appeared before him and reminded him that in this decision he was acting as all Buddhas acted.  S.i.138f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="Govinda"&gt;Govinda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steward or treasurer of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/disampati,Disampati')"&gt;Disampati&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;p&gt;He had a son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotipaala,Jotipāla')"&gt;Jotipāla&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded him after his death and came to be known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_govinda,Mahā Govinda')"&gt;Mahā Govinda&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.230f; Mtu.iii.204).  &lt;p&gt;"Govinda" was evidently a title and not a name.  &lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/g2_u,Govindiya')"&gt;Govindiya&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gokanna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gokanna.-A locality in Ceylon and a vihāra founded by Mahāsena, on the site of a Hindu temple (Mhv.xxxvii.41).  According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.685), it was on the east coast of Ceylon.  Elsewhere (p.269), the Tīkā speaks of a Gokannatittha in the neighbourhood of the estuary of the Mahākandara-nadī, and the Cūlavamsa (lxxi.18) mentions Gokanna as the last of a series of fords in Rohana, important from a strategic point of view, along the Mahā-vālkaugangā, from "Sarogāmatittha to Gokanna." In another passage (Cv.xli.79), Gokanna(ka) is spoken of as mahannava (the ocean).  These facts support Geiger's conjecture (Cv.  Trs.i.59, 4; n.316, n.2) that Gokanna refers to the Trincomalee (Koddiyar) Bay at the estuary of the Mahāvālukagangā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gokanna(ka) is twice described as the scene of magic rites, once in the case of Mahānāga (Cv.xli.79) and again in that of Mānavamma (Cv.lvii.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggabodhi V.  built a padhānaghara for the Gokanna-vihāra.  Cv.xlviii.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gokanna.-A general of Gajabāhu who defeated Kittisirimegha; he had his headquarters in Kālavāpi, of which place he was Nagaragiri.  At a meeting between him and Parakkamabāhu at Buddhagāma, the latter won him over to his side.  An amusing story is told of a dream he had after his promise of help to Parakkamabāhu (Cv.lxvi.47ff).  He fled, therefore, to Kālavāpi and, on various occasions, offered battle to the forces of Parakkamabāhu, but everywhere he was defeated, the worst reverse being at Nīlagala by the general Māyāgeha.  After that he built a fortification in Kālavāpi, where he lived in comparative quiet.  The last we hear of him is of his incitement of Mānābharana to seize the throne (Cv.lxiii.34; lxvi.35ff, 62; lxx.68, 71, 83, 257).  Geiger thinks (Cv.  Trs i.255, n.3) that Gokanna is probably a clan name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gokanna.-A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  mentioned among leaders of the expedition which he sent to South India.  Cv.lxxvi.253, 270, 324-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garahadinna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resident of Sāvatthi and friend of Sirigutta.  The latter was a follower of the Buddha, and the former of the Niganthas.  Instigated by the Niganthas, Garahadinna constantly blamed his friend for his allegiance to the Buddha, until one day, in exasperation, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house in order to prove that their claim to omniscience was false.  To this end he had a ditch dug and filled with filth, ropes stretched longitudinally over the ditch, and the seats so arranged that the moment the Niganthas sat down they would be tipped over and flung into the ditch.  The Niganthas arrived, and everything happened as Sirigutta had arranged.  Garahadinna, filled with desire for revenge, hid his resentment and invited the Buddha and his disciples with the intention of humiliating them.  He employed the same stratagem as his friend, except that the ditch was filled with glowing coals instead of with filth.  The Buddha came, knowing all that had happened, and by an exercise of iddhi-power caused large lotus flowers to spring up from the bed of coals.  Sitting thereon, he created an abundant supply of food and preached the Dhamma.  Garahadinna, Sirigutta, and many others became sotāpannas (DhA.i.434f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this occasion was also preached the Khadirangāra Jātaka.  (But see the introductory Story of the Jātaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mil.350) that when the Buddha preached at Garahadinna's house, eighty-four thousand beings realised the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godhika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of a Malla chief in Pāvā.  He went to Kapilavatthu with his friends, Subāhu, Valliya and Uttiya, and there he saw the Twin Miracle and joined the Order, later attaining arahantship.  (But see below.) At Rājagaha, Bimbisāra built a hut for him but forgot the roof.  The gods prevented rain from falling till this error was rectified.  Godhika and his friends had been companions in good deeds in the past, especially in the time of Siddhattha Buddha and of Kassapa Buddha.  Eighty-seven kappas ago Godhika was seven times king, under the name of Mahāsena (Thag.vs.51; ThagA.i.123f; Ap.i.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta (S.i.120f; SA.i.144f; also DhA.i.431f ) account, Godhika lived on the Kālasilā in Isigilipassa.  There he made various vain attempts to win arahantship (the DhA.i.431f adds that he suffered from a disease brought about by hard work), achieving only temporary emancipation of mind, from which he then fell away.  Six times this happened and then he decided to commit suicide by cutting his throat.  Māra saw this and reported it to the Buddha, but when the Buddha arrived it was too late and Godhika lay "supine on his couch with his shoulders twisted around." The Buddha, however, declared that Godhika had attained Nibbāna.  The Commentary states that, after cutting his throat, Godhika so checked his final agony that he won arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Gandhāra- or Gandhārī-vijjā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charm whereby one could become invisible and multiform, pass through all obstacles, through earth and water, and touch the sun and moon (D.i.213).  Elsewhere (J.iv.498) the charm is mentioned as being only useful for the purpose of making oneself invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā Commentary (I.51f) distinguishes a Lesser and a Greater.  Pilinda-vaccha knew the former and thought that the Buddha would teach him the other.  The charm enabled him to travel through the air and read the thoughts of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (DA ii.389) explains that the charm was so called, either because it was invented by a sage named Gandhāra, or because it originated in Gandhāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gandhāra.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha mentioned in a nominal list.  M.iii.69; ApA.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gandhāra.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the sixteen&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"&gt;Mahājanapadas&lt;/a&gt; (countries) (A.i.213; iv.252, etc.; in the Niddesa and Mahāvastu lists Gandhāra is omitted and others substituted).  Its capital was Takkasilā, famous for its university; its king in the time of the Buddha was Pukkusāti.  There was friendly intercourse between him and Bimbisāra of Magadha.  Merchants and visitors from one country to another were lodged and fed at the expense of the country's king, and no tariffs were levied on their merchandise.  There was constant exchange of goods and valuables, and on one occasion Bimbisāra, wishing to send his friend a gift of particular value, despatched to him a letter containing news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  When Pukkusāti read the letter he decided to become a follower of the Buddha, and ordained himself as a monk; then, leaving his kingdom, he travelled all the way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha (MA.ii.979ff).  This conversion of Gandhāra's' king, however, does not seem to have had the effect of converting the rest of its people to the Buddha's faith.  The memory of Pukkusāti was evidently soon forgotten, for we find Moggaliputta Tissa, at the conclusion of the Third Council, sending the Thera Majjhantika to convert Gandhāra (Mhv.xii.3ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa's account, Pukkusāti's kingdom was over one hundred leagues in extent (MA.ii.988), and the distance from Takkasilā to Sāvatthi was one hundred and ninety-two leagues (MA.ii.987; from Benares it was one hundred and twenty leagues, vīsamyo-janasata; J.i.395; ii.47).  There was evidently a well-known caravan route linking the two countries, although Gandhāra was regarded as a paccantima janapada.  (MA.ii.982; there was also constant trade between Gandhāra and Videha, J.iii.365ff.  It would appear from the Mahā Niddesa i.154 that Takkasilā was a regular centre of trade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Majjhantika's visit, the people of Gandhāra were being harassed by the Nāga-king Aravāla, and the chronicles contain details of his conversion by the monk.  The Nāga-king, together with his retinue, the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, became devout followers of the Buddha.  Majjhantika preached the Āsīvisūpama Sutta, and many thousands joined the Order.  (Mhv.xii.9ff; Smp.i.64f; Dpv.viii.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gandhāra appears to have included Kasmīra, the two countries being always mentioned together as Kasmīra-Gandhāra.  They occupied the sites of the modern districts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi in the northern Punjab (PHAI.  p.93).  In the time of Asoka the country formed part of his empire, and is mentioned as such in Rock Edict V.  Before that it was subject to the Achaemenid kings.  Gandhāra was always famous for its red woollen shawls (kambala) (SNA.ii.487; J.vi.501).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another king of Takkasilā besides Pukkusāti is mentioned - namely, Naggaji, who was a contemporary of Nimi, king of Videha.  (J.iii.377; cf.  Ait.  Brāhmana vii.34; Sat.  Brāhmana viii.1, 4, 10; see also Gandhārarājā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eye teeth of the Buddha was deposited in Gandhāra (Bu.xxviii.6; D.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guttila Jātaka (No.243)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Guttila (q.v.) and his contest with Mūsila.  Mūsila is identified with Devadatta, Sakka with Anuruddha, and the king with Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta.  The monks had tried to persuade him to acknowledge the Buddha as his teacher, because it was from him that he had learned the three Pitakas and the four Jhānas.  But Devadatta would not consent.  J.ii.248ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gagga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gagga.-A monk.  He became insane, and in this condition did many things unworthy of a monk.  When his colleagues blamed him, the Buddha interceded on his behalf and suggested that he be given absolution for his offences, in view of his insanity.  The monks acted according to the Buddha's advice.  Vin.i.123; ii.80f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gagga.-A brahmin, father of Angulimāla (M.ii.102).  Gagga, whose wife was Mantānī, was chaplain to the king of Kosala (MA.ii.743).  Gagga may have been a gotta-name.  Thus when, after his ordination, Angulimāla is introduced to Pasenadi, the latter addresses him as Gagga Mantāniputta.  M.ii.102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gagga.-A brahmin, father of the Bodhisatta in the Gagga Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gatasaññaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gatasaññaka Thera.-An arahant.  In the time of Tissa Buddha he joined the Order at the age of seven, and threw up into the air seven nangaliki-flowers as offering to the Buddha.  Eight kappas ago he became king, three times, under the name of Aggisikha.  Ap.i.127.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gatasaññaka Thera.-An arahant.  He saw the Buddha Siddhattha going through the air, though only his robe was visible to him.  The sight filled him with joy and he concentrated his mind thereon.  Ap.i.253f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghatamandadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety-four kappas ago he saw the Pacceka Buddha, Sucintita, afflicted with a nervous disease and gave him ghee (ghatamanda).  He became king of the gods fifty-four times and king of men fifty-one times (Ap.ii.383f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verses are repeated elsewhere (Ap.ii.436), and are ascribed in the Theragāthā Commentary to Ajina Thera.  ThagA.i.250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gokulikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary division of the Vajjiputtakā, their immediate parent-body being the Mahāsanghikas.  Later, from the Gokulikas, sprang two other schools - the Paññattivādins and the Bāhulikas (or Bahussutikas) (Dpv.v.40; Mhv.v.4f.; Mbv., p.96).  Their most important heresy seems to have been that they considered all sankhāras, without qualification, no better than a heap of embers (kukkula) whence the flames have died out as from an inferno of ashes.  They based this view on the Buddha's declaration made in the Adittapariyāya Sutta ("All is on fire, bhikkhus") (Kvu.ii.7, p.208, and Points of Controversy, 127f).  This view was probably responsible for their other name of (Kukkulikas or Kukkutikas) (Rockhill, 186ff).  It may be that Kukkulika was their earlier name, of which Gokulikā was either a corruption or a derivation from the name of one of their teachers.  But all Pāli records give only the "Gokulika" reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gonaddha (Gonaddhapura)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the places passed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī's&lt;/a&gt; disciples on their way from Bāvarī's hermitage to see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  Between Gonaddha and their starting place lay &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patitthaana,Patitthāna')"&gt;Patitthāna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati,Māhissati')"&gt;Māhissati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, and the next stopping place after Gonaddha was Vedisā.  (Sn.vs.1011).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SnA.ii.583) says that Gonaddha was another name for Godhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gilānadassana Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Citta-gahapati lies ill various devas approach him and urge him to aspire to be a world-ruler.  He scorns the suggestion and, on being asked by his relations why he is talking to himself, he tells them and exhorts them to have faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  Soon afterwards he dies.  S.iv.302f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Galambatittha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon, which contained a vihāra and a thūpa.  King Vasabha repaired the thūpa, built an uposatha-house, and endowed land for the maintenance of lamps in the house (Mhv.xxxv.85).  The village is probably identical with that mentioned elsewhere as Galamba-titthagāma (Cv.lxxv.7).  In that case, it was in Rohana and was the scene of a battle in the campaign of Parakkamabāhu I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.i.57; VibhA.353) contain references to a group of fifty monks dwelling in Galambatittha Vihāra, who took a vow never to address each other until they attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See s.v.  Kalambatittha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godha Jātaka (No.138, 141, 325, 333)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Godha Jātaka (No.138).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a lizard and paid homage to a good ascetic living near the ant-hill where he dwelt.  The good ascetic left and was replaced by a wicked one, to whom the Bodhisatta paid like homage.  One day, the villagers brought a dish of lizard's flesh to the ascetic.  Being attracted by its flavour, he planned to kill the Bodhisatta, that he might have more of the flesh.  But the Bodhisatta discovered his intention just in time, and, making good his escape, denounced the hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a wicked monk.  J.i.480f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Godha Jātaka (No.141).-The Bodhisatta was born once as an iguana, leader of many others.  His son became intimate with a young chameleon, whom he used to clip and embrace.  The Bodhisatta warned his son against this unnatural intimacy, but, finding his advice of no avail, and knowing that danger would come to them through the chameleon, he prepared a way of escape, should the need arise.  The chameleon, growing tired of the friendship with the iguana, showed a trapper the home of the iguanas.  The trapper made a fire round the hole and killed many of the iguanas as they tried to escape, but the Bodhisatta reached safety through the hole he had provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told about a treacherous monk, identified with the young iguana (J.i.487f).  For details see the Mahilāmukha Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Godha Jātaka (No.325).-The story of the past is very similar to No.1 above, except that there is only mention of one ascetic and he is a hypocrite.  The young lizard threatened to expose the ascetic's hypocrisy and compelled him to leave the hermitage.  The story was related in reference to a monk who was a cheat and a rogue (J.iii.84f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cf.  the Kuhakabrāhmana Vatthu (DhA.iv.154f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Godha Jātaka (No.333).-A prince and his wife, returning after a long journey, were greatly distressed by hunger, and some hunters, seeing them, gave them a roasted lizard.  The wife carried it in her hand, hanging it from a creeper.  Arriving at a lake, they sat down at the foot of a tree, and while his wife was away fetching water the prince ate the whole lizard.  When his wife came back, he told her that the lizard had run away, leaving only the tail in his hand.  Later, the prince became king, but his wife, though appointed queen consort, received no real honour.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's minister, wishing to see justice done to the queen, contrived that the king should be reminded of his ingratitude by allusion being made to the incident of the roast lizard.  The king thereupon realised his neglect of his dutiful wife, and conferred on her supreme power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a couple who had been given a roast lizard, when returning from a journey undertaken to collect debts.  The husband ate the whole lizard when his wife was away.  She said nothing and drank some water to appease her hunger, but when they visited the Buddha, and be asked her if her husband were good and affectionate, she replied in the negative.  The Buddha then told her the story of the past.  J.iii.106f.; cf.  Succaja Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the special apartment occupied by the Buddha at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; monastery (J.i.92).  The building, of which the Gandhakuti formed a part, was evidently called the Gandhakuti-parivena, and there the Buddha would assemble the monks and address them (E.g., J.i.501; iii.67).  The site, on which stands the bed of the Buddha in the Gandhakuti, is the same for every Buddha, and is one of the unalterable sites - avijahitatthānāni (BuA.247).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Gandhakuti seems to have been used later in reference also to other residences of the Buddha.  Thus, we are told (AA.i.226; see C.S.B., Pl.5B) that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt; built a Gandhakuti for the Buddha in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbarama,Pubbārāma')"&gt;Pubbārāma&lt;/a&gt; with the money she obtained by the sale of her &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahalata_pasadhana,Mahālatāpasādhana')"&gt;Mahālatāpasādhana&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giri (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Giri.-A Nigantha who occupied the Niganthārāma, later destroyed by Vattagāmanī to make room for the construction of Abhayagiri Vihāra, The Nigantha's name was included in that of the new Vihāra.  Mhv.xxxiii.43f, 83; Dpv.xix.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Giri.-See Giridīpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Giri.-One of the palaces occupied by Sikhī Buddha in his last lay life (Bu.xxi.16).  The Commentary (BuA., p.201) calls it Giriyasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Giri.-A district in South Ceylon.  Its capital was Mahāgāma.  It included the villages of Nitthulavitthika, birthplace of Gothaimbara (Mhv.xxiii.49), and Kutumbiyangama, birthplace of Velusumana (Mhv.xxiii.68).  The district was also evidently called Girimandala.  The chieftain of Giri was Giribhojaka (Mhv.xxiii.69, 70, 75; MT.454), sometimes called Girimandalika (MT.452).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Giri.-A Nigantha who lived at Anurādhapura during the time of Pandukābhaya.  See also Giri (1).  Mhv.x.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giri (or Girimānanda) Sutta.-Preached at Jetavana.  Ananda brings news to the Buddha that Girimānanda is ill; would the Buddha go and visit him? The Buddha suggests that Ananda should repeat to Girimānanda the ten ideas (saññā) - anicca-saññā, anatta-saññā, asubha-saññā, ādīnava-saññā, pahāna-saññā, virāga-saññā, nirodha-saññā, sabbaloka-anabhirati-saññā, sabbasankhāresu anicca-saññā, and ānāpānasatisaññā - and proceeds to expound them in detail.  Ananda does so and Girimānanda recovers.  A.v.108ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghositārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Kosambī, built by Ghosita (Ghosaka, q.v.) for the use of the Buddha and the monks.  The Buddha often stayed there during his visits to Kosambī and numerous incidents are mentioned in the books in connection with the monastery.  It was because of a dispute between two monks of the Ghositārāma, one expert in the Vinaya and one in the Dhamma, that the first schism arose in the Order, driving the Buddha himself to seek quiet in the Pārileyyaka forest.  Vin.i.337f; M.i.320; DhA.i.44ff; the Kosambī monks were evidently somewhat peculiar (see Vin.iv.197).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at other times the Buddha seems to have sought solitude in this forest during his sojourns at the Ghositārāma (See, e.g., S.iii.96f).  It was here that the Buddha decreed the ukkhepaniyakamma for Channa, who refused to acknowledge and atone for his offences (Vin.ii.21f), and here that he laid down the procedure in that connection to be followed.  Devadatta was at Ghositārāma when he first conceived the idea of using Ajātasattu for his own ends (Vin.ii.184f).  The Buddha was there at the time and it is said that the devaputta Kakudha appeared before Mahā-Moggallāna to warn him of Devadatta's schemes.  The information was reported to the Buddha, who warned Moggallāna not to pass it on to others.  The Buddha then proceeded to tell Moggallāna of the five kinds of teachers which appear in the world (A.iii.122f).  Ananda is several times spoken of as staying in the Ghositārāma, sometimes with the Buddha, sometimes alone.  On one such occasion he asks the Buddha why women should suffer from certain disabilities as compared with men (A.ii.82).  And again (A.iii.132f), what are the circumstances which conduce to ease (phāsuvihāra) in the case of monks? Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the Buddha's teachings? Once Ananda visits (A.iv.37f), at her request, a nun living near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him.  The mere sight of him causes her recovery, but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and makes her realise the truth (A.ii.144f).  Among those who visit Ananda at the Ghositārāma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned: Ghosita (S.iv.113), Unnābha (S.v.271f.), a householder, follower of the Ajivikas (A.i.217f.), and Bhaddaji (A.iii.202).  Udāyī twice visits him there, once to ask for a description of consciousness (S.iv.169f.), and again to quote a verse uttered by Pañcālacanda devaputta and to ask Ananda to explain it (A.iv.449).  We find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by Ananda (A.iv.426f.).  Udāyī preached to large audiences at the Ghositārāma and was evidently appreciated, for we find Ananda reporting it to the Buddha and being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with acceptance (A.iii.184f.).  The Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ananda to the monks at the Ghositārāma of his own accord (A.ii.156f.).  Channa is several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the Ghositārāma.  Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on him.  A devoted householder, wishing to build a vihāra for him, asked him for a site.  Vin.iii.155f; mention is made of other misdemeanours which he committed in order to have a fine vihāra (Vin.iv.47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channa started cutting down trees and other things, in order to clear the site, and this led to great uproar.  On another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his colleagues and the Buddha chides him (Vin.iii.77, also iv.35f, 113. See also S.iii.132f).  It was when Channa was at the Ghositārāma that Ananda came, at the bidding of the monks, to inflict on him the brahmadanda (Vin.ii.292).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among others mentioned as staying at the Ghositārāma are Mūsila, Savittha, Nārada, in the company of Ananda (S.ii.115), Pindola Bhāradvāja - who converts Udena when the latter comes to see him (S.iv.110f.) and earns the Buddha's praises for his attainments (S.v.224) - Sāriputta and Upavāna (S.v.76), and Bāhiya and Anuruddha (A.ii.239).  Anuruddha is there at the time of the schism of the Kosambī monks but refuses to intervene.  He indulges, instead, in his powers of clairvoyance and mention is made of a visit paid to him by the Manāpakāyika-devas (A.iv.262f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dāsaka and a number of other monks were once staying in the Ghositārāma; on learning that Khemaka lies ill in the Badarikārāma, one gāvuta away, the others send Dāsaka several times to and fro to ask various questions of Khemaka.  In the end, Khemaka himself comes to them to solve their difficulties (S.iii.126f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kosambiya Sutta, Jāliya Sutta, Sandaka Sutta, Upakkilesa Sutta and Sekha Sutta, Dalhadhamma Jātaka, Kosambī Jātaka and Suripāna Jātaka, all preached while the Buddha was staying at the Ghositārāma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty thousand monks from the Ghositārāma, under the leadership of Urudhammarakkhita, were present at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa at Anurādhapura.  Mhv.xxix.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gūthakhādaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gūthakhādaka.  A peta.  A householder, in a village near Sāvatthi, built a vihāra for a monk who visited his house.  Other monks arrived, and the incumbent, envious of them, spoke ill of them to the householder who abused them all.  As a result, he was born a peta in the cesspit of the same monastery and came under the notice of Mahā Moggallāna.  Pv.iv.18; PvA.266f; cp.  ThagA.i.386f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gūthakhādaka.  Same as the above, except that in this case the householder was a woman.  Pv.iv.9; PvA.269.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gelañña Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gelañña Sutta.-The Buddha, staying at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, visits the sick ward in the evening and talks to the sick monks.  A monk, he tells them, should meet his end collected and composed.  He should put away the dejection arising from craving.  In whatever he does, he should act composedly.  So composed and collected, he becomes free from bondage.  When his body breaks up, he understands the matter and is prepared for it, for it is like a lamp which goes out when oil and wick are exhausted.  S.iv.210f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gelañña Sutta.-The topic is the same as in the above, but the wording differs.  S.iv.213f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gayā-Kassapa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhātika-Jatilā (q.v.).  On leaving the world with his brothers and becoming an ascetic, he gathered round him a company of two hundred other ascetics.  They all lived at Gayāsīsa, hence his name (Gayāsīse pabbajito ti Gayā Kassapo nāma jāto).  When Uruvela-Kassapa was converted, Gayā-Kassapa, with his followers, joined the Order, and at the conclusion of the Adittapariyāya Sutta they all became arahants (Vin.i.33f.; AA.i.165).  Gayā-Kassapa is reported (Thag.v.345f) to have said that he used to bathe three times a day at Gayātittha, in order to wash away his sins during the festival of Gayāphaggu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder, and later became a forest-dwelling hermit.  One day he saw the Buddha walking alone in the forest and offered him a kola-fruit (ThagA.i.417f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Koladāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.379; see also ii.483.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gayā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Gayāsīsa.  The Buddha describes to the monks some of the stages through which he passed before reaching Enlightenment.  At first he could only sec the light from the bodies of the devas; later, through conscious striving, he could distinguish their forms, talk with them, discover how they came to be born in their different spheres; then he was able to read their past births, and at last he attained to supreme knowledge.  A.iv.302ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gulavanna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A horse belonging to King Kutakanna-Tissa.  Once the king, on his way from Anurādhapura to Cetiyapabbata, came to the Kadamba river and found that his horse would not cross it.  When the trainer was blamed, he explained that the horse did not wish to have his tail wet, in case the king's dress should be spoilt.  The king held up the horse's tail, and he immediately crossed the stream (MA.ii.653f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to illustrate the good qualities of a well-trained horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gūthapāna Jātaka (No.227)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dung-beetle drank some liquor dropped by merchants staying in a rest-house and returned to his dung-heap intoxicated.  An elephant who came up smelt the dung and went away in disgust.  The beetle, thinking the elephant was frightened of him, called after him and challenged him to a fight.  The elephant returned, dropped some dung on him and, making water over him, killed him on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who quelled the pride of a rowdy; the latter used to molest monks who went for alms to a village near Jetavana, asking them questions and insulting them so much that the monks were reluctant to go there.  One day a monk, stronger than the rest, enticed the man out of the village, felled him with one blow, and threatened to teach him another lesson if he did not cease pestering the monks.  After that the man decamped at the sight of a monk.  J.ii.209ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godatta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Godatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He belonged to a family of caravan-leaders and, on the death of his father, travelled about himself with five hundred carts, engaged in trade.  One day, one of his oxen fell on the road, and seeing that his men could not get it up, Godatta went up and smote it.  The ox, incensed by this cruelty, assumed a human voice and, chiding him for his base ingratitude, cursed him.  Godatta, much moved, renounced all his property and joined the Order, in due course attaining arahantship (ThagA.i.555f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā (vs.659-72) contains several stanzas attributed to him, wherein he discoursed to "Ariyan" groups, both lay and religious, on lokadhammā (the nature of things?), illustrating his meaning with a wealth of simile.  He is probably the Godatta of the Godatta Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Godatta Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-His full name was Abhidhammika Godatta, showing that he was considered expert in Abhidhamma.  He was evidently a well-known Abhidhamma commentator and is quoted in the Visuddhi Magga (p.138), but it is said that his explanation was rejected in the Commentaries because it was only the Elder's personal view.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapāsādika (ii.307, also 478; iii.588), however, relates a story showing that the Elder was recognised as an authority on the Vinaya.  A monk of Antarasamudda made a drinking bowl out of a coco-nut shell and, leaving it in the monastery, went to Cetiyagiri.  Another monk, fancying the bowl, stole it and also went to Cetiyagiri, where he met the owner and was charged with theft.  Unable to settle the dispute where they were, they went to the Mahāvihāra.  There, by beating of drums, the monks were assembled near the Mahācetiya, and convicted the accused of theft, holding him guilty of a pārājikā offence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godatta, being interviewed, pointed out that the value of the bowl was only a penny or two and that the Buddha had nowhere laid down that the theft of such an insignificant object could be held a pārājikā offence.  His decision was greeted with applause, and when the report thereof reached the reigning king, Bhātiya, he decreed that, henceforth, in all their disputes, his subjects should abide by the decision of Godatta.  v.l.  Godha, Godhaka, Goda, Gotta, Godanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Godatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An incumbent of Kalyāni-mahāvihāra in Ceylon.  He would procure his food when the shadow of the sun was two inches long and eat it when it was but one inch.  Even when no sun was to be seen, he knew the time exactly.  The people discovered this by watching him and set their "clocks" by his movements.  MA.i.100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gulissāni Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta notices among the monks at Rājagaha an uncouth monk from the wilds who is named Gulissāni.  Sāriputta proceeds to talk to the other monks of the duties of a bhikkhu who, coming from the wilds, starts to live in the confraternity; he should show respect and consideration to others, be correct in the matter of seats, observe certain rules in begging for alms, and keep watch over his faculties while studying the higher Dhamma and Vinaya.  Moggallāna asks whether these duties are incumbent only on those monks who come from the wilds, and is told that they are still more so on monks living in villages.  M.i.469ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gothakābhaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gothakābhaya, Gothābhaya.-A king of the Rohana dynasty; son of Yatthālayakatissa and father of Kākavannatissa (Mhv.xv.170; xxii.11).  He is sometimes called Abhaya.  E.g., Mhv.xxiii.10, 56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gothakābhaya.-King of Ceylon (302-15 A.C.).  He was a Lambakanna of Mahiyangana, and having gone to Anurādhapura with Sanghatissa and Sanghabodhi, he, with their help, slew the reigning king, Vijaya, and they reigned in succession (Mhv.xxxvi.58).  Gothakābhaya became Sanghabodhi's treasurer but, seeing the king's weakness, he led a rebellion against him and captured the throne (vv.91, 98-117; for details see Sanghabodhi).  In addition to other religious works, he built the Meghavannābhaya-Vihāra.  He banished from Abhayagiri sixty monks who had accepted the Vetulla heresy, but a Cola monk, Sanghamitta, defeated in discussion the thera Gothābhaya, the king's uncle, and became the king's favourite, obtaining the position of tutor to the king's two sons, Jetthatissa and Mahāsena.  The king was also known as Meghavannābhaya (v.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godatta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation between Godatta and Cittagahapati at the Ambātakavana in Macchikāsanda.  Godatta asks Citta about the different kinds of heart's release (cetovimutti) - appamānācetovimutti, ākiñcaññācetovimutti, suññatocetovimutti and animittācetovimutti.  Citta explains them and points out how, according to one view, these states are diverse both in spirit and in letter and how, according to another, they are the same in spirit, though diverse in letter.  S.iv.295f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gotama &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gotama Thera.-He belonged to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and was initiated at the age of seven.  When he was seventeen, he fell into bad company, gave all he had to a courtesan and broke his vow of celibacy.  He was then filled with remorse at the thought of what he had done, but the Buddha appeared before him and he entered the Order, becoming an arahant in the tonsure-hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a householder in the time of Vipassī Buddha and had given to the Buddha an āmoda-fruit (Thag.137f.; ThagA.i.256f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Amodaphaliya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.447.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gotama Thera.  He belonged to the Sākiyan clan and came to be known only by his gotta-name.  He entered the Order when the Buddha visited his kinsfolk and, in due course, became an arahant.  In the time of Sikhī Buddha he had offered eight campaka-flowers at the Buddha's thūpa (Thag.258-60; ThagA.i.374f).  He is evidently identical with Citapūjaka of the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apadāna.  Ap.ii.407.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gotama Thera.-Also called Aparagotama.  He was older than the Buddha and belonged to an Udicca-brahmin family of Sāvatthi.  He was learned in the Vedas and was an unrivalled orator.  When the Buddha came to Sāvatthi for the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and entered the Order, attaining arahantship in the tonsure-hall.  When he returned to Sāvatthi, after a long residence in the Kosala country, many of his relations, eminent brahmins, came to him and counselled him as to the various gospels (suddhivādā) current among the people; he told them of the Buddha's teaching.  Thag.587-96; ThagA.i.529f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Gotama Thera.-An arahant, living in Piyangudīpa.  He was the teacher of Dutthagāmani (Mhv.xx.69).  When the latter, during his flight from his brother, wished to give alms to a monk before eating, Gotama knew his desire and sent a monk named Tissa to accept the alms.  When the food was brought to Piyangudīpa, Gotama offered morsels of it to five hundred monks (twelve thousand, according to Mhv.xxxii.65) and, refilling the bowl with scraps of food, sent it back by air to the prince (Mhv.xxiv.24, 30; MT.465).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Gotama.-The name of the clan to which the Buddha and the Sākiyans belonged.  The members of the clan, though khattiyas, claimed descent from a brahmin isi, Gotama (For an explanation of this see Thomas, op.  cit., 22f).  Gotama and Angiras are both enumerated in the Pravara ceremony as the ancestors of the Gotama clan (Asvalāyana, Srauta-sūtra, 12, 11, 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Buddhists appear to have forgotten the Vedic rsi, for, according to an ancient legend, Okkāka, the immediate ancestor of the Sākiyans, was born of an egg formed of the coagulated blood and semen of an ascetic Gotama, as he lay impaled for the alleged murder of a courtesan.  The egg was hatched by the sun (Mtu.i.338ff; Rockhill, Buddha, 9f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama is the name by which the Buddha is addressed by brahmins and others who are not his followers.  In one place, at least, the Buddha is represented as addressing the Sākiyans as "Gotamā." (S.iv.183).  The Gotama-gotta is classed among the higher gottas, together with such gottas as Moggallāna, Kaccāyana and Vāsettha (Vin.iv.6; DA.i.246f, uccākula-paridīpanam).  According to the Theragāthā Commentary (ii.204; also AA.i.395; Gotama-buddhassa sāvako pi Gotamo), the Buddha's disciples (e.g., in the case of Vangisa) were also called Gotama, even when they did not naturally belong to that clan.  See also Sakyā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Gotama.-A brahmin sage, his full name being Angirasa Gotama.  See Angirasa (7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Gotama.-The name of the brahmin chaplain in the Bhikkhāparampara Jātaka.  The scholiast adds that it was his gotta-name (J.iv.371, 372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Gotama.-A mountain near Himavā (Ap.i.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Gotama.-A thera in Ceylon who wrote a Sinhalese paraphrase to the Sambandhacintā.  He belonged to the Araññavāsī sect and was a pupil of Vanaratana Ananda (P.L.C.199, 220).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Gotama.-See Ālavi-Gotama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;11.

Gilāna Vagga.-The thirteenth chapter of the Pañcaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.142-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gilāna Vagga.-The eighth chapter of the Salāyatana Samyutta.  S.iv.46-53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gilāna Vagga.-The second chapter of the Bojjhanga Samyutta.  S.v.78.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gilāna Sutta.-There are three types of sick men - those who will not, in any case, recover; those who recover whether looked after or not; those who recover only if properly looked after.  Even so, there are three kinds of men - those who will never, whether they hear the Dhamma or not, enter into an assurance of perfection, etc.  A.i.120f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits a sick novice of no reputation and talks to him.  The novice, pondering on the Buddha's words, re-covers.  S.iv.46; cf.  S.iii.119.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gilāna Sutta.-The same as the above, except that the topic is final emancipation without grasping (anupādā parinibbāna).  S.iv.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits Mahā Kassapa lying ill in the Pippalīguhā, and talks to him of the seven bojjhangas.  Delighted with the talk, Kassapa recovers.  S.v.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Gilāna Sutta.-Describes a similar visit to Mahā Moggallāna at Gijjhakūta.  S.iv.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha lies ill in the Kalandakanivāpa in Veluvana; Mahā Cunda visits him, and they talk of the seven bojjhangas.  The Buddha immediately recovers.  S.v.81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Gilāna Sutta.-Once, shortly before his death, the Buddha spent the rainy season in Beluva, where he became seriously ill.  By great effort of will he overcame the sickness.  Ananda expresses his admiration for the Buddha's strength of mind, but adds his conviction that the Buddha would not die without having made some pronouncement concerning the Order.  Then follows the Buddha's famous injunction to his followers that they should take no other guide or refuge but the Dhamma and their own selves.  S.v.152f.; the sutta is found almost verbatim in D.ii.98f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Gilāna Sutta.-The Buddha visits the sick ward in the Kūtāgārasāla in Vesāli and talks to a sick monk, telling him that by practising five things during illness one can be sure of the speedy destruction of the āsavas, these things being asubhānupassanā, āhārepatikūlasaññā, sabba-loke anabhiratasaññā, sabbasankhāresu aniccānupassanā and marana-saññā.  A.iii.142; cf.  Giri Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gotamaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gotamaka.-A class of ascetics, enumerated in a list of such classes.  (A.iii.276. Does deva-dhammikā in Ap.ii.358 (vs.11) qualify Gotamā?) Rhys Davids thinks they were almost certainly the followers of some other member of the Sākiyan clan, as distinct from the Buddha, and suggests that it might have been Devadatta or possibly a brahmin of the Gotamagotta.  (Dial.i.222; but see his article on Buddhist Law in ERE.; see also Brethren 265, n.3).  The Lalita-vistara (p.492), however, speaks of the Gautamas in a list of nine such sects; the Gotamakas and the Gautamas are evidently identical, as several of the other classes correspond with the Pāli.  According to the Lalita-vistara, these sects existed even before the Buddha, for they are represented as meeting and addressing him in the sixth week after the Enlightenment, on his way to the Ajapāla-tree.  We hear no more of them in subsequent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gotamaka.-A yakkba.  See Gotamakacetiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gotamaka.-See Kanha-Gotamaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gaddula Sutta &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gaddula Sutta (v.l.  Baddula).&lt;/b&gt;-Incalculable is the beginning of samsāra and the untaught puthujjana, having wrong notions of self, revolve from birth to birth, like a dog tied by a leash to a pillar or stake round which it unceasingly chases.  S.iii.149.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gaddula Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Just as a dog tied by a leash to a strong pillar cannot escape, so the untaught puthujjanas cannot escape from the five khandhas.  Mind is even more diverse than a show piece (caranacitta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a painter fashions all kinds of likenesses, so the puthujjana creates and recreates the five khandas.  S.iii.151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guttasāla, Guttasālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village and a district in Rohana.  Dutthagāmanī lived there before being crowned at Mahāgāma (Mhv.xxiv.17).  Guttasāla was thirty to thirty-five miles to the north of Mahāgāma, where the high road crossed the Mānikagañga, and lay on the main route which spread from Mahāgāma to Mutiyangana, and from there along the Mahāvālukagangā to Pulatthipura; hence its strategic importance.  It was the centre of several campaigns at different periods.  (E.g., of Mahinda, Cv.li.109, 117; Vijayabāhu I., Cv.lxviii.34; Jayabāhu I., Cv.lxi.12; Parakkamabāhu I., Cv.lxxiv.165f.; lxxv.15. See Cv.Trs.i.158, n.4).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atthasālinī (DhsA.398f) records the story of a nun of Guttasāla; she was an arahant, and when the village was destroyed by bandits she left it with a young nun carrying her baggage.  At the village gate of Nakulanagara she met Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, who offered her a meal in his own bowl, as she had none of her own.  She ate the meal, washed the bowl and returned it, telling him that from the next day he would get alms without exertion; and so he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhamādana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain range beyond the seven ranges of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cullakāla&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mahākāla&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nāgapalivethana&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candagabbha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suriyagabbha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suvannapassa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava,Himavā')"&gt;Himavā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one of the five mountain ranges that encircle&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta,Anotatta')"&gt;Anotatta&lt;/a&gt;.  It is crowned with a tableland, is green in colour (muggavanna), and covered with various medicinal plants.  It shines from afar "like a glowing fire on a new-moon night." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the range is an inclined slope (pabbhāra) named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara,Nandamūlaka')"&gt;Nandamūlaka&lt;/a&gt; containing three caves, Suvanna-, Mani- and Rajata-guhā, which are the abodes of Pacceka Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the entrance to Maniguhā is a tree named Mañjūsaka, one league in height and in girth; on this tree bloom all the flowers that grow both on land and in water, and especially do they bloom on the occasions of the Pacceka Buddhas' visits; round the tree is the Sabbara-tanamāla.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the Sammajjanakavāta sweeps the ground, the Samakaranavāta levels the sand, and the Siñcanakavāta sprinkles water from Anotatta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugandhakaranavāta brings all the perfumes of Himavā, the Ocinakavāta plucks flowers, and the Santharanakavāta spreads them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the māla seats are always ready for the Pacceka Buddhas, who on fast days and on their own birthdays assemble there.  When a new Pacceka Buddha arises in the world, he goes first to Gandha-mādana and other Pacceka Buddhas, who may be in the world, assemble there to greet him, and they all sit rapt in samādhi.  Then the senior among them asks the new-comer to describe how he came to be a Pacceka Buddha (SNA.i.52, 66f; ii.437; AA.ii.759; UdA.300, etc.; MA.ii.585).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pacceka Buddhas who live on Gandhamādana will often enter into samādhi for seven days, and at the end of that period seek alms from someone on whom they wish to bestow a special favour, that he may thereby obtain merit (E.g., DhA.iii.368f; iv.121, 199f; J.iv.16).  These Buddhas will sometimes leave the mountain, and, having admonished those whom they wish to help, return again (E.g., J.iii.453).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Pacceka Buddhas, others are also mentioned as having resided in Gandhamādana - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naarada,Nārada')"&gt;Nārada&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.393), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n1_nan,Nalinikā')"&gt;Nalinikā&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.186), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/b,Bahusodarī')"&gt;Bahusodarī&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.83); also the deva king &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nagadatta,Nāgadatta')"&gt;Nāgadatta&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.138), and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara,Vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt;, with his family, after he renounced his kingdom (J.vi.528f.).  It is also said that Kinnaras (J.iv.438) and Nāgas (Rockhill, 169) lived on the slopes of Gandhamādana.  It was among the places visited by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata,Khadira-vaniya Revata')"&gt;Khadira-vaniya Revata&lt;/a&gt; (AA.i.139).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not explicitly mentioned that all Pacceka Buddhas die in Gandhamādana, but the inference seems to be such.  Thus, once, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapaduma,Mahāpaduma')"&gt;Mahāpaduma&lt;/a&gt; died there, and their bodies were cremated (ThagA.ii.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka Commentary (vi.79) explains Gandhamādana as gandhena mada-karo pabbato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fragrant tree Bhujaka grows only in heaven and in Gandhamādana (VvA.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya,Metteya')"&gt;Metteya&lt;/a&gt; will retire for a while to Gandhamādanā, after spending his first rainy season (Anāgatavamsa v.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghatāsana Jātaka (No.133)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was king of the birds and lived with his subjects in a giant tree, whose branches spread over a lake.  The Nāga king of the lake, Canda, enraged by the dropping of the birds' dung into the water, caused flames to dart up from the water to the tree, and the Bodhisatta, perceiving the danger, flew away with his flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk whose but was burnt by fire.  The villagers undertook to build him another, but there was a delay of three months, during which the monk with no shelter could not proceed in his meditation.  The Buddha chided him for not seeking another shelter.  J.i.471f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangā &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gangā (Modern Ganges).-One of the five great rivers (Mahānadī) that water Jambudīpa, the others being Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī (E.g., Vin.ii.237; S.ii.135; v.401; A.iv.101; v.22; Mil.114 mentions ten).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.438f; AA.ii.761ff; MA.ii.586; UdA.301) give a long description of their origin.  From the Anotatta lake flow four rivers: that from the south circles the lake three times under the name of Avattagangā, then as Kanhagangā flows straight for sixty leagues along the surface of a rock, comes into violent contact with a vertical rock, and is thrown upwards as a column of water three gāvutas in circumference; this column, known as Akāsagangā, flows through the air for sixty leagues, falls on to the rock Tiyaggala, excavating it to a depth of fifty leagues, thus forming a lake which is called Tiyaggalapokkharanī; then the river, under the name of Bahalagangā, flows through a chasm in the rock for sixty leagues, then, under the name of Ummaggagangā, through a tunnel for a further sixty leagues, and finally coming upon the oblique rock Vijjha, divides into five streams, forming the five rivers above mentioned.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among places mentioned as being on the banks of the Gangā are Benāres, Campā, Ayojjha, Kimbhilā, Ukkāvelā, Payāga, Pātaliputta, and Sankassa.  The Gangā formed one of the most important means of communication and trade for the districts through which it flowed - e.g., from Rājagaha to Vesāli.  The district to the north of the river and bordering on the kingdom of Anga was called Anguttarāpa (SNA.ii.439).  The river was five hundred leagues in length (SA.ii.119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the Gangā appears again and again in similes and metaphors in the Pāli books: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;its sands are immeasurable (S.iv.376); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;its waters cannot be made bracken by adding to them a grain of salt (A.i.250); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is full of foam, and yet its foam is empty (S.iii.140); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;it were folly to wish to hold up the course of its waters with one's fist (S.iv.298); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as the river finds repose only in the ocean, so do the followers of the Buddha find repose only in nibbāna (M.i.493);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some things are as inevitable as that the Gangā should flow into the sea (S.iv.179); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there is no such thing as the Gangā apart from its sand, its water, and its banks; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;to be cast on the other side of the Gangā (pāragangāya) is great misfortune (see, e.g., S.i.207, SnA.i.228).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gangā flows from west to east (pācīnaninnā, S.iv.191); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;during the rains it is so full of water that even a crow could drink water from its bank (Vin.i.230); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;sometimes the banks would be flooded and the buildings on them destroyed (SA.i.164), and people would find difficulty in crossing; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;at others it was shallow and could be crossed by means of a reed bridge (SnA.i.18); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cattle could easily be driven from one bank to another (M.i.225).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At various spots were ferries where boatmen plied for hire (e.g., J.iii.230).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its banks, on the higher reaches, were numerous snakes and parrots (J.ii.145, iii.491), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and all along the banks were hermitages (e.g., J.iii.476, v.191, etc.).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men always bathed in the river, and on festival days even women of very good family came for water-sports, sometimes spending the whole day in the river; kings also came with their retinues (e.g., J.i.295; MA.ii.604; DhA.iii.199).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference is also made to a Gangāmahīkīlā, (Smp.  on Vin.i.191, and again, ii.276).  Buddhaghosa says that Mahī here refers to the earth, but Rhys Davids (VT.ii.25, n.3) thinks it refers to the river of that name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The junction of the Gangā and the Yamunā is frequently referred to, and is used as a simile for perfect union (e.g., J.vi.412, 415).  A tributary of the Gangā is mentioned which flows from Himavā, its name being Migasammatā (J.vi.72).  The ford at Pātaliputta, where the Buddha crossed on his way from Rājagaha to Vesāli, was called Gotamatittha (Vin.i.230); its distance from Rājagaha was five leagues, and from Vesāli three (KhpA.162-3).  When the Buddha, after curing the plague at Vesāli, returned to Rājagaha, great festivities marked the event, and the celebration was known as the Gangārohana.  The devas and the nāgas vied with each other to do honour to the Teacher, and there was a great assembly of all classes of beings, comparable to those on the occasions of the Twin Miracle and the Descent from Tusita (DhA.iii.444).  Among the nāgas who dwelt in the Gangā is mentioned Eraka (DhA.iii.231).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The water of the Gangā was considered holy and was used for the consecration of kings, not only of India but also of Ceylon (Mhv.xi.30; MT.305).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people on the northern bank were rough and coarse, while those on the south were pious and generous, believers in the Buddha (DA.i.160).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper reaches of the river were called Uddhagangā (J.ii.283, vi.427) or Uparigangā (J.iv.230), and the lower reaches Adhogangā (J.ii.283, 329, v.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kosikī, Bhagīrathī, Mahāgangā, and Pāragangā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gangā.-See Mahāvālukagangā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Gangā.-A lake, the residence of the Nāga king Dona.  BuA.153.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghata Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are staying at the Kalanda-kanivāpa and, in the course of their conversation, it transpires that Moggallāna, exercising clairvoyance and clairaudience, had seen and heard the Buddha, then dwelling in Jetavana.  The subject of his talk was consummate energy (āraddhaviriya).  Sāriputta declares that, in comparison with Moggallāna, he himself is like a mound of gravel set up alongside the Himālaya.  Moggallāna returns the compliment by saying that, beside Sāriputta, he is like a pinch of salt set up alongside a large jar of salt, and recalls the high praise bestowed on Sāriputta by the Buddha himself.  S.ii.275f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhāra Jātaka (No.406)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of Gandhāra, and he and the king of Videha became friends, though they never saw each other.  One day the Gandhāra king saw an eclipse of the moon and, being stirred in his mind, left his kingdom and became an ascetic in Himavā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Videha king, hearing of this, did likewise.  They met in Himavā, but failed to recognise each other until, seeing another eclipse of the moon, they exchanged reminiscences.  They went out begging together, and the Videha ascetic, having once been given a large quantity of salt, stored up some of it for a saltless day.  The Gandhāra ascetic, finding this out, blamed his friend for his greediness, and the latter begged his forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Videha ascetic is identified with Ananda.  The story was told in reference to the occasion of the passing of the rule forbidding monks to store medicine for more than seven days.  J.iii.363ff; the introductory story is given in Vin.i.206ff; see also Pilindavaccha; the Jātaka story is given in MA.i.534f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gajakumbha Jātaka (No.345)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a minister of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  Noticing that the king was slothful, the Bodhisatta took a tortoise as an object lesson, showing him how the indolent came to misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was slothful regarding his duties.  J.iii.139f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guhatthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second sutta of the Atthakavagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata,Sutta Nipāta')"&gt;Sutta Nipāta&lt;/a&gt;; it was preached to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola,Pindolabhāradvāja')"&gt;Pindolabhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;.  He once went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udakavana,Udakavana')"&gt;Udakavana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, and there the women of King Udena's palace, who had come to the park with the king, left the king while he slept, and, finding the Elder, sat down and listened to his preaching.  The king, awakening, went in search of them, and was angry when he discovered their where-abouts.  He questioned Pindola as to the solitude which he professed to seek in the park, but Pindola refusing to answer, the king threatened to set red ants at him.  Thereupon Pindola went through the air to the Buddha's &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; and related the story.  The Buddha was reclining on his bed and, in that position, preached this sutta to the Elder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man who clings to the body and to the pleasures of the senses, lives in constant fear.  One should therefore cast off greed and cross the flood, unstained by the world (SN.vv.772-9; SNA.ii.514ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta probably derives its name from the fact that, in the first verse, the body is spoken of as a guhā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is commented on in the Mahā Niddesa pp.23ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gopaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Gopaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera.  He once stayed at the Kukkutārāma in Pātaliputta, where he was given a set of robes.  Vin.i.300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Gopaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A king of ninety-one kappas ago; he offered kanavera-flowers to the Buddha.  He was a previous birth of Kanaverapupphiya.  Ap.i.182.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Gopaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A deva.  He had been a Sākiyan maid of Kapilavatthu named Gopikā (Gopī), who led a virtuous life and, according to the Buddha's teaching, had cultivated the thoughts of a man.  After death she was born as a devaputta in Tāvatimsa.  There, when he saw monks reborn as Gandhabbas, he rebuked them for having neglected their opportunities.  A series of verses attributed to Gopaka are given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girikanda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain occupied for some time by Pandukābhaya during his campaign against his uncle.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the neighbourhood of this mountain that Pandukābhaya met and married Suvannapāli (Mhv.x.28ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district around it was called Girikanda-desa, and this was later given by Pandukābhaya to his father-in-law, Girikandasiva (Mhv.x.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhodaka (-kadāyaka) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Once, when celebrations were being held in honour of the Bodhi-tree of Padumuttara Buddha, he poured fragrant water from a painted pot on to the tree.  There was a thunderstorm and he was killed on the spot by lightning.  Being born in heaven, he uttered stanzas in praise of the Buddha and his teaching.  One hundred and twenty-eight kappas ago he became a king, named Samvasita.  Ap.i.105f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghata Jātaka (No.355, 454).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ghata Jātaka (No.355).-The story of Ghatakumāra (q.v.).  It was related in reference to a minister of the Kosala king.  He had been the king's favourite, but then, influenced by slanderers, the king cast him into prison, where he entered the First Path.  When he was released he visited the Buddha, who told him the Jātaka story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with King Vanka of the Jātaka.  J.iii.168ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ghata Jātaka (No.454).-The story of the Andhakavenhudāsa-putta (q.v.) and of the manner in which Ghatapandita (q.v.) assuaged the grief of his brother, Vāsudeva.  The introductory story resembles that of the Matthakundali Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohineyya is identified with Ananda and Vāsudeva with Sāriputta (J.iv.79ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Jātaka perhaps influenced the story of Ummādacittā found in the Mahavamsa (ix.13); for its connection with the Harivamsa, see ZDMG.53, 25ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangātata, Gangātataka, Gangātalāka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tank in Ceylon, built by Aggabodhi II.  (Cv.xlii.67).  The country around the tank was used as a base in Parakkamabāhu's war against Gajabāhu (Cv.lxx.286, 300).  Gajabāhu lived there in comparative peace during his last days, and he also died there (Cv.lxxi.l, 5).  Later, Māgha and Jayabāhu erected fortifications in Gangātata (Cv.lxxxiii.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is identified with the modern Kantalai.  See Cv.Trs.i.310, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gajjabāhukagāmani&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Gajabāhu; king of Ceylon (174-96 A.C.); son of Vankanāsika-Tissa.  He founded the Mātu Vihāra in honour of his mother, made additions to the Abhayagiri Cetiya, constructed the Gamanitissa tank, and built the Rāmuka Vihāra and the Mahejāsana-sālā (Mhv.xxxv.115ff; Dpv.xxii.13, 28,29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later chronicles be is credited with having invaded the Cola kingdom to avenge a raid made on Ceylon and with having introduced the cult of the goddess Pattini into Ceylon.  See Codrington, Short History of Ceylon, pp.23f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghata &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ghata&lt;/b&gt; (also called &lt;b&gt;Ghatakumāra&lt;/b&gt;).  The Bodhisatta, born as the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  One of his ministers misconducted himself in the royal harem and the king, catching him in the act, banished him.  The minister took service with Vanka, king of Sāvatthi, and persuaded him to attack Benares.  Ghata was captured and thrown into prison, where he entered into ecstatic meditation.  But Vanka was seized by a burning sensation, and he ordered the release of Ghata and the restoration of his kingdom.  J.iii.168f; cf.  Ekarāja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ghata &lt;/b&gt; (also called &lt;b&gt;Ghatapandita&lt;/b&gt;).-The Bodhisatta, born as the ninth of the ten &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa,Andhakavenhudāsaputtā')"&gt;Andhakavenhudāsaputtā&lt;/a&gt;.  When a son of his brother, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasudeva,Vāsudeva')"&gt;Vāsudeva&lt;/a&gt;, died, Vāsudeva lamented beyond all measure, and Ghata, wishing to cure him, feigned madness and went about Dvāravatī asking for the hare in the moon.  When Vāsudeva heard of this from his courtier Rohineyya, he hastened to Ghata and argued with him about the ridiculousness of his quest.  The plan succeeded and Vāsudeva was cured of his grief.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Godhāvarī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Godhāvarī.  (v.l.  Godāvari).-A river in Dakkhināpatha, of which it forms the southern boundary.  During the Buddha's time, the Alaka (or Mulaka) king and the Assaka king (both Andhakas) had settlements on its northern bank, and Bāvarī's hermitage lay in the territory between their dominions (SN.vs.977).  The Commeutary (SNA.ii.581) says that near this spot the Godhāvarī divided into two branches, forming an island three leagues in extent, and the island was a dense forest, known as the Kapitthavana.  Bāvarī's hermitage occupied a region of five leagues.  In the past this region had been the abode of various sages, such as Sarabhanga (J.v.132, 136; Mtu.i.363).  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.182), Bāvarī's hermitage was on a bend of the river (Godhāvarīvanke).  The Godhāvarī is one of the holiest rivers in Southern India, rising in Brahmagiri near the village of Triyanvaka and sanctified by its connection with Rāma and various saints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Godhāvarī.-A canal, built by Parakkamabāhu I., connecting the Kāragangā and the Parakkamasāgara (Cv.lxxix.57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gangeyya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Gangeyya.-Adjective formed from Ganga (J.ii.151).  The description "Gangeyya nāgaraja" in J.iii.362 probably means a nāga king "dwelling in Ganga" and not "named Gangeyya."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Gangeyya.-One of the ten families of elephants.  Each elephant had the strength of one hundred men.  MA.i.262; AA.ii.822; BuA.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giribhanda-(vāhana)-pūjā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great festival, instituted by King Mahādāthika-Mahānāga on the Cetiyagiri mountain.  Carpets were laid from the Kadambanadī to the mountain, in order that people might approach the mountain with clean feet; the road was decorated and illuminated, shops were erected and largesse distributed.  There were mimes, songs and music.  Lamps were lit throughout the island and even on the sea for one yojana round (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff; AA.i.13).  It is said (Vsm.376; Vsm.Trs.ii.436, n.4) that on the day of the festival Māra, wishing to spoil it, rained down a shower of coal, but an Elder created earth in the sky, thus preventing the coal from falling.  The most costly offerings given during this feast to any monk - namely, a pair of garments - fell to the lot of a young novice, Lonagirivāsī Tissa, in spite of the efforts of the king's ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks.  It was because the novice had practised the sārānīya-dhammā (DA.ii.535; AA.ii.653f; MA.i.545f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival was probably connected with the Giribhanda-vihāra, in which case that was the reason for the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guttilavimāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna visits Tāvatimsa and, seeing thirty-six goddesses whose palaces were next to each other, questions them as to their acts in the past, and reports their answers to the Buddha.  The Buddha replies that those same goddesses were in Tāvatimsa at the time of Guttila's visit; he then proceeds to give an account of Guttila.  Vv.iii.5; VvA.137ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gopaka Moggallāna (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gopaka Moggallāna.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin minister of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt;, in charge of some defence works in Rājagaha (M.iii.7).  See Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta.  The Theragāthā (vs.1024) contains a stanza spoken by Moggallāna Thera in answer to a question by Gopaka Moggallāna.  Gopaka asks Moggallāna how many of the Buddha's teachings he remembers.  Eighty-four thousand, answers the latter and proceeds to explain.  ThagA.ii.130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Soon after the Buddha's death, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; for alms, visits the place where Gopaka Moggallāna was strengthening the city's defences.  Moggallāna asks him if there were any monk in every way like the Buddha, and receives a negative answer.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara,Vassakāra')"&gt;Vassakāra&lt;/a&gt; arrives and, on being told the topic of conversation, asks the same question and is told by Ananda that the monks regard the Dhamma as their protector.  It is true, however, that there are monks whom they hold in great esteem and reverence, and Ananda enumerates the qualities which win for them such homage.  M.iii.7ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandamba&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mango-tree, at the gate of Sāvatthi, under which the Buddha performed the Yamaka-pātihāriya (q.v.).  The king's gardener, Ganda, while on his way to the palace to give the king a ripe mango-fruit from the palace gardens, saw the Buddha going on his alms-rounds and offered him the mango.  The Buddha ate it immediately, and gave the seed to Ananda to be planted by the gardener at the city-gate.  A tree of one hundred cubits sprouted forth at once, covered with fruit and flowers.  At the foot of this tree Vissakamma, by the order of Sakka, built a pavilion of the seven kinds of precious things.  J.iv.264f; J.i.88; DhA.iii.206ff; Mil.349.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gagga Jātaka (No.155)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a trader's son in Kāsi.  One day during their travels father and son were obliged to take lodging in a hall haunted by a yakkha.  In the case of persons occupying this hall, if one of them should happen to sneeze and the other failed, thereupon, to wish him long life, the yakkha was allowed to eat them.  This boon had been granted him in return for twelve years' services to Vessavana.  The two travellers from Kāsi took up their abode in the hall for one night, during which the father sneezed.  The son, knowing nothing of his danger, said nothing, but on seeing the yakkha preparing to eat him, he guessed the reason and hastened to wish his father long life.  The father acted likewise, and the yakkha was foiled in his attempt on their lives.  The Bodhisatta, having heard the yakkha's story, established him in the five precepts.  The story became known, and the Bodhisatta was given the post of general, while the yakkha was made tax-gatherer.  In the story the Bodhisatta addresses his father as Gagga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was preaching, he sneezed, and all around him shouted "Long Life," thus interrupting his sermon.  The Buddha told them that the custom was superstitious, and forbade them to follow it.  On their obeying him, the common people blamed them for their lack of good manners.  The Buddha, thereupon, withdrew the injunction and related this story to account for the origin of the custom.  (J.ii.15f.; the introductory story is found in Vin.ii.140).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gagga is identified with Mahā Kassapa.  J.ii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghatīkāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great Brahmā.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehalinga, looking after his blind parents.  He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares.  It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghatīkāra's house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghatīkāra's piety.  Once, when Ghatīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha's suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata.  For three months Ghatīkāra's house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith (Mil.223f).  According to the Nalapāna Jātaka (J.i.172), no rain will ever fall on the site of Ghatīkāra's' house as long as this kappa lasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghatīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghatīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghatīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force.  Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghatīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world.  Kikī, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghatīkāra returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself (M.ii.46ff; S.i.35f; Bu.xxv.41; SnA.i.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death, Ghatīkāra was born as a Mahābrahmā in the Avihā Brahma-world, and an anāgāmī.  He was evidently already a Sakadāgāmi before his death (see DhA.i.380), but he did not wish his attainments to be known (AA.i.44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He provided the Buddha with the eight requisites of a monk when the Buddha, having left the world, decided to lead the life of a bhikkhu (J.i.65; SnA.ii.382; BuA.236; VvA.314).  The begging bowl, then provided by him, vanished when the Buddha was given a bowl of milk rice by Sujātā (J.i.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.35f; 60), Ghatīkāra visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship.  Ghatīkāra, on that occasion, speaks of several others (besides Jotipāla) who had been his friends in Vehalinga - Upaka, Phalaganda, Pukkusāti, Bhaddiya, Khandadeva, Bāhuraggi and Pingiya.  They had listened to the Buddha's teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihā-world, where he himself was.  In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gandhavamsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A late Pali work written in Burma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It relates, in brief, the history of the Pāli Canon and gives accounts of post-canonical Pali books written in Burma and Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colophon states that the work was composed by a forest-dwelling Elder named Nandapañña.  At the end of each chapter the work is referred to as Cullagandhavamsa; perhaps what we have now is an abridged edition of a larger work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is published in J.P.T.S., 1886, pp.55-80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gajabāhu, Gajabhuja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (1137-1153).  He was the son of Vikkamabāhu II.  and succeeded his father to the throne (Cv.lx.88, according to the Dimbulāgala Inscription, his mother was Sundarī).  Thus he was the grandson of Vijayabāhu I and of Tilokasundarī, and came, therefore, of Kālinga stock.  When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamabāhu (afterwards Parakkamabāhu I.), Gajabāhu sent for him with many marks of favour and welcomed him at his court.  In order to win the king's confidence Parakkama gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajabāhu was becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to wage war against him.  In the campaign that followed, Gajabāhu suffered many reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama's forces.  With great difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime Mānābharana managed to get Gajabāhu into his power and cast him into a dungeon.  From there he was rescued by Parakkamabāhu and fled to Kotthasāra.  Meanwhile, Parakkamabāhu had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura.  Gajabāhu, being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamabāhu left to Gajabāhu the enjoyment of his possessions.  (This is rather odd, especially in view of the fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53).  Gajabāhu took up his abode at Gangātalāka and spent his last days there in comparative peace.  As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to Parakkamabāhu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vihāra.  He was cremated at Kotthasāra.  (Details of Gajabāhu's reign and his fights with Parakkamabāhu are contained in the Cūlavamsa, particularly in chapters 63, 66, 67, 70, 71).  See also Gajabāhukagāmani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giraggasamajjā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A festival held from time to time (kālānukālam) in Rājagaha.  (Perhaps elsewhere as well.  The BuA.  p.102 says it was an annual festival held all over Jambudīpa and was as old as Dīpankara Buddha; see also J.iii.538).  It was held in the open air in the afternoon and was attended by all people of all grades of society from Anga and Magadha.  Special seats were prepared for the more eminent of the audience, and the festivities seem to have consisted chiefly of nautch dances (SNA.i.326).  According to the Vinaya accounts (Vin.ii.107f, 150; iv.85, 267) there were also singing and music, and the festival was attended not only by laymen, but also by members of religious orders, for otherwise it is unlikely that the Sattarasavaggiyas and the Chabbaggiyas would have been there.  Food was provided as well as amusements.  Buddhaghosa (Sp.iv.831) explains the name of the festival thus: giraggasamajjo ti girimhi aggasamajjo girissa vā aggadese sammajo, and tells us that it was announced for seven days before its commencement, and was held on level ground under a shadow of a hill and outside the city.  Perhaps it was originally a pagan religious festival, a survival of old exogamic communistic dancing (See Dial.i.7, n.4; VT.iii.71, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at a Giraggasamajjā that Sāriputta and Moggallāna decided to leave the world (DhA.i.73f.; AA.i.89, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit equivalent is Girivaggu-samāgama.  AvS.ii.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gorimanda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rich man of Mithilā.  He had no children and was ugly; when he spoke saliva flowed from his mouth, and two beautiful women, standing beside him, wiped his face with blue lilies and threw them away.  When revellers had no money wherewith to buy flowers, they would stand outside Gorimanda's house and call out for him.  When he leaned out of the window to ask what they wanted, his face had to be wiped with lilies and the lilies were then thrown away.  The revellers picked them up, washed them, and wore them at their revels.  J.vi.367f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ghosa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ghosa&lt;/b&gt;.-The village in which Buddhaghosa was born.  Sās.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ghosa, Ghosaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A devaputta, Kotūhalaka, in a previous birth.  Unable to make a living in his own country, he left it and came with his wife and child to a herdsman's house, where, having eaten too heartily after a long period of starvation, he died and was born as a dog in the same house, because be had envied a bitch which lived there.  When the dog grew up, it used to accompany the herdsman on a visit to a Pacceka Buddha, who had meals in his house.  Sometimes, when the herdsman was unable to go himself, be would send the dog to summon the Pacceka Buddha.  The road led through a forest and the dog would bark aloud to frighten away the wild beasts.  One day, when the Pacceka Buddha went elsewhere, the dog died of a broken heart and was reborn in Tāvatimsa as the god Ghosa or Ghosaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was later reborn as Ghosaka-setthi.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gāthā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A portion of the Tipitaka classified according to the matter (anga) of each one.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes the Dhammapada, the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā, and those suttas, composed of stanzas only, found in the Sutta Nipāta and not included under the term Sutta.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gotamaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached to the monks at the Gotamakacetiya.  The Buddha declares that his proclamation of a Dhamma is with full comprehension, with casual connection (sanidānam), and accompanied by wonders.  His instructions are with reason (A.i.276f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that at this pronouncement the thousand fold universe trembled (Also DA.i.130; J.ii.259).  The Majjhima Commentary (i.49) states that the Sutta was preached to the monks mentioned in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and that, at the end, they became arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gotamakacetiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrine near and to the south of Vesāli (D.iii.9).  It was considered one of the beautiful spots of that town (E.g., D.ii.102, 118) and the Buddha stayed there several times, particularly during the first years of his ministry (Thus AA.i.457).  During one such stay, he laid down the rule which allowed monks the use of three robes; he himself felt cold during the night and had to wear extra clothing (Vin.i.288; iii.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrine was pre-Buddhistic and dedicated to a Yakkha named Gotamaka.  A vihāra was later built on the spot for the Buddha and his monks (UdA.322; DhA.iii.246; AA.i.457; SNA.i.344).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There the Gotamaka Sutta was preached.  (And, according to some, also the Hemavata Sutta [SNA.i.199]).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Divyāvadāna (p.201), in a list of noted places of Vesāli, speaks of a Gautama-nyagrodha.  The reference is evidently to this cetiya.  It has been suggested that the cetiya may have been called after the Kāla (Kanha) Gotama Nāgas, but the suggestion appears far-fetched.  See J.  P.T.S.1891, p.67; Windisch: Mara and Buddha, p.68; cp.  J.ii.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Giridanta Jātaka (No.184)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Sāma of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; had a state horse Pandava, whose trainer was the lame Giridanta.  Observing that his trainer limped, the horse imitated him.  When the king saw the horse limping, not being able to discover the reason, he asked his adviser, the Bodhisatta, to investigate the matter.  The Bodhisatta reported that it was the result of evil association, and had the trainer replaced by another.  The trainer was Devadatta (J.ii.98f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the introductory story see the Mahilāmukha Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Girikassapa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eldest son of Upatissa III.  He had sixteen brothers.  When Silākāla rose in revolt, Kassapa defeated him in several contests, and in the end pursued him to his stronghold in the Pācīnapabbata, riding to the summit of the mountain on his elephant.  This deed earned for him the title of Girikassapa.  Later, while fleeing with his parents from Silākāla, he lost his way and was surrounded by his enemies.  Finding no way of escape he cut his throat.  Cv.xli.11ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ganadevaputtā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.737) the palaces of the Ganadeva-puttas (Ganadevaputtānañ ca vimānāni) among those seen by King Nemi as he was being conducted by Mātali through the deva-worlds.  I cannot trace the name in the Nimi Jātaka.  The word may be used as a collective noun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vātaggasindhava Jātaka (No.  266)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as the state horse of the king of Benares, his name being Vātaggasindhava.  A she ass, Kundalī, fell in love with him and refused to eat.  Her son discovered this, and made the horse agree to come and see her after his bathe.  But when the horse came, Kundalī, not wishing to make herself cheap, kicked him on the jaw and nearly killed him.  The horse was ashamed and did not repeat his visit, and Kundalī died of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi, with whom a beautiful woman fell desperately in love.  Her friends, with great difficulty, persuaded him to visit her one night, but she was capricious and rejected his advances.  He went away never to return, and she died of love.  When he heard of her death, he sought the Buddha, who told him the story.  The she ass is identified with the woman.  J.ii.337ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsettha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vāsettha.&lt;/b&gt; The constant attendant of Nārada Buddha.  J.i.37; Bu.x.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vāsettha, Vāsittha.&lt;/b&gt; The name of an old rsi held in high esteem for his knowledge.  He was one of the originators of the Vedic runes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.245; D.i.104; M.ii.164, 200; Mil.162, etc.; cf.  Vasistha in Vedic Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vāsettha.&lt;/b&gt; Name of a gotta, probably tracing its descent to the sage Vāsettha (Skt.  Vasistha).  In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.147, 159) we find the Mallas of Kusināra addressed as Vāsetthā, as well as the Mallas of Pāvā (D.iii.209).  It was a gotta held in esteem (ukkattha).  E.g., Vin.iv.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vāsettha.&lt;/b&gt; A young brahmin who, with his friend Bhāradvāja, visited the Buddha and held discussions with him.  These discussions are recorded in the Tevijja Sutta, the Vāsettha Sutta, and the Aggañña Sutta.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.399; SNA.ii.463; cf.  SN., p.116) that Vāsettha was the chief disciple of Pokkharasāti.  According to him again (DA.ii.406; cf.iii.860, 872), Vāsettha's first visit to the Buddha was on the occasion of the preaching of the Vāsettha Sutta, at the conclusion of which he accepted the Buddha as his teacher.  He again did so, when, at his next visit, the Buddha preached to him the Tevijja Sutta.  Soon after, he entered the Order, and, at the conclusion of the preaching of the Aggañña Sutta, he was given the higher ordination and attained arahantship.  He belonged to a very rich family and renounced forty crores when he left the world.  He was an expert in the three Vedas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vāsettha.  &lt;/b&gt; A lay disciple, evidently distinct from Vāsettha (3).  He visited the Buddha at the Kūtagārasālā in Vesāli and the Buddha preached to him (A.iv.258).  See Vāsettha Sutta (2).  He is mentioned among the Buddha's eminent lay disciples.  A.iii.451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vāsettha.  &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin; see Dhūmakāri.  The scholiast explains (J.iii.402) that he belonged to the Vāsetthagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Vāsettha.  &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Kapilavatthu, father of Vappa Thera.  ThagA.i.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Vāsettha.&lt;/b&gt; A very rich brahmin, father of Sela Thera.  Ap.i.318.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vācissara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vācissara.  &lt;/b&gt; A Singhalese monk who wrote Commentaries to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhadatta,Buddhadatta')"&gt;Buddhadatta's&lt;/a&gt; works: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhammaavataara,Abhidhammāvatāra')"&gt;Abhidhammāvatāra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vinaya_vinicchaya,Vinaya-Vinicchaya')"&gt;Vinaya-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaravinicchaya,Uttara-Vinicchaya')"&gt;Uttara-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khemappakarana,Khemappakarana')"&gt;Khemappakarana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He probably belonged to the twelfth century, and was also the author of the Rūpārūpa-Vibhānga and the Sīmālankāra (q.v.).  P.L.C.108f., 156, 174, 202; also Gv.62, 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vācissara.&lt;/b&gt; A monk of Ceylon, pupil of Sāriputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous works are assigned to him, among them commentaries on the various books of grammar: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Sambandhacintā tīkā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Subodhālankāra tīkā &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Vuttodayavivarana.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote the Sumangalapasādanī on the Khuddasikkhā and a commentary on the Moggallānavyākarana (P.L.C.  204).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seems also to have written the Pāli Thūpavamsa and several books in Singhalese.  P.L.C.217; also Gv.62, 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vācissara Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Probably identical with (2) above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was at the head of the Sangha in the reign of Vijayabāhu III., and had hidden the Alms bowl and Tooth relic of the Buddha in Kotthumala, in order to preserve them.  After that, he went to South India for protection.  Later, he was sent for by Vijayabāhu, whom he helped in the reformation of the Sangha.  Cv.lxxxi.18ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vannī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people inhabiting the north east of Ceylon.  They are first mentioned in the Chronicles (Cv.lxxxi.11), in the reign of Vijayabāhu III.  (1232 36), who, with their help, gained the throne of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They appear to have inhabited the frontier country between Jaffna and the Singhalese kingdom and were either subjects of one or other of these states, or affected complete independence, according to the strength of their neighbours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijayabāhu IV.  made friends with the Vanni chiefs and gave into their hands the protection of Anurādhapura (Cv.lxxxviii.87).  They seem to have been a warlike people.  Today they occupy a few small villages in the North Central Province of Ceylon and go in largely for hunting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their origin is unknown, though they are called Sīhalā (E.g., Cv.lxxxiii.10).  Several of their chieftains are mentioned by name, as having been overcome by Bhuvanekabāhu I.  - e.g., Kadalīvāta, Apāna, Tipa, Himiyānaka (Cv.xc.33).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adjective from Vannī is Vañña.  See, e.g., Cv.lxxxiii.10; lxxxvii.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsabhagāmī, Vāsabhagāmika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera, pupil of Anuruddha Thera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the four Pācīnaka monks appointed to the committee (ubbāhikā) which considered the Ten Points raised by the Vajjiputtakā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fellow pupil was Sumana, and they had both seen the Buddha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vankanāsika Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (171 4 A.C.).  He was the son of Vasabha and his wife was the daughter of King Subha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He built the Mahā-mangala-vihāra and his wife built the Mātu-vihāra in honour of a monk who had given her his blessing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vankanāsika's son was Gajabāhukagāmanī.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanga, Vangā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people and their country, the modern Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is nowhere mentioned in the four Nikāyas, nor included among the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"&gt;Mahājanapadas&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihabaahu,Sīhabāhu')"&gt;Sīhabāhu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihasiivali,Sīhasīvalī')"&gt;Sīhasīvalī&lt;/a&gt; was a Vanga princess, the daughter of the Vanga king who had married the daughter of the king of Kalinga (Mhv.vi.1ff.; Dpv.ix.2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milinda (p.  359) mentions Vanga as a trading place to be reached by sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vattaniya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hermitage (senāsana) where lived Rohana Nāgasena's teacher, by whom he was ordained, and Assagutta, with whom he spent a vassa in order to train himself for debate.  Mil.  10, 12, 14; from the context it would appear as though these two residences were not identical, but were far away from each other.  Was Vattaniyasenāsana rather a generic than a proper name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assagutta, who ordained the Ajīvaka Janasāna (q.v.), is also said to have been "Vattaniyasenāsane." (MT.  192).  At the ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa foundation, the Thera Uttara came from "Vattaniyasenāsana" in Viñjhātavī with sixty thousand others (Mhv.xxix.40).  Both the Visuddhimagga and the Atthasālinī (Vsm.430; DhSA.419) mention a Thera named Assagutta, evidently a visitor, who, seeing the monks at Vattaniyasenāsana eating dry food, resolved "Every day before meals may the pool of water take on the taste of milk curds." From that day the pool water tasted of curds before the meal and became natural water again after the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanganta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (SNA.i.331; UdA.266) (q.v.) and husband of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rupasari,Rūpasārī')"&gt;Rūpasārī&lt;/a&gt; (Ap.i.102).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brahmin Mahāsena was his friend, and the son of another friend became Sāriputta's attendant (DhA.ii.94).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimsiila_s,Kimsīla Sutta')"&gt;Kimsīla Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanavāsī &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vanavāsī (Vanavāsika) Tissa.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk.  In his previous birth he was the brahmin Mahāsena (q.v.).  During pregnancy his mother invited Sāriputta with five hundred monks, to her house, and fed them on milk rice.  She herself put on yellow robes and ate of the rice left by the monks.  On the day of his naming, he presented Sāriputta with his blanket.  He was called Tissa after Sāriputta, whose personal name was Upatissa.  At the age of seven Tissa joined the Order and his parents held a festival lasting for seven days, distributing porridge and honey to the monks.  On the eighth day, when Tissa went for alms in Sāvatthi, he received one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand pieces of cloth, all of which he gave to the monks.  This earned for him the name of Pindapātadāyaka.  One day, in the cold season, he saw monks warming themselves before fires and, discovering that they had no blankets, he, accompanied by one thousand monks, went into the city.  Wherever he went people gave him blankets; one shopkeeper had hidden two of his very costly blankets, but on seeing Tissa he gave them willingly.  Tissa thus got one thousand blankets and was thereafter called Kambaladāyaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having discovered that, at Jetavana, his young relations came too often to see him, he obtained a formula of meditation and went into the forest to a distance of twenty leagues from Sāvatthi.  At the request of the inhabitants of the village near by, he spent the rainy season in the forest hermitage, going into the village for alms.  There, at the end of two months, he attained arahantship.  Because he was so devoted to the forest, he was given the name of Vanavāsī.  At the end of the vassa, all the Buddha's chief disciples, with a retinue of forty thousand monks, visited Tissa in his hermitage, arriving there in the evening.  The villagers, recognizing Sāriputta, asked him to preach the Dhamma, saying that Tissa, their teacher, knew only two sentences "May you be happy, may you obtain release from suffering!" which sentences he repeated whenever anyone made him a gift.  Thereupon Sāriputta asked him to explain the meaning of the two sentences, and the novice preached till sunrise, summarizing the whole of the Buddha's teaching “even as a thunderstorm rains incessantly upon the four great continents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse Tissa's supporters were divided into two camps, some were offended that he should not have preached to them before, while others marvelled at his saintliness and skill.  The Buddha, aware of this disagreement, went himself to the village.  The villagers gave alms to the Buddha and the monks, and, in returning thanks, the Buddha told them how fortunate they were that, owing to Tissa, they had been able to see himself and his chief disciples.  They were then all satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way back to Sāvatthi, Tissa walked beside the Buddha and pointed out to him the various beautiful spots.  The Buddha preached the Upasālhaka Jātaka to show that there was no spot on earth where men had not at some time died.  In answer to a question of the Buddha, Tissa said that he never felt afraid of the animals in the forest, but only a greater love for the forest at the sound of their voices.  He then recited fifty stanzas in praise of life in the wilds.  Arrived at the outskirts of the forest, he took leave of the Buddha and Sāriputta and returned to live in his forest hermitage.  DhA.ii.84-102. The visit of Buddha is also reported at DA.i.240 and MA.i.357, though the details are the different.  There the Buddha is accompanied by Sāriputta and the chief disciples and twenty thousand arahants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vanavāsī Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The Theragāthā Commentary (i.440) mentions a Vanavāsī Thera as the teacher of Tekicchakāni.  This is probably not a proper name but only a descriptive epithet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanavāsī Nikāya&lt;/b&gt;.  See Araññavāsī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vanavāsī Mahātissa.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk, probably distinct from Vanavāsī Tissa - see Vanavāsī (1).  On the day that Alindakavāsī Mahā Phussadeva Thera attained arahantship, the devas stood by him, illuminating all the forest.  Mahātissa saw the light, and the next day asked Phussadeva the reason for it, but his question was evaded.  SA.iii.154f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vātamiga Jātaka (No.  14)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  He had a gardener named Sañjaya.  A vātamiga used to visit the royal park, and the king asked Sañjaya to catch it.  Sañjaya put honey on the grass where the animal fed, and, in due course, the animal came to eat out of his hand.  He was thus able to entice it right into the palace, where he shut the door on it.  The king marvelled that a vātamiga, who was so shy that if it once saw a man it would not visit the same place for a week after, should allow itself to be caught by greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Cullapindapātika Tissa (q.v.), who was enticed back to the lay life by a slave girl.  Sañjaya is identified with the slave and the vātamiga with the monk.  J.i.156ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.199), however, it was with reference to Sundarasamudda that the story was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vakkali &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vakkali Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and became proficient in the three Vedas.  After he once saw the Buddha he could never tire of looking at him, and followed him about.  In order to be closer to him he became a monk, and spent all his time, apart from meals and bathing, in contemplating the Buddha's person.  One day the Buddha said to him, "The sight of my foul body is useless; he who sees the Dhamma, he it is that seeth me" (yo kho dhammam passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so dhammam passati) (Cp.  Itv.  sec.  92).  But even then Vakkali would not leave the Buddha till, on the last day of the rains, the Buddha commanded him to depart.  Greatly grieved, Vakkali sought the precipices of Gijjhakūta.  The Buddha, aware of this, appeared before him and uttered a stanza; then stretching out his hand, he said: "Come, monk." Filled with joy, Vakkali rose in the air pondering on the Buddha's words and realized arahantship.  AA.i.140f.; the Apadāna account (Ap.ii.465f.) is similar.  It says that the Buddha spoke to him from the foot of the rock.  Vakkali jumped down to meet the Buddha, a depth of many cubits, but he alighted unhurt.  It was on this occasion that the Buddha declared his eminence among those of implicit faith; also DhA.iv.118f.  The DhA.  reports three verses uttered by the Buddha in which he assures Vakkali that he will help him and look after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Theragāthā, Commentary (ThagA.i.420), when Vakkali was dismissed by the Buddha he lived on Gijjhakūta, practising meditation, but could not attain insight because of his emotional nature (saddhā).  The Buddha then gave him a special exercise, but neither could he achieve this, and, from lack of food, he suffered from cramp.  The Buddha visited him and uttered a verse to encourage him.  Vakkali spoke four verses (Thag.350 4) in reply, and, conjuring up insight, won arahantship.  Later, in the assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared him foremost among those of implicit faith (saddhādhimuttānam) (cp.  A.i.25; also Dvy.49 and VibhA.276; Vsm.i.129).  In the Pārāyanavagga (SN.  vs.  1146) the Buddha is represented as holding Vakkali up to Pingiya as an example of one who won emancipation through faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta account (S.iii.119ff.; SA.ii.229) gives more details and differs in some respects from the above.  There, Vakkali fell ill while on his way to visit the Buddha at Rājagaha, and was carried in a litter to a potter's shed in Rājagaha.  There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him.  He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals (sīlato); his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier.  The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him.  After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kālasilā on Isigili.  The Buddha was on Gijjhakūta and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to "obtain release." The Buddha sent word to him: "Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil." Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha's message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other khandhas, he drew a knife and killed himself.  The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbāna and that Māra's attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds that Vakkali was conceited and blind to his remaining faults.  He thought he was a khīnāsava, and that he might rid himself of bodily pains by death.

Vajirā Therī.&lt;/b&gt; The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.134f) relates that one day, when she was taking her siesta in Adhavana at Sāvatthi, Mārā questioned her as to the origin of “being" (satta), its creator, its origin, its destiny.  Vajirā answers that there is no such thing as “being," apart from certain conditioned factors, like a chariot, which exists only because of its parts.  Māra retires discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vajirā's verses are often quoted (E.g Kvu.  240, 626; Mil.  p.28; Vsm.ii.593) both in the Canon and in later works, but they are not included in the Therīgāthā, nor do we know anything else about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vajirā.&lt;/b&gt; A city in which reigned twenty six kings, descendants of Deva.  The last of them was called Sādhina (Dpv.iii.20).  The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.128, 130) calls the city Vajiravutti.  According to the Buddhavamsa (Bu.xxviii.8), the Buddha's bowl and staff were deposited, after his death, in Vajirā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vajirā.&lt;/b&gt; Wife of Sakkasenāpati, the son of Kassapa V.  She built a parivena, which was named after her.  Cv.lii.52, 62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

J.vi.170-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vārunī Jātaka (No.  47)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta once had a friend who was a tavern keeper.  One day the tavern keeper made ready a supply of strong spirits and went to bathe, leaving his apprentice, Kondañña, in charge.  The latter, who had seen customers send for salt and jagghery to make their drink more appetizing, pounded some salt and put it in the liquor, hoping to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a friend of Anāthapindika who was a tavern keeper, whose apprentice did likewise.  J.i.251ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vārunī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to slave women, attendants of Varuna.  They live in dread of him.  J.vi.500, 501. At J.vi.586 Vāruni is explained as yakkhāvitthā ikkhhanikā (fortune tellers possessed by a Yakkha, the Yakkha being perhaps Varuna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanasa (Vanasāvhaya ?)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city, lying between Vedisā and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, on the road taken by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī's&lt;/a&gt; disciples (SN.  vs.  1011).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary states (SNA.ii.583) that this was another name for Tumbavanagara (v.l.  Pavana), and that it was also called Vanasāvatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vangīsa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vangīsa Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Preached by the Buddha at Aggālava cetiya.  Vangīsa's teacher, Nigrodhakappa, had just died there, and Vangīsa asks the Buddha if he had attained Nibbāna.  Vangīsa's question is really a poem in itself, containing ten verses, in praise of the Buddha.  The Buddha says that Kappa has won Nibbāna, because he had severed all the bonds of Māra.  Vangīsa then declares that Kappa attained that state because he followed the Buddha's teaching.  SN.  pp.  59ff.; the verses of the sutta are included in the Theragāthā (1263 79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Commentary (SNA.i.345) the sutta is called Nigrodhakappa Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vangīsa Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; A set of ten verses, spoken by Vangīsa at Jetavana, soon after winning arahantship, as he sat experiencing the bliss of emancipation.  He congratulates himself on having become a disciple of the Buddha.  S.i.196; the verses are included in Thag.1253-62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vadhukā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a young wife is first led home she is full of fear and bashfulness, not only towards her relations but also towards the servants.  So is a monk who has just entered homelessness full of fear and bashfulness, even before novices of the monastery.  As time goes on, this feeling, in both cases, gives place to boldness.  But a monk should always be like a newly wed wife.  A.ii.78f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vamsā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vamsas and their country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lay to the south of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, and its capital was Kosambī (E.g., J.iv.28) on the Yamunā.  Udena, son of Parantapa, also called Vamsarājā (E.g., J.iv.370,390), was its king in the time of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti,Avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; lay to the south of the Vamsa country.  The Vamsā were also called Vatsā (Bud.  India, 3, 27; Mtu.i.34).  The country formed one of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadā')"&gt;Mahājanapadā&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district of Bhagga, in which was Sumsumāragiri, seems to have been subject to the Vamsā in the Buddha's time, for we find Udena's son, Bodhi, living there (J.iii.157, also Mahābhārata ii.30, 10f).  In nominal lists (E.g., D.ii.200) the Vamsā, are generally mentioned with the Cetī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanaropa (or Vacana) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha says, in answer to a deva's question, that those who plant groves and fruitful trees and build causeways, dams and wells, and give shelter to the homeless, increase in merit every day.  S.i.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccha or Bandha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation between the Buddha and Vacchagotta Paribbājaka.  Vacchagotta asks, and the Buddha explains, why, unlike the various Paribbājakas, the Buddha does not say whether the world is eternal or not, or make various similar statements.  Vacchagotta puts the same question to Moggallāna and receives the same answer.  Vacchagotta expresses his admiration of the fact that teacher and pupil should agree so closely.  S.iv.395f.; cp.  S.iii.257f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vacchanakha Jātaka (No.  235)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Vacchanakha, an anchorite living in the Himālaya, and on one occasion, having gone to Benares for salt and seasoning, he stayed in the king's garden.  A rich man saw him and, pleased with his looks, attended to his wants.  A friendship soon grew up between them, and the rich man invited the hermit to give up his robes and share his wealth.  But this offer the hermit refused, pointing out the disadvantages of household life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an attempt of Roja, the Malla, friend of Ananda, to tempt the latter back to the worldly life by offering him half his possessions.  Roja is identified with the rich man of the story.  J.ii.231ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vājapeyya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sacrificial offering; the Commentaries (E.g., ItvA.  75, 76) give it two interpretations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) Greeting people kindly with soft and pleasant speech (peyyavajjam, piyavācatā); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) a sacrifice in which Soma (Vāja) is drunk.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second seventeen animals are offered seventeen times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vassa Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk asks the Buddha why it sometimes rains.  It rains when the Vassavalākaka devas wish to revel their bodies answers the Buddha.  S.iii.257.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vassa Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Just as rain, falling on mountain tops, flows into gullies, pools, great lakes and rivers and from there into the ocean, so do the virtues of the Ariyan disciple flow onwards and lead to the destruction of the āsavas.  S.v.396.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vassa Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; On five things which stop rain: the fiery element raging in the upper air, the windy element, Rāhu, the indolence of the rain clouds, the wickedness of men.  A.iii.243.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsettha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vāsettha Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The young brahmins, Vāsettha and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja,Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;, fell to discussing one day, at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/iccaananagala,Icchānankala')"&gt;Icchānankala&lt;/a&gt;, as to what makes a true brahmin.  Bhāradvāja maintained that it was pure descent from seven generations of ancestors, with neither break nor blemish in the lineage, whereas Vāsettha contended that virtue and moral behaviour made a true brahmin.  As neither could convince the other, they agreed to refer the matter to the Buddha, who said it was not birth but deeds which made the true brahmin.  M.ii.196ff.  The sutta also occurs in SN., p.115ff.; many of the verses are included in the Brāhmana Vagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapada,Dhammapada')"&gt;Dhammapada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vāsettha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The lay disciple Vāsettha visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; and states that it would be a good thing for them, for many a day, if his kinsmen, brahmins, trades folk, labourers, etc., kept the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt; with the eightfold qualifications.  The Buddhaagrees, and says, further, that it would be good if not only gods and men but even the trees were to keep it.  A.iv.258.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vātakālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executioner of Rājagaha who worked for fifty years and then retired because of old age.  As he had no time for luxuries during his years of work, on the day of his retirement he asked his wife to cook milk rice and went to bathe.  On his way home, clad in clean garments, his body perfumed, he met Sāriputta, invited him to his house, and gave him various delicacies.  At the end of the meal he accompanied the Elder for some distance, and, on his return, was gored to death by a cow with calf.  After death he was reborn in Tāvatimsa.  AA.i.368.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajjiputtaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Vajjian monk visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, and complains that he has to recite over two hundred and fifty rules twice a month.  "I cannot stand such training," he says.  The Buddha then asks him if he can train himself in three particulars.  The monk agrees to do this and is told to develop higher morality, the higher thought and higher insight (adhisīla, adhicitta, adhipaññā).  The monk develops these, and, as a result, gets rid of lust, malice, and delusion.  A.i.230f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsava&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;.  S.i.221, 223, 229 30, 234 7; D.ii.260, 274; SN.vs.384; DhA.iii.270; J.i.65, etc.; Cv.xxxvii.151, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several explanations are given of the title.  In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.229; cp.  DhA.i.264) it is said that when he was a human being, in his previous birth, he gave dwelling places (āvasatham adāsi) - hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dīgha Nikāya (D.ii.260), however, he is Vāsava because he is chief of the Vasū (Vasūnam settho), whom &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; (DA.ii.690) calls Vasudevatā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A female crocodile in the river longed to eat his heart and her husband persuaded the monkey to go for a ride on his back in search of wild fruits.  In midstream he began to sink and revealed his purpose, and the monkey, nothing daunted, said that monkeys did not keep their hearts in their bodies for fear of their being torn to pieces on the trees, but that they hung them on trees, and, pointing to a ripe fig tree, showed the crocodile what he said was his heart.  The crocodile took him to the tree, and the monkey jumped ashore and laughed at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha.  J.iii.133f.; cf.  Sumsumāra Jātaka (No.  208).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajjita Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a retainer's (ibbha) family in Kosala, and, because he had come from the Brahma world, he wept whenever a woman took him in her arms.  Since he thus avoided the touch of women, he came to be called "Vajjita." When of age, he saw the Buddha's Twin Miracle, entered the Order, and on that same day attained arahantship with six fold abhiññā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty five kappas ago he was born in a remote village as a woodsman, and seeing the Pacceka Buddha, Upasanta, he offered him a campaka flower (ThagA.i.336).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses spoken by him are included in the Theragāthā (vss.215-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Ekacampakapupphiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.288.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Valāhaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Valāhaka.  &lt;/b&gt; A family of horses from which the Assaratana of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt; is supplied (KhpA.  172; M.iii.174).  He is best among animals, because he takes his rider away from all danger (MA.ii.616).  Noble chargers come from the Valāhaka stock.  DhA.iii.248.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Valāhaka.&lt;/b&gt; The name of the horse of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s,Mahāsudassana')"&gt;Mahāsudassana&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vacchapāla Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He belonged to a rich brahmin family of Rājagaha.  He witnessed the miracles performed by Uruvela Kassapa and his self submission to the Buddha when they visited Bimbisāra together, and marvelling thereat, entered the Order.  Within a week he developed insight and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had been a brahmin, expert in brahmin lore, and one day, while seeking a suitable person to whom he might give a large vessel of milk rice left over from the sacrifice, he saw Vipassī Buddha and offered it to him.  Forty one kappas ago he became a king named Buddha (Thag.71; ThagA.i.159f).  He is probably identical with Pāyāsadāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.157.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vasala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh sutta of the Uragavagga of the Sutta Nipāta.  It was preached at Sāvatthi to the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja (it is thus also called the Aggikabhāradvāja Sutta, SNA.174), who reviled the Buddha, calling him outcaste (vasala) when the Buddha went to his house for alms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha replied that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of vasala, nor what makes a man such.  At the request of the brahmin he preached this sutta, the burden of which is that it is not by birth that one is an outcaste or a brahmana, but by one's deeds (SN., pp.  21f).  The Sutta is also included in the Parittas (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vattakālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village near Girikandaka vihāra.  A girl of this village soared into the sky by the power of her rapture when thinking of the Buddha.  Her parents went to the monastery, leaving her at home as she was unfit to walk.  From her home she saw the monastery lighted up and heard the monks chanting, and was so filled with rapture that she was transported to the vihāra.  Vsm.i.143f.; DhSA.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajirāvudha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weapon of Sakka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he were to strike with it the Sinerupabbata, the weapon would pierce right through the mountain, which is one hundred and sixty eight thousand yojanas in height.  SNA.i.225.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaddha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vaddha.&lt;/b&gt; A Licchavi.  He was a friend of the Mettiyabhummajakā (q.v.), and, at their instigation, charged Dabba Mallaputta with having committed adultery with his wife.  Dabba repudiated the charge, and the Buddha ordered the monks to proclaim the pattanikkujjana on Vaddha.  When Ananda visited Vaddha and told him this news he fell in a faint, and, later, visited the Buddha with his family to ask for forgiveness.  He was ordered to go before the Sangha and confess his error, after which the sentence was revoked.  Vin.ii.124ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Vaddhamāna Thera (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vaddha Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a householder's family of Bhārukaccha.  His mother (Vaddhamātā) left the household, entrusting him to her kinsfolk, joined the Order and became an arahant.  Vaddha became a monk under Veludatta and developed into an eloquent preacher.  One day he visited his mother alone and without his cloak, and was rebuked by her.  Agitated by this, he returned to his monastery, and, during his siesta, developed insight, attaining arahantship.  ThagA.i.413f.  Six of his verses appear in Thag.335-9; ep.  Thig.210-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vangīsa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family and was proficient in the Vedas.  He gained repute by tapping on skulls with his finger nail and telling thereby where the owners of the skull were reborn.  During three years he thus gained much money.  Then, in spite of the protests of his colleagues, he went to see the Buddha, who gave him the skull of an arahant (according to the Apadāna, he saw Sāriputta first and learnt from him about the Buddha).  Vangīsa could make nothing of this and joined the Order to learn its secret.  He was ordained by Nigrodhakappa, and, meditating on the thirty two constituents of the body, he won arahantship.  He then visited the Buddha again and praised him in various verses, full of similes and metaphors.  This brought him reputation as a poet (Kāvyacitta or Kāveyyamatta).  Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those pre eminent in ready expression (patibhānavantānam).  His resolve to attain to this position was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  A.i.24; Dpv.iv.4; ThagA.ii.192ff.; AA.i.149ff.; DhA.iv.226f.; SNA.i.345f.; Ap.ii.495ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā contains numerous verses spoken by him on various occasions (Thag.1208 79; most of these are repeated at S.i.183ff ) some of them (1209-18) uttered about himself, his attempts to suppress desires excited by the sight of gaily dressed women (Cf.  S.i.185; on one such occasion, he confessed his disaffection to Ananda, who admonished him.); others (1219-22) were self admonitions against conceit because of his facility of speech; some were spoken in praise of sermons preached by the Buddha - e.g., the Subhāsita Sutta (1227-30), a sutta on Nibbāna (1238-45), and a sutta preached at the Pavārana ceremony (1231-7).  Several verses were in praise of his colleagues - e.g.  Sāriputta (1231-3), Aññā Kondañña (1246-8), and Moggallāna (1249-51).  One of Vangīsa's long poems (vvs.  1263-74) is addressed to the Buddha, questioning him as to the destiny of his (Vangīsa's) teacher Nigrodhakappa.  The Commentary (ThagA.ii.211) explains that when Nigrodhakappa died Vangīsa was absent and wished to be assured by the Buddha that his teacher had reached Nibbāna.  But the poem is more than a question.  It is really a eulogy of the Buddha.  Another verse (1252) describes the Buddha as he sat surrounded by his monks on the banks of the Gaggarā at Campā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta (S.i.185ff.; SA.i.207ff ) devotes one whole section to Vangīsa, dealing with the incidents connected with his life and giving poems made by him on these occasions.  The Milinda (p.  390)'also contains a poem attributed to Vangīsa in praise of the Buddha.  According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.497, vs.27), he was called Vangīsa, both because he was born in Vanga and also because he was master of the spoken word (vacana).  See also Vangīsa Sutta and Subhāsita Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanavaccha Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vanavaccha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the son of Vacchagotta a brahmin of Kapilavatthu, and was born in the forest, his mother having longed to see it and having been taken in travail while wandering there.  His name was Vaccha; but because of his love for the woods, he was called Vanavaccha.  He left the world soon after the Buddha's Renunciation, and led the ascetic life till he heard of the Buddha's Enlightenment.  Then he joined the Order, and it was in the forest that he strove and won arahantship.  When he returned to Kapilavatthu with the Buddha, his companions asked him why he so loved the forest, and he spoke a verse in praise of forest life (Thag.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he was a large tortoise living in the Vinatā.  Seeing the Buddha about to cross the river, he took him on his back.  Many hundreds of times afterwards he lived as an ascetic in the forest.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he became a dove, and his heart was gladdened by the sight of a monk practicing compassion.  Later he was born as a householder in Benares and renounced the world.  ThagA.i.58f.; Ap.ii.506f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vanavaccha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The son of a rich brahmin of Rājagaha; he joined the Order, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha's visit to Bimbisāra.  Soon after, he attained arahantship and, devoted to detachment, dwelt in the woods hence his name.  When he went to Rājagaha his kinsmen asked him to live near them, but he said he preferred the lonely life of the forest (Thag.113).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a labourer, and, having committed a crime, while fleeing from justice he saw a Bodhi tree.  Pleased with the look of the tree, he gathered masses of asoka flowers and heaped them up round the tree.  When his pursuers reached him, he remained as he was, looking at them, with no hatred in his heart.  They hurled him into a precipice, and he died with the thought of the Bodhi tree in his heart.  Three kappas ago he was a king named Santusita (ThagA.i.222).  He is perhaps identical with Tambapupphiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaddhakisūkara Jātaka (No.  283)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A carpenter of a village near Benares was once wandering in the forest, and having found a young boar in a pit, took him home and brought him up.  The boar was well mannered and helped the carpenter in his work, and so he came to be called Vaddhakisūkara ("Carpenter boar").  When he grew up, the carpenter took him back to the forest, and there he came across some boars who lived in mortal fear of a tiger.  The young boar drilled his army of boars, arranged them in battle array, and awaited the tiger.  When he arrived, the boars, under their leader's instructions, mimicked the tiger in all he did.  The tiger, thereupon, sought the advice of a false ascetic who shared his prey, and, following his counsel, made a leap at the boar leader and fell into a pit which had been dug for him.  There the boars attacked him and ate him, and those who were unable to get any of the flesh sniffed at the others' mouths to see how "tiger" tasted.  Then they set off after the false ascetic, and when he climbed a fig tree they dug it up and it fell to the ground.  The man was torn to pieces and his body licked clean.  The boars then placed their leader on the tree trunk, consecrated him king with water, which they fetched in the dead man's skull, and made a young sow his consort.  (This is how kings came to be consecrated with water from shells and seated on a throne of fig planks.) The Bodhisatta who was then a tree sprite sang the boar's praises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.), who was responsible for Pasenadi's victory over Ajātasattu.  J.ii.403ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsuladatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nāga of Mañjerikabhavana.  He was the nephew of Mahākāla, and when Sonuttara went to the Nāga world to obtain the Buddha's relics for the Mahā Thūpa, Mahākāla signed to Vāsuladatta to hide them.  Vāsuladatta assumed a huge Nāga form, three hundred leagues long, with a head one league in extent, and having swallowed the casket containing the relics, lay down at the foot of Sineru.  But Sonuttara, by his iddhi power, put his hand into the Nāga's stomach and removed the invisible relics.  Mhv.xxxi.52ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vārana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera.  He was born in a brahmin family of Kosala, and having heard a forest dwelling monk preach, entered the Order.  One day, when on his way to visit the Buddha, he saw a fight between snakes and mongooses, in which many of them perished.  Distressed by the sight of their hatred for each other, he sought the help of the Buddha, who preached to him three stanzas (Thag.237-9).  At the end of the recitation, Vārana developed insight and became an arahant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety two kappas ago he was born in the family of the brahmin Sumedha, and becoming expert in brahmin lore, he entered the ascetic life.  As he sat teaching hymns to his pupils there was an earthquake, marking the conception of Tissa Buddha.  People, in terror, sought the sage, who explained it to them, thereby himself experiencing great joy in contemplating the glory of the Buddha (ThagA.i.353f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Nimittivyākaranīya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.411f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Vararoja.&lt;/b&gt; Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.656) that the heretics once paid Vararoja one thousand to speak ill of the Buddha's person.  Vararoja went to see the Buddha and was struck by the perfection of every feature; he spoke the Buddha's praises in a verse of over one thousand lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsijata (or Nāvā) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The āsavas are destroyed only by self training, not by merely wishing for their destruction.  A hen may wish for her chicks to break through their eggs with foot, or claw, or mouth, or beak, but they will not do so till they are fully warmed, fully brooded over by the hen.  When they are ready to break through, they will do so, irrespective of the hen's wish.  A carpenter knows that his adze handle has worn away, not by looking at the finger marks on the handle, but just by its wearing away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seagoing vessel, stranded without water and beaten on by wind and sun, will fall to pieces easily and without effort.  So will the āsavas in a monk who dwells attentive to self training.  S.iii.152f.; cp.  A.iv.126f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsuladattā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;.  She was the daughter of Candappajjota.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pajjota heard that Udena's splendour surpassed his own, he resolved to capture him.  He was told that Udena could charm elephants with his magic lute, and had a wooden elephant made in which he placed sixty men.  A woodsman was sent to inform Udena of the new elephant which had appeared in the forest, and he set out to capture it.  The men inside the elephant caused it to run, and, in the course of the chase, Udena was separated from his retinue and taken captive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three days Pajjota feasted in celebration of his victory, and Udena asked him either to release him or order his death.  Pajjota promised release if Udena would teach him the elephant charm; but Udena would teach only to one who paid him homage as a teacher, and this Pajjota would not do.  Then Pajjota contrived that Udena should teach it to Vāsuladattā.  A curtain was hung between them, Udena was told that his pupil was a hunch backed woman of the court, while Udena was described to the princess as a leper who knew a priceless charm.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many days Udena tried to teach the charm, but the princess could not learn it.  In impatience, Udena said: "Dunce of a hunchback, thy lips are too thick and thy cheeks too fat; I've a mind to beat thy face in." And the princess replied: "Villain of a leper, what meanest thou by calling me hunchback?" Udena lifted the fringe of the curtain and they saw each other.  From that moment they planned to escape and marry.  There was no more learning of charms nor giving of lessons.  When their plans were complete, Vāsuladattā told her father that she needed a conveyance and the use of a gate in the city wall.  To work the charm, she explained, a certain herb was necessary, which must be obtained at night, at a time indicated by the stars.  Thus she secured the use of Pajjota's female elephant, Bhaddavatī, and permission to use a certain door at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one day, when Pajjota was out on pleasure, the two filled several bags with gold and silver coins and they started off on Bhaddavatī.  The harem guards gave the alarm and the king sent men in pursuit.  Udena opened first a sack of gold and then one of silver, scattering the coins, which delayed his pursuers, greedy for the coins.  He, meanwhile, hurried on and reached the stockade where his soldiers awaited him.  They conducted him and Vāsuladattā, to Kosambī, where she was made Udena's chief consort.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vanavāsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district, probably Northern Kanara, in South India.  After the Third Council, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rakkhita,Rakkhita')"&gt;Rakkhita&lt;/a&gt; Thera was sent there to convert the people, and he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anamatagga_sam,Anamatagga Samyutta')"&gt;Anamatagga Samyutta&lt;/a&gt; poised in mid air.

The Vanavāsī are mentioned in the Mahābhārata (6. 366) and the Harivamsa (5232) as a people of S.  India.

A jackal, who lived on their leavings, wishing to make them quarrel, told each that the other spoke evil of him.  The lion and tiger discovered his plot and he had to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a man who lived on the broken food of Sāriputta and Moggallāna and tried to set them at variance with each other.  The attempt failed and the man was driven away.  He is identified with the jackal.  J.iii.191ff.; cp.  the Sandhibheda Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vāsudeva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eldest of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa,Andhakavenhudāsaputtā')"&gt;Andhakavenhudāsaputtā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghata_jat_355_454,Ghata Jātaka')"&gt;Ghata Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (No.  454) relates how, when Vāsudeva's son died and Vāsudeva gave himself up to despair, his brother &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghata,Ghatapandita')"&gt;Ghatapandita&lt;/a&gt; brought him to his senses by feigning madness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vāsudeva's minister was Rohineyya.  Vāsudeva is addressed (J.iv.84; he is called Kanha at J.vi.421) as Kanha and again as Kesava.  The scholiast explains (J.iv.84) that he is called Kanha because he belonged to the Kanhāyanagotta, and Kesava because he had beautiful hair (kesasobhanatāya).  These names, however, give support to the theory (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa,Andhakavenhudāsaputtā')"&gt;Andhakavenhudāsaputtā&lt;/a&gt;, No.1) that the story of Vāsudeva was associated with the legend of Krsna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546,Mahāummagga Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāummagga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.421) it is stated that Jambāvatī, mother of King Sivi, was the consort of Vāsudeva Kanha.  The scholiast identifies this Vāsudeva with the eldest of the Andhakavenhudāsaputtā, and says that Jambāvatī was a candalī.  Vāsudeva fell in love with her because of her great beauty and married her in spite of her caste.  Their son was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sivi,Sivi')"&gt;Sivi&lt;/a&gt;, who later succeeded to his father's throne at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dvaaravatii,Dvāravatī')"&gt;Dvāravatī&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vāsudeva is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt;.  J.iv.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vāsudevavattikā.&lt;/b&gt; Probably followers of Vāsudeva (? Krsna); they are mentioned with Baladevavattikā and others in a list of samanabrāhmanāvattasuddhikā.  Nid.i.89; cf.  Vāsudevāytana at DhSA., p.141.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajirapāni&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that whoever, even up to the third time of being asked, refuses to answer a reasonable question put by a Buddha, his head will split into pieces on the spot.  It was Vajirapāni's duty to frighten such people by appearing before them in the sky, armed with a thunderbolt, which he was ready to hurl if necessary.  He was visible only to the Buddha and the person in question.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two instances of this are given in the books - once in the case of Ambattha, (D.i.95; cf.  the story in the Ayakūta Jātaka) and again in that of Saccaka Niganthaputta (M.i.231).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.264; MA.i.457; cp.  Dvy.130) that Vajirapāni is identical with Sakka, and proceeds to describe the fierce appearance assumed by him on these occasions.  This arrangement was made in fulfilment of a promise made by Sakka, in the presence of Mahā Brahmā, when the Buddha was reluctant to preach the Dhamma (See Vin.i.5f), that if the Buddha would establish his rule of the Dhamma (Dhammacakka), Sakka would afford it the necessary protection.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some places (E.g., Cv.xcvi.37; see also J.R.A.S.  1916, p.733f), Vajirapāni's conquest of the Asuras is alluded to, thus establishing his identity with Indra.  See also Vajirahattha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaddha (or Puppha) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha states that he has no quarrel with the world; the world quarrels with him.  He teaches only what is upheld by the world of sages and proceeds to describe what this teaching is.  Like a lotus which, though it arises and grows in the water, is yet unspotted by it, so a Tathāgata, arisen and grown in the world, is yet unspotted by it.  S.iii.138f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He is like a stone column sixteen cubits long, half of its length buried under the earth.  No wind can make it tremble.  S.v.445.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vālikārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Vesāli, where the question of the Ten Points raised by the Vajjiputta monks (q.v.) was settled (Vin.ii.306; Mhv.iv.  50, 63; according to Dpv.v.29 this was done in the Kutāgārasāla).

Valliya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the son of a Malla chieftain of Pāvā and joined the Order with his companions, Godhika, Subāhu and Uttiya, when they went on some embassy to Kapilavatthu and saw the Yamakapātihāriya in Nigrodhārāma.  Bimbisāra later built huts for them, but he forgot to roof them, and so there was no rain till the roofs were added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha, Valliya offered him a handful of flowers.  ThagA.i.123; his verse is included in the Thag.  (vs.  53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Valliya Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He was the son of an eminent brahmin of Sāvatthi, and, owing to his good friends, he met the Buddha and joined the Order, soon after attaining arahantship.  Thirty one kappas ago he saw the Pacceka Buddha Nārada at the foot of a tree, and built for him a hut of reeds, which he thatched with grass, together with a cloistered walk strewn with sand.  He was seventy one times king of the devas and thirty four times king of men.  ThagA.i.247; two verses in the Thag.  (125-6) are attributed to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Nalāgārika of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.278f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Valliya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a brahmin family of Vesāli, and was named Gandimitta (v.l.  Kanhamitta).  Much struck by the Buddha when he came to Vesāli, he joined the Order under Mahā Kaccāyana.  Because he was dull of insight and depended too much on his colleagues, he was called Valliya (creeper), like the ivy which must lean on something in order to grow.  Later, following the advice of Venudatta Thera, he developed insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a rich brahmin, well versed in learning.  Later, he renounced eighty crores of wealth, and, after becoming an ascetic, lived on a river bank.  There the Buddha visited him, and, seated on an antelope skin, preached the Doctrine.  The ascetic paid him great honour and gave him mangoes and perfume and flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apadāna verses, quoted in ThagA., it is said that Valliya was born in the city of Vebhāra, built by Vissakamma, and that he left the household at the age of five.  ThagA.i.292f.; two verses addressed by him to Venudatta are included in the Thag.  (167-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Candanamāliya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.423f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajjiputta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vajjiputta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to the family of a minister of Vesāli, and, seeing the majesty of the Buddha who visited the city, he joined the Order and lived in a wood near by.  A festival took place in Vesāli, with much singing and dancing and gaiety.  This distracted Vajjiputta, and he expressed his disgust in a verse spoken in scorn of the forest life.  A woodland sprite heard him and upbraided him, saying, "Though you spurn life in the forest, the wise, desiring solitude, think much of it," and she then uttered a verse praising it.  This verse, which the monk afterwards repeated, is included in Thag.vs.62. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged on by the sprite's words, Vajjiputta developed insight and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago he had been a householder and had paid homage to Vipassī Buddha, with pollen from nāga flowers.  Forty five kappas ago he was a king, named Renu.  ThagA.i.142f.  Vajjiputta's story is given very briefly in S.i.201f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vajjiputta's story is also given in the Dhammapada Commentary.  There he is called a rājā, and is said to have renounced his kingdom when his turn came to rule.  On the day of the festival, on the full moon day of Kattika, he was filled with discontent.  After his conversation with the woodland sprite, he sought the Buddha, who preached to him.  He attained arahantship at the end of the Buddha's sermon.  DhA.iii.460f.; see also SA.i.228, where also he is called rājā.  There may be some confusion between Vajjiputta (1) and (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be identified with Renupūjaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.146.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vajjiputta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a Licchavi rājā's family, and while still young, and learning various arts, such as training elephants, he was filled with the desire for renunciation.  One day he went to a vihāra where the Buddha was preaching, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, when the chief Elders were living in various places prior to their agreed meeting for the recital of the Dhamma, he saw Ananda, still a learner (sekha), teaching the Doctrine to a large assembly.  Wishing to urge him to higher attainment, Vajjiputta uttered a verse, and this verse was among those which led to Ananda's attainment of arahantship.  The verse is found in Thag.vs.119. In S.i.199 the verse is attributed to a forest deva who wished to agitate Ananda.  In Rockhill (op.  cit., 155f.), Vajjiputta was Ananda's attendant at the time and preached to the people while Ananda meditated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety four kappas ago, Vajjiputta had seen a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and had given him plantain fruits.  ThagA.i.236f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentioned with Bhañña in the compound Vassabhaññā, as dwellers of Ukkala and as "denying cause, consequence and reality." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were certain aspects of the Buddha's teaching which even they would accept (E.g., S.iii.73; A.ii.31; M.iii.78).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (AA.ii.497; MA.ii.894) Vassabhañña as "Vasso ca Bhañño cāti dve janā."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vappa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vappa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; One of the Pañcavaggiyā.  He was the son of Vāsettha, a brahmin of Kapilavatthu.  When Asita declared that Prince Siddhattha would become the Buddha, Vappa and four other brahmins, headed by Kondañña, became recluses.  Vappa was with the Buddha during the six years of his ascetic practices, but being disappointed when the Buddha began taking solid food, he left him and went to Isipatana, where the Buddha, after his Enlightenment, preached to him and the others the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.  On the fifth day after, Vappa and his companions became arahants, at the end of the Anattalakkhana Sutta.  Vappa became a sotāpanna on the second day of the quarter (AA.i.84); pātipadadivase, says ThagA.  (loc.  infra) and MA.i.390.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vappa's resolve to be among the first of the Buddha's followers was taken in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  In the past, he was sixteen times king, under the name of Mahādundubhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThagA.i.140f.; a verse attributed to him is found in Thag.61); see also J.i.82; Dpv.i.32; Vin.i.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vappa.  &lt;/b&gt; A Sākiyan, disciple of the Niganthas.* He visits Moggallāna and they talk of the āsavas.  The Buddha joins them and tells Vappa how the āsavas can be completely destroyed so that the monk who has so destroyed them will abide in the six satata vihāras with equanimity, mindful and comprehending.  Vappa is convinced of the superiority of the Buddha's teaching and becomes his follower.  A.ii.196f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* AA.ii.559 says he was the Buddha's uncle (cūlapitā) and a Sākiyan rājā.  He was a disciple of Nigantha Nātaputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Valāhakāyikādevā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of deities, spirits of the skies, divided into &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unhavalāhakā (cloud spirits of heat)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sītavalāhakā (cloud spirits of cold)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abbhavalāhakā (cloud spirits of air)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vātavalāhakā (cloud spirits of wind) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vassavalāhakā (cloud spirits of rain) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes of weather are due to these spirits.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vattagāmanī Abhaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (29 17 B.C.).  He was the son of Saddhātissa, and came to the throne by killing the usurper Mahārattaka (v.l.  Kammahārattaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He married Anulā, wife of Khallātanāga, and adopted Mahācūlika as his own son; because of this Vattagāmanī came to be known as Pitirājā (this name occurs several times in the Commentaries - e.g., VibhA.  passim, see Pitirājā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vattagāmanī had a second wife, Somadevī, and also a son of his own, called Coranāga.  In the fifth month of his reign a brahmin, named Tissa, rose against him, but was defeated by seven Damilas who landed at Mahātittha.  .  After that, the Damilas waged war against the king and defeated him at Kolambālaka.  It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattagāmainī, as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri (q.v.).  The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala Mahātissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanasīva.  In his flight he left Somadevī behind, and she was captured by the Damilas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fourteen years Vattagāmanī and his queen Anulā lived under the protection of Tanasīva, and, during this time, five Damilas ruled in succession at Anurādhapura; they were Pulahattha, Bāhiya, Panayamāra, Pilayamāra and Dāthika.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a time, Anulā quarrelled with Tanasīva's wife, and the king, in his resentment, killed Tanasīva.  Later, when he also killed Kapisīsa, his ministers left him in disgust, but were persuaded by Mahātissa to return.  When his preparations were complete, the king attacked Dāthika, slew him, and took the throne.  He then founded Abhayagiri-vihāra and recovered Somadevī.  He also built the Silāsobbhakandaka-cetiya.  He had seven ministers who themselves built several vihāras; among them Uttiya, Mūla, Sāliya, Pabbata and Tissa are mentioned by name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the reign of Vattagāmanī that the Buddhist Canon and its Commentaries were first reduced to writing in Ceylon, according to tradition, in Aloka vihāra.  For details of Vattagāmanī's reign see Dpv.xx.14ff.; Mhv.xxxiii.34ff.  The foundation of Abhayagiri vihāra formed the beginning of dissensions in the ranks of the monks (Cv.lxxiii.18).  Vattagāmani was, however, regarded by later generations as a great protector of the faith (Cv.lxxxii.23).  Various monasteries, chiefly rock temples, are traditionally ascribed to Vattagāmanī, and said to have been built by him during his exile; among these is the modern Dambulla vihāra.  The Cūlavamsa calls him the founder of the Majjhavela vihāra.  Cv.c.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassakāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vassakāra Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Vassakāra visits the Buddha at Veluvana and tells him that, among brahmins, a man is considered great and wise if &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;he understands a thing as soon as uttered, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;has a good memory, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;is skilled and diligent in business, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and resourceful and capable in investigation.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha mentions four other qualities of greatness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to be given up to the welfare of many, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to be master of the mind in the domain of thought (cetovasippatta), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to be able to enter into the four jhānas at will, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to have comprehended Nibbāna by the destruction of the āsavas.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha acknowledges, in answer to Vassakāra's question, that he himself possesses these four qualities.  A.ii.35f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vassakāra Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Vassakāra visits the Buddha at Veluvana and asks him a series of questions.  The Buddha, in answer, says that a bad man cannot, as a good man can, recognize either a good man or a bad man as such.  Vassakāra then relates how, once, the followers of the brahmin Todeyya spoke ill of Eleyya and his retinue for showing homage to Rāmaputta; he now understands why they honour Rāmaputta; it is because he is wiser than they.  A.ii.179f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vassakāra Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Vassakāra visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta, at the request of Ajātasattu, and tells him of the latter's desire to destroy the Vajjians.  The Buddha tells him that as long as the Vajjians practise the seven conditions of welfare, taught by him at Sārandada, cetiya they will not decline, but rather prosper.  Ajātasattu can achieve victory, not by battle, but by causing disunity.  A.iv.17ff.; cf.  D.ii.72f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassavuttha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk, who had spent the vassa at Sāvatthi with the Buddha, goes to Kapilavatthu, where he is visited by the Sākyans who wish to learn of the welfare of the Buddha and his disciples and of the teaching of the Buddha during the vassa.  The monk tells them of a statement made by the Buddha, to the effect that only few in the world become arahants, anāgāmīs, sakadāgāmīs or even sotāpannas.  S.v.405.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajjiputtakā, Vajjiputtiyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a large group of monks belonging to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajjian')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; clan and dwelling in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;, who, one century after the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; death, brought forward Ten Points (dasa vatthūni) as being permissible for members of the Order.  These points are as follows: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) The storing of salt in a horn (singilonakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) the eating of food when the shadow of the sun had passed two fingers' breadth beyond noon (duvangulakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) to eat once and then go again to the village for alms (gāmantarakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) the holding of the uposatha separately by monks dwelling in the same district (āvāsakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(5) the carrying out of an official act when the assembly is incomplete (anumatikappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(6) the following of a practice because it is so done by one's tutor or teacher (ācinnakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(7) the eating of sour milk by one who has already had his midday meal (amathitakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(8) the use of strong drink before it has fermented (jalogikappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(9) the use of a rug which is not of the proper size (nisīdanakappa); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(10) the use of gold and silver (jātarūparajatakappa).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orthodox monks refused to agree to these points, and one of their leaders, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa Kākandakaputta')"&gt;Yasa Kākandakaputta&lt;/a&gt;, publicly condemned the action of the Vajjiputtakas.  Yasa then left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, and, having summoned monks from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; in the west and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti,Avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; in the south, sought &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhuta,Sambhūta Sānavāsi')"&gt;Sambhūta Sānavāsi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ahogangaa,Ahoganga')"&gt;Ahoganga&lt;/a&gt;.  On his advice they sought &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata,Soreyya-Revata')"&gt;Soreyya-Revata&lt;/a&gt;, and together they consulted &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabbakama,Sabbakāmi')"&gt;Sabbakāmi&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaalikaaraama,Vālikārāma')"&gt;Vālikārāma&lt;/a&gt;.  In the Council that followed the Ten Points were declared invalid, and this decision was conveyed to the monks.  Soon after was held a recital of the Doctrine in which seven hundred monks took part under the leadership of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata,Soreyya-Revata')"&gt;Soreyya-Revata&lt;/a&gt;.  The recital lasted eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the Vajjiputtaka heresy is given in the twelfth chapter of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_vagga,Cullavagga')"&gt;Cullavagga&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.294ff.); the Mhv.iv.9ff.  gives more details in certain respects; see also Dpv.iv.48ff.; v.17ff.; 32ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that even during the Buddha's life five hundred monks, described as Vajjiputtakā, seceded from the Order and joined &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; though they were later brought back by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.199f.).  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; actually (Sp.i.228) identifies the heretics as belonging to the same party.  For the part played by Yasa Thera see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa (2).')"&gt;Yasa (2).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vajjiputtakas refused to accept the finding of Revata's Council and formed a separate sect, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasanghika,Mahāsanghikas')"&gt;Mahāsanghikas&lt;/a&gt;, numbering ten thousand monks, who held a recital of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vattabbaka Nigrodha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A famous Elder in the time of Pitirājā (Vattagāmanī).  He was a sāmanera, and, during the prevalence of the Brahmanatissabhaya (q.v.), looked after his teacher at the risk of his own life, once even climbing a palmyra tree in order to get him some nuts.  Later, feeling that the care of an old and feeble man was too much for him, his teacher advised him to go away alone.  The teacher was later eaten by cannibals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sāmanera became famous as a Tipitakadhara, and when the Tissabhaya had disappeared, monks came from overseas to visit him.  He thus became the leader of a large company, and once when he visited Anurādhapura, he received gifts of three robes in nine different places.  See VibhA.449f., where the story is given in great detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Valāhassa Jātaka (No.  196)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in Tambannidīpa, was a Yakkha-city called Sirīsavatthu, peopled by Yakkhinīs.  When shipwrecked sailors were cast on the shore from the River Kalyānī to Nāgadīpa, the yakkhinīs would assume human form and entice them and use them as their husbands.  On the arrival of other castaways, they would eat their former husbands and take the new arrivals as their lovers.  Once five hundred merchants were cast ashore there and became the husbands of the yakkhinīs.  In the night the yakkhinīs left them and ate their former husbands.  The eldest merchant discovered this and warned the others, but only half of them were willing to attempt an escape.  Now it happened that the Bodhisatta was a horse of the Valāhaka race and was flying through the air from the Himālaya to Tambapanni.  There, as he passed over the banks and fields, he asked in a human voice: "Who wants to go home?" and the two hundred and fifty traders begged to be taken.  They climbed on the horse's back and tail and he took them to their own country.  The others were eaten by the yakkhinīs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had become a backslider from running after a beautifully dressed woman.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vatamsaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha of the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man once offered a vatamsaka flower to the Buddha as he was begging for alms in Sāvatthi.  The Buddha accepted the gift and smiled.  When Ananda asked the reason for the smile, the Buddha replied that the man would enjoy bliss for eighty four kappas and would then become a Pacceka Buddha named Vatamsaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vacchagotta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vacchagotta.  &lt;/b&gt; A Paribbājaka, who later became an arahant Thera.  Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books.  For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā Vacchagotta-, Vaccha- and Vacchagotta-Suttas.  Some of these suttas are quoted in the Kathāvatthu (E.g., p.  267, 505).  The Samyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc.  S.iii.257ff.; see also S.iv.391ff., for several discussions of Vacchagotta with Moggallāna, Ananda and Sabhiya Kaccāna on similar topics.  The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta's conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta (No.  72) it is merely stated that "the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said." At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher.  In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months.  He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant's understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine.  The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā may be acquired.  Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant.  He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas (M.i.493 97).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā (vs.  112).  According to the Commentary (ThagA.i.221), he belonged to a rich brahmin family of the Vaccha clan (Vacchagotta).  His personal name is not given.  He became an expert in brahmin learning, but failing to find therein what he sought, he became a Paribbājaka, joining the Buddha's Order later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder of Bandhumatī, and one day, when the Buddha and his monks were invited to the king's palace, he swept the street along which the Buddha passed and set up a Rag as decoration.  As a result he was born, four kappas ago, as a rājā, Sudhaja by name.  He is probably identical with Vīthisammajjaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.177.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vacchagotta.&lt;/b&gt; A Paribbājaka.  He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāva (A.i.180f ) as visiting the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins.  He is possibly to be identified with Vacchagotta (1).  In this context, however, he is called Venāgapurika.  Vacchagotta (1) (q.v.) was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli (M.i.481), at Sāvatthi (M.i.483; S.iii.257), and at Ñātikā (S.iv.  401), in addition to his visits to Rājagaha (M.i.489).  The Commentary (AA.i.410), moreover, explains Venāgapuraka by "Venāgapuravāsī," which may mean that he merely lived at Venāgapura and was not necessarily a native of that place.  Vacchagotta's question was as to how the Buddha looked so shining and his colour so clear? Was it because he slept on a luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable, but from quite a different point of view.  At the end of the discourse, Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vacchagotta.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Kapilavatthu, father of Vanavaccha Thera (q.v.).  ThagA.i.58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vasabha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vasabha.  &lt;/b&gt; A householder of Kutumbiyangana and father of Velusumana.  Mhv.xxiii.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vasabha.  &lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (127 171 A.C.).  He was a Lambakanna of Uttarapassa and served under his uncle, the general of King Subha.  As it was declared by the soothsayers that one named Vasabha would be king, Subha ordered the slaughter of all bearing that name and Vasabha's uncle took him to the court to surrender him.  But the general's wife, Potthā, gave her husband betel without lime to take with him, and, on the way to the palace, Vasabha was sent back to fetch the lime.  There Potthā told him of the plot against his life, gave him one thousand pieces and helped him to escape.  When his plans were ready, he fought against Subha, killed both him and his uncle in battle and became king.  Potthā was made his queen.  Soothsayers told him that he would live only twelve years, and, after consultation with the monks, Vasabha did many acts of merit in order to prolong his life; he reigned for forty four years.  Among the buildings erected by him were the Mahāvalligotta vihāra, the Anurārāma vihāra and the Mucela vihāra.  He also built twelve tanks and raised the wall of Anurādhapura.  His son and successor was Vankannāsikattissa.  For details of Vasabha's reign and works, see Dpv.xxii.1ff.  and Mhv.xxxv.59ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DA.ii.635) that once Vasabha listened to Dīghabhānaka monks reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta in the Ambalatthika pāsāda, near Lohapāsāda, and applauded the Buddha's statement contained in the sutta that all things are transient.  On another occasion he went to the Katthakasālaparivena to worship an Elder named Mahāsatthivassa (this may be only a descriptive title), but as he approached the door of his cell, he heard the Elder's groans of pain, and, disappointed that he had not yet developed the power of suppressing pain even after sixty years of monastic life, the king turned away.  The Elder was told of this by his attendant, and, putting forth great effort, attained arahantship; he thereupon sent for the king.  The king lay at full length on the ground and worshipped him, saying, "It is not your arahantship I worship, but the Sīla you observed as a puthujjana." (DA.i.291)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another story is related of Vasabha, of how once, in order to test a monk, he sat near him and began to crush a jujube fruit.  The monk's mouth watered, and Vasabha knew that he was not an Arahant (MA.ii.869).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Vasabha's queen was ill, she was cured by medicines suggested by Mahāpaduma Thera.  Sp.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Varuna village.  His daughter gave milk rice to Piyadassī Buddha before his Enlightenment.  BuA.172.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vasabha.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the chief lay supporters of Nārada Buddha.  Bu.x.25; J.i.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vasabha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He belonged to a family of a Licchavi rājā of Vesāli and joined the Order when the Buddha visited that town, winning arahantship in due course.  According to the Apadāna verses quoted, he was born in Sāvatthi and was ordained under Sāriputta at the age of seven.  Out of compassion for his patrons, he enjoyed what he received from them; the common minded thereupon deemed him self indulgent.  Near him lived a fraudulent monk who deceived the people by pretending to live the simple life and was greatly honoured by them.  Sakka, discerning this, visited Vasabha and questioned him concerning the ways of an impostor.  The Elder replied in two verses (Thag.139 40), and Sakka then warned the impostor and departed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when the world was without a Buddha, Vasabha was a Jatila named Nārada on Samaggapabbata, with a retinue of fourteen thousand.  Seeing no one deserving of his worship, he made a cetiya of sand on the bank of the River Apadikā, in the name of the Buddhas, gilded it and offered it his homage.  Eighty times he was king of devas and three hundred times king of men (ThagA.i.257ff).  He is evidently to be identified with Pulinathūpiya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.437f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; Called Labhiya Vasabha.  One of the famous warriors of Dutthagāmanī.  He was called Labhiya because his body was noble in form, "straight like a stick (yatthi)." (MT.  459) When he was twenty years old, he started to build a tank with some friends, and he threw away masses of earth which would have needed ten or twelve ordinary men to move them.  Kākavannatissa heard of this and summoned him to the court.  The village irrigated by the tank was given to him, and it came to be called Vasabhodakavāra.  Mhv.xxiii.90ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; A mountain near Himavā.  ThagA.i.182; Ap.i.166.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Vasabha.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant Thera in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, declared foremost for austere practices (Ras.i.27).  The name is evidently a variant of Nisabha (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He belonged to a Licchavi rājā's family in Vesāli and was a devoted follower of the Buddha, delighting in waiting upon him and in making gifts to the monks.  Later, because of an offence he had committed, the Buddha passed on him the sentence of pattanikkujjana.  He was much grieved and begged the forgiveness of the Sangha, and, because of his agitation, he renounced the world and joined the Order.  But he was given up to sloth and torpor, till the Buddha admonished him in a verse*.  He then put forth effort and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This verse is found in the Thag.vs.40; elsewhere (Thag.vs.1162) this verse is ascribed to Moggallāna as having been spoken by him to a monk named Tissa and again repeated (vs.  1163) by him to Vaddhamāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably to be identified with Vaddha (1), though no mention is made of Vaddha having entered the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he had been a householder and had given the Buddha beautiful mango fruits.  ThagA.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vaddhamāna.  &lt;/b&gt; The capital of Ceylon (Varadīpa) in the time of Konāgamana Buddha.  Its king was Samiddha.

Vaddhamāna.&lt;/b&gt; A city (nagara) in Mahāgāma, over which Gāmani-Abhaya (afterwards Dutthagāmani) was appointed chief soon after his birth (MT.  443).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story is related (AA.ii.522) of a hunter of Vaddhamāna who, in the name of his dead kinsman, gave alms to a wicked monk.  Three times he did this, till the spirit of the peta cried out against it.  He then gave alms to a good monk.  The peta benefited by his gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vaddhamāna.&lt;/b&gt; The name of a Bodhi tree in Ceylon.  Attached to it was a temple, restored by Aggabodhi IV.  (Cv.xlviii.5) and again by Udaya V.  (Cv.xlix.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vaddhamāna.&lt;/b&gt; A palace to be occupied by the future Buddha Meteyya.  Anāgat.  vs.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

Vatamsakiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant, probably identical with Abhaya Thera; see Abhaya (1).  Ap.i.174.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vatamsakiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  Thirty one kappas ago, while riding on an elephant, he saw Sikhī Buddha and offered him a vatamsakaflower.  Twenty seven kappas ago he became king under the name of Mahāpatāpa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaggamudātīriyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monks who lived on the banks of the Vaggumudā, evidently distinct from Yasoja (q.v.) and his companions.  When there was scarcity of food in the Vajji country these monks went about praising each other's superhuman qualities so that the laymen, deceived by their pretensions, kept them in great luxury.  When the Buddha discovered this, he rebuked them strongly and laid down the rules concerning the fourth Pārājikā offence.  Vin.iii.87ff.; Sp.ii.481ff.; DhA.iii.480.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vammīka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deity appeared before &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa,Kumārakassapa')"&gt;Kumārakassapa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana,Andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt; and propounded a riddle: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an anthill burning day and night.  The brahmin said: 'Take your tool, Sumedha (sage), and dig.' As the brahmin dug, he came across, successively, a bar, a frog, a forked passage, a strainer, a tortoise, a cleaver, a joint of meat - all of which he was told to cast out and dig on.  He then came across a cobra, which he was asked not to harm, but to worship." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the suggestion of the deity, Kassapa related the story to the Buddha, who solved the riddle.  The anthill is the body, the brahmin the arahant, the tool wisdom, digging perseverance, the bar ignorance, the forked passage doubting, the strainer the five &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/niivarana,nīvaranas')"&gt;nīvaranas&lt;/a&gt;, the tortoise the fivefold &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/upaadaana,upādāna')"&gt;upādāna&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/khandha,kkhandhas')"&gt;kkhandhas&lt;/a&gt;, the cleaver the fivefold pleasures of sense, the joint of meat passion's delights (nandīrāga), and the cobra (nāga) the arahant monk (M.i.142ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (MA.i.340), Kumārakassapa was not an arahant at the time of the preaching of the sutta.  The deity was a deity of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhaavaasaa,Suddhāvāsa')"&gt;Suddhāvāsa&lt;/a&gt; brahma world.  He was one of five friends who, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, had entered the Order and who, in order to meditate uninterruptedly, had climbed a rock by means of a ladder which they had then removed, thus cutting off their return.  The eldest became an arahant in three days, the second (anuthera) was this deity, who had become an anāgāmī.  The third was Pukkusāti, the fourth Bāhiya Dārucīriya and the last Kumārakassapa.  This deity was responsible for the arahantship both of Bāhiya and Kassapa, for Kassapa took the Vammīka Sutta as the subject of his meditations and thus developed insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vallabhā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A South Indian tribe.  Their ruler is described in the Chronicles simply as the Vallabha.  Mānavamma once joined Narasīha against the Vallabha king and defeated him (Cv.xlvii.15ff).  On another occasion, the Vallabha king sent a force to subdue Nāgadīpa in the reign of Mahinda IV.  The latter sent an army under the general Sena, defeated the Vallabhas and made a friendly treaty with them.  Cv.liv.12ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassakāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, chief minister of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt;.  He and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sunidha,Sunidha')"&gt;Sunidha&lt;/a&gt; were in charge of the fortifications of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaligāma')"&gt;Pātaligāma&lt;/a&gt;, built against the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajjī')"&gt;Vajjī&lt;/a&gt;.  (Vin.i.228; Ud.viii.6; the Dīgha account, D.ii.72ff.  omits Sunidha.  The Vinaya account omits Vassakāra's questions to the Buddha; cf.  AA.ii.705ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Ajātasattu's suggestion, Vassakāra visited the Buddha to discover, indirectly, whether, in the Buddha's view, there were any chances of Ajātasattu conquering the Vajjians in battle.  The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline, and this gave Vassakāra the idea that the downfall of the Vajjians could be brought about by diplomacy (upalāpana) or disunion (mithubheda).  He thereupon conspired with the king (D.A.ii.522ff ) and, by agreement, the latter expelled him on the charge of showing favour to the Vajjians during discussions in the assembly.  Vassakāra then went to the Vajjian country, and the Licchavis, all unsuspecting, welcomed him and appointed him as the teacher of their children.  By means of cunning and questioning the children in secret, he made them quarrel with each other, and these quarrels soon spread to the elders.  In three years the Licchavis were completely disunited, and when the assembly drum was beaten, they failed to appear.  Vassakāra then sent a message to Ajātasattu, who was able to capture Vesāli without meeting any resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaka_mogga,Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta')"&gt;Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.8ff), Vassakāra is represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna was holding with Ananda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, which were in charge of Moggallāna.  Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Sangha after the Buddha's death.  Ananda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight.  Vassakāra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present.  Vassakāra asks Ananda where he lives, and is told, in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;.  Vassakāra thinks this a good place for the practice of jhāna, and tells Ananda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding jhāna.  Ananda, remarks that all jhānas are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.854) that Vassakāra knew well of Ananda's residence at Veluvana, but that as the place was under his special protection, he wished to hear his work praised.  Then follows a curious tale.  Vassakāra once saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā Kaccāna')"&gt;Mahā Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; descending&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta,Gijjhakūta')"&gt;Gijjhakūta&lt;/a&gt; and remarked that he was just like a monkey.  The Buddha, hearing of this, said that, unless Vassakāra begged the Elder's forgiveness, he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana.  Vassakāra, feeling sure that the Buddha's prophecy would come true, had various fruit and other trees planted in Veluvana, to be of use to him as a monkey.  After death he was actually reborn as a monkey and answered to the name of Vassakāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veluvana.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara_sutta,Vassakāra Suttas')"&gt;Vassakāra Suttas&lt;/a&gt; (1) and (2), and Suta Sutta ??.  Another Sutta, also called Vassakāra (3), repeats the conversation recorded in the Dīgha regarding the possibility of Ajātasattu defeating the Vajjians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vassakāra had a daughter whom he wished to give in marriage to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttara,Uttara')"&gt;Uttara&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter refused the proposal as he wished to join the Order.  Vassakāra was angry, and contrived to take his revenge even after Uttara had become a monk (ThagA.i.240; see Uttara).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.ii.295) that Vassakāra was envious by nature, and, on discovering that a certain forest official had given tribute to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhaniya,Dhaniya')"&gt;Dhaniya&lt;/a&gt; (2) without the king's special leave, he reported the man to the king and had him punished (The incident is repeated at Vin.iii.42ff).  In this context we find that Vassakāra was Mahāmatta (? prime minister) to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Vānarinda Jātaka (No.  57)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey living on a river bank.  On his way from one bank to another, he used to jump off and on a rock in midstream, and a female crocodile, living in the river, longed to eat his heart and asked her husband to get it.  So the crocodile lay on the rock, ready to catch the monkey as he jumped.  The monkey noticing that, in spite of there being no tide, the rock was higher than usual, spoke to it and received no reply.  His suspicions were then confirmed, and he said again, "O rock, why don't you talk to me today ?" The crocodile then revealed both his identity and his purpose, and the monkey resolved to outwit him.  So he asked him to open his mouth, knowing that when a crocodile does this he shuts his eyes.  So the crocodile did this, and the monkey jumped on to its back and from there to the other bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempt to kill the Buddha.  J.i.278f.; cp.  Kumbhīla Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vālodaka Jātaka (No.  183)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Brahmadatta, king of Benares, went with a large army to quell a frontier rebellion, and, on his return, ordered that his horses be given some grape juice to drink.  The horses drank and stood quietly in their stalls.  There was a heap of leavings empty of all goodness, and the king ordered that these be kneaded with water, strained, and given to the donkeys who carried the horses' provender.  The donkeys drank it, and galloped about braying loudly.  The king asked his courtier (the Bodhisatta) the reason for this, and he answered that the lowborn lack self control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to some boys, attendants of devotees, at Sāvatthi.  The devotees themselves were calm and collected, but the boys would eat and then scamper about the banks of the Aciravatī, making great uproar.  They are identified with the donkeys (J.ii.95f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.154f ) the story was related after the monks returned to Sāvatthi from Verañjā.  Their attendants had been quiet in Verañjā, where there was little to eat, but in Sāvatthi they ate the remnants of the monks' food and made a great noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vassavalāhakā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Valāhaka devas (q.v.).  See also Pajjuna.  One of them once visited an arahant Thera in the Himālaya, and, revealing his identity, said that he could cause rain at will.  The Elder wished to test this claim, but even before he could enter his hut the deva sang a song, raised his hand, and rain fell to a distance of three leagues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are causes for rain: the power of nāgas, of supannas, of devas, of an Act of Truth, of change of weather, of Māra, and of iddhi power.  SA.ii.255f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vatthūpama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seventh sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya (M.i.36ff).  The Buddha says that, even as a dirty piece of cloth takes dyes badly, so in an impure heart bliss is not to be found.  He then proceeds to enumerate the heart's impurities and to show how they can be cleansed.  Sundarika Bhāradvāja, who is present, asks the Buddha if he has bathed in the Bāhukā.  The Buddha then gives a list of places whose waters are considered holy, and declares that the real cleansing is the cleansing of the heart "to love all that lives, speak truth, slay not nor steal, no niggard be but dwell in faith." Bhāradvāja seeks ordination and becomes an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently this sutta which is referred to in the Sumangalavilāsinī (DA.i.50, 123), as the Vattha Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajirakumārī, Vajirā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When peace was established between Pasenadi and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt;, Pasenadi gave Vajirā in marriage to Ajātasattu, and gave, as part of her dowry, the village in Kāsi which had been the cause of their quarrel (J.ii.404; iv.  343; DhA.iii.266).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta,Piyajātika Sutta')"&gt;Piyajātika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.110) she is called Vajirī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was Pasenadi's only daughter.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vatapada or Devā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells the monks of seven rules of conduct, the observance of which won for Sakka his celestial sovereignty.  There are the maintenance of parents, reverence for the head of the family, the use of gentle language, avoidance of slander, delight in renunciation, generosity and amiability, the speaking of truth and avoidance of anger.  S.i.228.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Vaddhī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; An Ariyan woman disciple increases in five things: faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom.  S.iv.250= A.iii.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vaddhī Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The same as Sutta (1), but as applied to a man.  A.iii.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vaddhī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Ariyan (disciple grows in ten ways: in lands and fields, wealth and possessions, wife and family, servitors and retinue, beasts of burden, faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vajjiyamāhita&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder of Campā, a devout and skilled follower of the Buddha.  Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggarā Lake, he found he had arrived too early and went into the Paribbājakārāma near by.  The Paribbājakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of asceticism and austerity.  They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist (venayika) and a visionary (? appaññattika).  (For explanation of these terms, see AA.ii.854).  Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved.  Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation.  The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged.  When Vajjiyamāhita had left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other persuasions.  A.v.189ff.; see also A.iii.451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaggumudā&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river in the Vajji country (v.l.

Because of his generosity and virtue practised in past births, he surpasses the devas of his world in ten things: divine life, beauty, happiness, pomp and power, divine shapes, sounds, perfumes, tastes and touch (A.iv.243).  Māra also rules over a part of this world, but more as a recalcitrant vassal.  MA.i.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vasavattī.&lt;/b&gt; An epithet of Mahā Brahmā: "Sabbam janam vase vattemī." DA.i.111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vasavattī.&lt;/b&gt; King of Pupphavatī, father of Candakumāra.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vannupatha Jātaka (No.  2)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a caravan of five hundred carts.  One night, while crossing a desert of sixty leagues, in the last stage of a journey, the pilot fell asleep and the oxen turned round.  All the wood and water was finished, but the Bodhisatta made the men dig a well.  After digging sixty cubits down they came upon a rock.  The men were filled with despair, but the Bodhisatta had the rock broken through by a serving lad who still showed courage and thus obtained water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related about a young man of Sāvatthi who entered the Order and practiced meditation, but was unable to attain insight.  He was filled with despair and his companions took him to the Buddha.  He is identified with the serving lad of the story.  J.i.106-110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vankahāra, Vangahāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district in India, the birthplace of the Therī Cāpā.  ThigA.220; but see SNA.i.259, where the janapada is called Vanga, not Vankahāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably to the south of Magadha (Sisters.132f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upaka lived there for some time, first as an Ajīvaka and later as Cāpā's husband.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place is said to have been infested with fierce flies.

Vanijjā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha explains to Sāriputta, in answer to his question, why it is that some people succeed in their trade and others do not, while in the case of yet others they prosper even beyond their hopes.  A.ii.81f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vanijjā Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The five trades which should not be plied by a lay devotee: trade in weapons, human beings, flesh, spirits, poisons.

She was the mother of Hatthipāla (the Bodhisatta), and is identified with Mahāmāyā.  J.iv.483, 491.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vāsetthī Theri.  &lt;/b&gt; She was born in Vesāli, and after being happily married bore a son.  The child died very young, and his mother was mad with grief.  One day she ran away from home, and, in the course of her wanderings, came to Mithilā, where she saw the Buddha, who calmed her grief.  He taught her the Doctrine and had her ordained at her own request.  She soon after became an arahant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of her child's death and her subsequent history, are contained in Thig.vs.133 8; see also ThigA.124f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said* that the brahmin Sujāta, father of Sundarī (q.v.), met Vāsetthī (probably in Benares), and, hearing her story, himself sought the Buddha at Mithilā where he joined the Order, becoming an arahant at the end of three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Thig.  312-24; ThigA.228f; according to Thig.312 Vāsetthī would seem to have lost "seven children," but the Commentary explains this as a rhetorical phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaddhamātā Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant, mother of Vaddha Thera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the birth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaddha,Vaddha')"&gt;Vaddha&lt;/a&gt; she heard a monk preach, joined the Order, and became an arahant.  She rebuked Vaddha when he visited her alone and without his cloak, and, later, when he asked for her advice, gave it to him and encouraged him.  Then Vaddha developed insight and became an arahant.  ThigA.171f.; her conversation with Vaddha and his declaration to her after becoming an arahant are included in the Thig.vs.204-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Vatthu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha declares, in answer to a deva's question, that children are a man's support, wife his supreme comrade, and the spirits of the rain sustain all earthbound creatures.  S.i.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vatthu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Two suttas, one of the ten causes of malice (āghāta), and the other on the ten remedies for the same.

A spider used to weave his web around them, crack their heads and drink their blood.  The Kinnaras sought Vaccha's assistance, but Vaccha refused to kill the spider, till tempted by the offer of a Kinnara maiden named Rathavatī as his servant.  Vaccha killed the spider and lived with Rathavatī as his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was among those related by Mahosadha's parrot Māthara to the mynah bird of the Pañcāla king's palace, to show her that in love there is no unlikeness - a man may well mate with a Kinnari, a parrot with a mynah.  J.vi.422.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vaccha.  &lt;/b&gt; See Kisavaecha, Nandavaccha, Pilindavaccha, Tirītavaccha, Vacchagotta, etc.  Also Ukkhepakatavaocha and the two Vanavacchas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaka Jātaka (No.  300)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wolf once lived on a rock near the Ganges.  The winter floods came and surrounded the rock, and the wolf, unable to escape, decided to keep the holy day.  The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, appeared before him in the guise of a he goat, and the wolf, forgetting his holy day, chased him round and round the rock.  Finding he could not succeed in catching him, the wolf expressed his joy that his holy day had not been violated! Sakka, hovering above him, rebuked him for his weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some monks, followers of Upasena (Vangantaputta) (q.v.).  Being aware of the permission granted by the Buddha to the monks who practiced the thirteen dhutahgas to visit him even during his periods of solitude, these monks would practice them for a short while and then visit him.  But, the visit over, they would at once throw off their rag robes and don other garments.  The Buddha discovered this and related the Jātaka.  J.ii.449ff.; cp.  Vin.iii.231f., where no mention is made of the Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vattaka Jātaka &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vattaka Jātaka (No.  35).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once born as a quail, and before he was old enough to fly, fire broke out in the forest wherein his nest was.  Seeing no means of escape, he made an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), calling to mind the holiness of the Buddhas and their doctrines.  The fire retreated to a distance of sixteen lengths and then extinguished itself.  The story was related in reference to a fire which broke out in the jungle when the Buddha was travelling in Magadha with a large company of monks.  Some of the monks were frightened and suggested various methods for putting out the fire, while others said they should seek the Buddha's protection.  This they did and the Buddha took them to a certain spot, where he halted.  The flames came no nearer than sixteen lengths from where they were standing, and in approaching the spot extinguished themselves.  When the monks marvelled at the great power of the Buddha, he told them the story of the past and said that, owing to his Act of Truth as a quail, that spot would never be harmed by flames during the whole of this kappa.  J.i.212ff.; cp.i.172.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vattaka Jātaka (No.  118).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once born as a quail, and was caught by a fowler who sold birds after fattening them.  The Bodhisatta, knowing this, starved himself, and when the fowler took him out of the cage to examine his condition the quail flew away and rejoined his companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a young man of Sāvatthi called Uttarasetthiputta.  He had descended from the Brahma world and had no desire for women.  Once, during the Kattika festival, his friends sent him a gaily decked woman to entice him, but he gave her some money and sent her away.  As she came out of his house, a nobleman saw her and took her with him.  When she failed to return, her mother complained to the king, and the setthiputta was told to restore her.  On failing to do so, he was taken off for execution.  He resolved that if by any means he could escape execution he would become a monk.  The girl noticed the crowd following the young man, and on learning the reason she revealed her identity and he was set free.  He, thereupon, joined the Order and soon after became an arahant.  J.i.432ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vattaka Jātaka (No.  394).&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta was once a forest quail living on rough grass and seeds.  A greedy crow of Benares, who was in the forest, saw the quail and thought that the good condition of his body was due to rich food.  The quail, seeing the crow, talked to him, and then the crow discovered that the quail had a beautiful body not because he ate rich food, but because he had contentment of mind and freedom from fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a greedy monk who is identified with the crow.  J.iii.312f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vattaka Jātaka.&lt;/b&gt; See also the Sammodamāna Jātaka, which is evidently also referred to as the Vattaka Jātaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vacchagotta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Paribbājaka Vacchagotta asks the Buddha if it be true that the Buddha discourages the giving of alms to other than his own followers.  The Buddha says that, in his eyes, even pot scorings or dregs from cups thrown into a pool or cesspool, to feed the creatures living there, would be a source of merit.  But gifts made to the good are more fruitful than those made to the wicked.  The good are those who have abandoned lust, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and-flurry and doubt and wavering.

When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; asked for a Sākiyan girl in marriage, she was given to him.  Mahā-nāma went through the pretence of eating with her in order to allay Pasenadi's suspicions.  It is said (J.iv.145) that Mahā-nāma sat down to eat with her, but that as he was about to take the first mouthful, a messenger arrived, as prearranged, and brought him an urgent letter.  He, thereupon, left the food uneaten in order to read the letter, and asked Vāsabhakkhattiyā to finish her meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha,Vidūdabha')"&gt;Vidūdabha&lt;/a&gt; was the son ofVāsabhakkhattiyā.  It was this deceit practised on Pasenadi which made Vidūdabha take his revenge on the Sākiyans (DhA.i.345 f; J.iv.145f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that when Pasenadi discovered Vāsabhakkhattiyā's servile origin, he degraded both her and her son from their rank, and that they never went outside the palace (J.i.133f.; iv.148; aft also M.ii.110, where she is called Vāsabhā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha heard of this, he visited the king, preached to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthahaari_jak_7,Katthahāri Jātaka')"&gt;Katthahāri Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, and had the queen restored to honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

It was one of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"&gt;Mahājanapadas&lt;/a&gt;.  The inhabitants appear to have consisted of several confederate clans of whom the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavī')"&gt;Licchavī&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videhā')"&gt;Videhā&lt;/a&gt; were the chief.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passage in the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.519) - which states that among those responsible for the administration of justice in the Vajji country (see Licchavī) were the Atthakulakā - has given rise to the conjecture that Atthakulakā meant heads of eight clans composing the Vajjian confederacy.  There is no other evidence regarding the number of the clans.  The Atthakulakā were probably a judicial committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on the Licchavī became the most powerful of these clans (Licchavī Vajjiratthavāsīhi pasatthā) (E.g., MA.i.394), and the names Vajjī and Licchavī were often synonymous.  See Licchavī; in the Trikandasesa, quoted by Cunningham (AGI.  509), Licchavi, Vaideha and Tirabhukti were synonymous.  In one passage (A.iii.76) the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, "These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians" (bhavissanti Yajjī).  This probably only means that there was great hope of these young men becoming true Vaijians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the Buddha, conditions which ensured their prosperity.  But see G.  S.iii.62, n.1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of the Licchavis and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa,Mithilā')"&gt;Mithilā&lt;/a&gt; of the Videhas.  In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community.  The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarandada,Sārandada Cetiya')"&gt;Sārandada Cetiya&lt;/a&gt;.  The details of this teaching, and various other matters connected with the Vajji, are given under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavī')"&gt;Licchavī&lt;/a&gt;.  But soon after the Buddha's death, (three years after the Buddha's last visit to Vesāli, according to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, DA.ii.522) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of his minister &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vassakaara,Vassakāra')"&gt;Vassakāra&lt;/a&gt;, sowed dissension among the Vajjians and conquered their territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa,Malla')"&gt;Malla&lt;/a&gt;, Vajji, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi,Kāsi')"&gt;Kāsi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, and thus back (See, e.g., S.v.348), and he preached to the people, mostly in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa,Kūtāgārasālā')"&gt;Kūtāgārasālā&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;.  Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkaacelaa,Ukkācelā')"&gt;Ukkācelā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotigaama,Kotigāma')"&gt;Kotigāma&lt;/a&gt; (see, e.g., J.ii.232, where it is called a village of the Vajjians, on the Ganges), Nādikā (in which were Giñjakāvasatha and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gosingasaala,Gosingasālavana')"&gt;Gosingasālavana&lt;/a&gt;), Beluvagāma (or Veluvagāma), Bhandagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma.  Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, is also mentioned as a village of the Vajjians (S.iv.59).  The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian territory (Ud.iii.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one context (UdA., p.  382) Dhammapāla describes Udena as Vajjirājā.  This is probably a mistake, for nowhere is Udena, who was king of the Vatsas (or Vamsas), called the king of the Vajjis.  The Vajjī are mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544,Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka')"&gt;Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  It is significant that the first great schism in the Buddhist Order arose in Vajji, when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa,Vajjiputtakā')"&gt;Vajjiputtakā&lt;/a&gt; brought forward their Ten Points.  Even during the Buddha's lifetime some monks of Vajji joined &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.199f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt;, (Beal: op.  cit., 77) who visited it, the Vajji (Vriji) country was broad from east to west and narrow from north to south.  The people of the neighbouring countries were called Samvajji, or United Vajjis.  For details see Cunningham, AGI.  512ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the name Vajjī.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavī')"&gt;Licchavī&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Valabhāmukha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sea (samudda), the last of those seen by Suppāraka on his voyage.  Here the water is sucked away and rises on every side, leaving in the centre what looks like a deep pit.  Suppāraka, by an Act of Truth, prevented his ship from being sunk there (see the Suppāraka Jātaka).  It is also called Valabhāmukhī.  J.iv.142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Varana Jātaka (No.  71)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a teacher of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;, with five hundred brahmin pupils.  One day he sent the pupils into a forest to gather wood, but one of them was lazy and went to sleep, and when his companions woke him he climbed on to a tree and broke off some green branches.  One of the boughs hit him in the eye and wounded him.  The next day the pupils had been invited to a meal in a distant village and a servant girl was told to make them some gruel early, before their start.  She lit a fire with the green wood which lay on the top of the firewood, and the fire would not burn.  The green wood had been thrown there last by the lazy pupil who had been the last to return.  The pupils could not start in time and the journey had to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutumbiyaputta,Kutumbikaputta Tissa')"&gt;Kutumbikaputta Tissa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the brahmin youth is identified.

Vipula, across the Ketumatī River, through Mount Nālika and the Mucalinda Lake (Cyp.i.9; J.vi.514, 518, 519).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessantara and his family lived there in a hermitage built by Vissakimma at Sakka's suggestion (J.vi.520).  Sañjaya later built a road, eight usabhas wide, from Jetuttara to Vanka.  J.vi.580.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Varavāranā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of long lived deities.  Hearing that the Buddha was to be born, they started to make garlands to put on him on the day of his birth, but even on the day of his death these garlands were not finished, because, according to their computation, the time had passed so quickly.  When they heard that the Buddha was about to die, they brought the unfinished garlands, but could not get anywhere within the Cakkavāla.  They therefore remained in the sky, singing the praises of the Buddha.  DA.ii.576f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māgandiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Māgandiya.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of the Kuru country.  He had a very beautiful daughter, called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa,Māgandiyā')"&gt;Māgandiyā&lt;/a&gt;.  Many men of high station sought her hand, but the brahmin did not consider them worthy.  The Buddha, one day, became aware that both Māgandiya and his wife were ready for conversion, so he visited their village.  Māgandiya saw him, and, noting the auspicious marks on his body, told him of his daughter and begged him to wait till she could be brought.  The Buddha said nothing, and Māgandiya went home and returned with his wife and daughter arrayed in all splendours.  On arriving, they found the Buddha had gone, but his footprint was visible, and Māgandiya's wife, skilled in such matters, said that the owner of such a footprint was free from all passion.  But Māgandiya paid no attention, and, going a little way, saw the Buddha and offered him his daughter.  The Buddha thereupon told them of his past life, his renunciation of the world, his conquest of Māra, and the unsuccessful attempts of Māra's very beautiful daughters to tempt him.  Compared with them, Māgandiya was, he said, a corpse, filled with thirty two impurities, an impure vessel painted without; he would not touch her with his foot.  At the end of the discourse, Māgandiya and his wife became anāgāmins.  DhA.iii.193ff.; SNA.ii.542f.; cp.  Dvy.515ff., where the name is given as Mākandika and he is called a parivrājaka.  The daughter's name is given as Anūpamā and the wife's Sākalī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that they gave their daughter into the charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya, retired&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;from the world, and became arahants.  DhA.i.202&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.235f), Māgandiya's village was Kammāsadamma, and the Buddha went there on his journey to Kosambī at the invitation of Ghosita, Kukkuta and Pāvārika.  He turned off the main road to visit Māgandiya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Māgandiya (2), Māgandiya Sutta, and Māgandiyapañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Māgandiya.&lt;/b&gt; A Paribbājaka.  The Buddha was once staying in the fire hut of the brahmin Bhāradvājaggotta at Kammāsadamma and Māgandiya came to the hut.  Seeing the grass mat on which the Buddha slept at night, he inquired whose it was, and, on being told, he was very annoyed, calling the Buddha a rigid repressionist (bhunahu).  Bhāradvāja protested, whereupon Māgandiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha's face.  The Buddha, aware of this conversation, entered the hut in the evening and had a discussion with Māgandiya, who ended by joining the Order, later becoming an arahant.  M.i.502ff.; Mil.313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.681) that this Māgandiya was the nephew of Māgandiya (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The ruler of the province of Malaya in the time of Aggabodhi IV.  built a relic house for the cetiya there (Cv.xlvi.29), while Sena II.  gave to it several maintenance villages (Cv.Ii.75) and Vijayabāhu I.  restored it (Cv.lx.58).  It was while living there that Gajabāhu made his peace with Parakkamabāhu I.  and set up an inscription to that effect in the vihāra (Cv.lxxi.3; for its identification see Cv.Trs.i.100, n.  3.).  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maccha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, during a tour in Kosala with a large number of monks, the Buddha saw a fisherman selling fish.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting down at the foot of a tree by the wayside, the Buddha pointed out to the monks how no fisherman enjoyed a happy life because his mind was, for ever engaged in slaughter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the same, he said, with those who killed other creatures; those guilty of killing would suffer greatly after death.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahejjāghara&lt;/b&gt;, Mahejjāgharavatthu, Mahejjāgharāsanasālā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building in Anurādhapura, near the west gate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grounds of the building were laid out by Pandukābhaya (Mhv.x.90; xvii.30).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gajabāhu I.  first erected the Mahejjāsanasālā (Mhv.xxxv.122).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.378) explains that Mahejavatthu is a shrine (devatthāna) dedicated to the Yakkha Maheja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

When Alavaka threatened the Buddha he stood with his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsa (SNA.i.223).  Manosilātala was near Anotatta, and those who bathed in the lake dried and robed themselves there (E.g., J.i.232; iii.379).  It was also a resort of lions (J.ii.65) and was sixty leagues in extent (J.ii.92, 219).  Above it was the Kañcanaguhā (J.v.392) and below it the Kālapabbata.  J.vi.265.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Trs.i.16, n.2.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building was twenty five cubits high; Dhātusena removed it and replaced it by a building twenty one cubits high (Cv.xxxviii.52).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was restored by Mahānāga (Cv.xli.100), while Dāthopatissa II.  gave to it the village of Kesagāma (Cv.xlv.28).  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māgandiyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiya,Māgandiya')"&gt;Māgandiya&lt;/a&gt;.  When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; rejected her father's offer of marriage with her, her parents joined the Order, giving her in charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya.  The latter took her to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, who made her his chief consort, giving her five hundred ladies in waiting.  Māgandiyā was incensed against the Buddha for having called her a "vessel of filth," and, when he came to Kosambī, she planned her revenge.  Having discovered that Udena's other queen, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Sāmāvatī')"&gt;Sāmāvatī&lt;/a&gt;, and her companions were in the habit of watching for the Buddha through windows in the walls of their rooms, she told the king that Sāmāvatī and her friends were conspiring to kill him.  For some time the king refused to believe this, but when the holes were shown to him, he had them closed up and the windows built higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan having failed, Māgandiyā hired a slave to revile and abuse the Buddha in the streets.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; suggested to the Buddha that they should go elsewhere.  The Buddha answered, "I am like the elephant who has entered the fray, I must endure the darts that come upon me.  After seven days the abuse ceased.  Māgandiyā then persuaded her uncle to send eight live cocks to the palace and sent a page with them to the king's drinking place.  When the king asked what should be done with them, she suggested that Sāmāvatī and her friends should be asked to cook them for him.  This the king agreed to do, but the women refused to deprive an animal of its life.  Māgandiyā said they should be tested, and sent word by the page that the cocks were to be cooked for the Buddha.  The page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and Sāmāvatī and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha.  But even then the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of Sāmāvatī's disloyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māgandiyā then obtained a snake from her uncle with its fangs removed.  This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers.  Udena was in the habit of spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts.  When he announced his intention of going to Sāmāvatī, Māgandiyā begged of him not to go, saying she had had a dream and feared for his safety.  But the king went and Māgandiyā went with him.  As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow.  Māgandiyā screamed and accused Sāmāvatī of designs on the king's life.  This time Udena believed her, and placing Sāmāvati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at Sāmāvatī's breast.  But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce her.  Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave her a boon.  She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ananda in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once more Māgandiyā conspired with her uncle against Sāmāvatī.  They had all the pillars of Sāmāvatī's house wrapt in cloth, soaked in oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to.  Sāmāvatī saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, and they attained to various fruits of the Path.  Udena questioned Māgandiyā very carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime.  He then sent for all Māgandiya's relations saying that he wished to reward them.  He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed with an iron plough.  Pieces of flesh were ripped from Māgandiyā's body, fried like cakes in oil, and Māgandiyā was then forced to eat them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.i.201f., 210ff.; UdA.383f.; cf.  Dvy., 515ff., where Māgandiyā is called Anūpamā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātanga Jātaka (No.  497)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in a Candāla village outside Benares and was named Mātanga.  One day, when Ditthamangalikā, the daughter of a rich merchant, was on her way to the park with a group of friends, she saw Mātanga coming towards the city, and thinking the sight inauspicious, washed her eyes with perfumed water and turned back home.  Her companions, annoyed at being deprived of their fun, beat Mātanga and left him senseless.  On recovering consciousness, he determined to get Ditthamangalikā as wife and lay down outside her father's house refusing to move.  Seven days he lay thus until her relations, fearing the ignominy of having a candāla die at their door, gave Ditthamangalikā to him as wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing her pride to be quelled by this act, Mātanga decided to bring her great honour.  He, therefore, retired into the forest and in seven days, won supernatural power.  On his return he told her to proclaim abroad that her husband was not a candāla but Mahābrahmā, and that seven days later, on the night of the full moon, he would come to her, breaking through the moon's disk.  She did as he said and so it happened.  The people thenceforth honoured her as a goddess; the water in which she washed her feet was used for the coronation of kings, and in one single day she received eighteen crores from those who were allowed the privilege of saluting her.  Mātanga touched her navel with his thumb, and, knowing that she had conceived a son, admonished her to be vigilant and returned to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son was born in the pavilion, which the people had constructed for the use of Ditthamangalikā, and was therefore called Mandavya,.  At the age of sixteen he knew all the Vedas and fed sixteen thousand brahmins daily.  On a feast day Mātanga came to him, thinking to turn him from his wrong doctrines, but Mandavya failed to recognize him and had him cast out by his servants, Bhandakucchi, Upajjhāya, and Upajotiya.  The gods of the city thereupon grew angry and twisted the necks of Mandavya and all the brahmins so that their eyes looked over their shoulders.  When Ditthamangalikā heard of this she sought Mātanga, who had left his footsteps so that she might know where he was.  He asked her to sprinkle on the brahmins water in which were dissolved the leavings of his food; to Mandavya himself was given some of the food.  On recovering and seeing the plight of the brahmins, he realized his error.  The brahmins recovered, but were shunned by their colleagues; they left the country and went to live in the kingdom of Mejjha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bank of the Vettavatī lived a brahmin called Jātimanta, very proud of his birth.  Mātanga went thither to humble the pride of Jātimanta and lived higher up stream.  One day he nibbled a tooth stick and threw it into the river, where, lower down, it got entangled in Jātimanta's hair.  He was greatly annoyed and went up stream, where he found Mātanga and told him that, if he stayed there any longer, at the end of seven days his head would split into seven pieces.  On the seventh day Mātanga stopped the sun from rising.  On discovering the cause, the people dragged Jātimanta to Mātanga and made him ask forgiveness, falling at Mātanga's feet.  Jātimanta's head was covered with a lump of clay, which was immersed in the water as the sun rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mātanga then went to the kingdom of Mejjha, where the exiled brahmins reported against him to the king, saying that he was a juggler and a mountebank.  The king's messengers surprised Mātanga as he was eating his food beside a well, and cut off his head.  He was born in the Brahma world.  The gods were angry and wiped out the whole kingdom of Mejjha by pouring on it torrents of hot ashes.  Before his meeting with Ditthamangalikā the Bodhisatta was a mongoose tamer (kondadamaka).  But in SNA.i.186, he is called a sopākajīvika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the attempt of King Udena (q.i) to torture Pindolabhāradvāja.  Udena is identified with Mandavya.  J.iv.375 90; the story is found also at SNA.i.184 93, with alterations in certain details e.g., for Vettavatī we have Bandhumatī; see also Mil.123ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manoja Jātaka (No.  397)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a lion and had a son called Manoja.  One day Manoja, in spite of his father's warnings, made friends with a jackal called Giriya.  Acting on Giriya's suggestion, Manoja went in search of horse flesh and attacked the king's horses, The king engaged the services of an archer, who shot Manoja as he was making off with a horse.  Manoja managed to reach his den, but there he fell down dead (J.iii.321ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances in which the story was related are similar to those of the Mahilāmukha Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; bore in a previous birth when he was born as a man in Macalagāma in Magadha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual form of the name is a derivative - e.g., J.vi.212; he is often called Maghavā Sujampati &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- e.g., J.iii.146; iv.403; v.137, 139; vi.102, 481, 573; or Maghavā Sakko &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- e.g., J.v.141; see also Mtu.i.165, 167 (sahasranetro Maghavān va sobhase) and Mtu.iii.366 (Sakro āha: Maghavān ti me āhu syaloke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story is given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kulaavaka_jat_31,Kulāvaka Jātaka')"&gt;Kulāvaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  For a slightly different version see DhA.i.264ff.  Because of his birth as Magha, Sakka came to be known as Maghavā.  Maghavā was, perhaps, not the personal name of any particular Sakka, but a title of all Sakkas, because the Sakka who was the real Magha is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.i.207), while the Buddha says (S.i.231; DhA.i.264) that the Sakka, who visited him, and whose conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, was also known as Maghavā.  The title probably originated from the time when Magha became Sakka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.267; this is supported by the story as given in DA.iii.710 ff.  and DhA.i.264ff., where no mention is made of the Bodhisatta), however, says that Magha was not the Bodhistatta, but that his life was like that of a Bodhisatta (Bodhisattacariyā viyassa cariyā ahosi); in which case the name Maghavā belongs only to the present Sakka.  Magha took upon himself seven vows (vatapadāni), which brought him birth as Sakka: to maintain his parents, to revere his elders, to use gentle language, to utter no slander, to be free from avarice, to practise generosity and open handed liberality and kindness, to speak the truth, to be free from anger (S.i.227f.; SA.i.267).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this and other titles of Sakka, see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māhissati&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in the Buddha's day, mentioned as lying on the route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvari')"&gt;Bāvari's&lt;/a&gt; hermitage to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; (SN.  vs.  1011).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagovinda_s,Mahāgovinda Sutta')"&gt;Mahāgovinda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.) it was the capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avanti,Avanti')"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; and was founded at the same time as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa,Campā')"&gt;Campā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably the capital of Southern Avanti, Avanti Dakkhināpatha, the capital of Northern Avanti being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjenī')"&gt;Ujjenī&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Māhābhārata (ii.31, 10) Avanti and Māhismati are spoken of as two different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātuputtika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a mother and her son &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- a monk and a nun - spent the rainy season at Sāvatthi.  They saw much of each other and, in course of time, became guilty of incest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this was reported to the Buddha, he declared that nothing ensnares the heart of a man as does a woman; she is indeed a noose of Māra.  A.iii.67f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mañcadāyaka &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mañcadāyaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a Candāla, and made a lintel which he offered to the Order.  He was fifty times king of the gods and eighty times king of men.  Ap.ii.377f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mañcadāyaka.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant Thera.  Ninety one kappas ago he gave a bed to Vipassī Buddha (Ap.ii.455).  He is probably identical with Sāmaññakāni Thera (ThagA.i.99).  v.l.  Pecchadāyaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhurā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Madhurā.  &lt;/b&gt; The capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/surasena,Surasena')"&gt;Surasena&lt;/a&gt;, situated on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa,Yamunā')"&gt;Yamunā&lt;/a&gt;.  Its king, soon after the death of Bimbisāra, was Avantiputta (M.ii.83), who, judging by his name, was probably related to the royal family of Ujjeni.  Madhurā was visited by the Buddha (A.ii.57; iii.256), but there is no record of his having stayed there.  In fact, the Madhura Sutta (2) (q.v.) states that he viewed the city with distinct disfavour.  But Mahā Kaccāna evidently liked it, for he stayed there in the Gundāvana, and was visited there by the king of the city, Avantiputta (M.ii.83), and the brahmin Kandarāyana (A.i.67).  One of the most important suttas on caste, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madhura_s,Madhura Sutta 1')"&gt;Madhura Sutta 1&lt;/a&gt;, was preached to Avantiputta by Mahā Kaccāna at Madhurā.  Perhaps it was through the agency of Mahā Kaccāna that Buddhism gained ground in Madhurā.  Already in the Buddha's time there were, in and around Madhurā, those who accepted his teachings, for the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.57) mentions that once when he was journeying from Madhurā to Verañjā and stopped under a tree by the wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped him.  Later, about 300 B.C., Madhurā became a Jain centre (CHI.i.167), but when Fa Hsien (Giles, p.  20) and Hiouen Thsang visited it, Buddhism was flourishing there, and there were many sanghārāmas and stūpas.  Beal.i.179ff.; for a prophecy (attributed to the Buddha) regarding the future greatness of Madhurā, see Dvy.348ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Sankassa to Madhurā was a distance of four yojanas (thus in Kaccāyana's Grammar, iii.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madhurā is sometimes referred to as Uttara Madhurā, to distinguish it from a city of the same name in South India.  Thus, in the Vimānavatthu Commentary (VvA.118f), a woman of Uttara Madhurā is mentioned as having been born in Tāvatimsa as a result of having given alms to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ghata Jātaka (J.iv.79ff) speaks of Mahāsāgara as the king of Uttara&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;Madhurā, and relates what is evidently the story of Kamsa's attempt to tyrannize over Madhurā by overpowering the Yādavas and his consequent death at the hands of Krsna, a story which is found both in the Epics and in the Purānas.  This Jātaka confirms the Brahmanical tradition as to the association of Vasudeva's family with Madhurā (PHAL, p.  89).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story (Cv.xcii.23ff ) of a king called Mahāsena of Pātaliputta, who was very generous in feeding the monks, and once thought of giving alms by cultivating a piece of land himself.  He, therefore, went to Uttara Madhurā in disguise, worked as a labourer, and held an almsgiving with the gains so obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madhurā is generally identified with Maholi, five miles to the Southeast of the present town of Mathurā or Muttra.  It is the Modura of Ptolemy and the Methoras of Pliny (CAGI.  427f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milindapañha (p.  331) refers to Madhurā as one of the chief cities of India.  In the past, Sādhina and twenty two of his descendants, the last of whom was Dhammagutta, reigned in Madhurā (Dpv.iii.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Madhurā.  &lt;/b&gt; A city in South India, in the Madras Presidency, and now known as Madura.  It is generally referred to as Dakkhina-Madhurā, to distinguish it from (Uttara-)Madhura on the Yamunā.  Dakkhina-Madhurā was the second capital of the Pandyan kingdom (their first being Korkai, see Vincent Smith, EHI.335ff), and there was constant intercourse between this city and Ceylon.  From Madhurā came the consort of Vijaya, first king of Ceylon, and she was accompanied by many maidens of various families who settled in Ceylon (Mhv.vii.49ff).  Sena II.  sent an army to pillage Madhurā, and set upon the throne a Pandu prince who had begged for his support (Cv.li.27ff).  Later, Madhurā was attacked by Kulasekhara, and its king, Parakkama, sought the assistance of Parakkamabāhu I.  of Ceylon.  The latter sent an army under his general Lankāpura, but in the meantime the Pāndyan king had been slain and his capital taken.  The Singhalese army, however, landed on the opposite coast and carried on a war against the Colas, and built a fortress near Rāmnād, which they called Parakkamapura.  They managed to defeat Kulasekhara and restore the crown of Madhurā to the Pāndyan king's son, Vīra Pandu.  The captives taken by the army were sent to Ceylon.  For details see Cv.lxxvi.76ff.; lxxvii.1ff.; see also Cv.Trs.ii.100, n.  1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rājasīha II.  is said to have obtained wives from Madhurā (Cv.xcvi.40), as did his successors Vimaladhammasūriya II., Narindasīha and Vijayarājasīha.  Ibid., xcvii.2, 24; xcviii.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makhādeva Jātaka (No.  9)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Makhādeva, king of Mithilā in Videha.  For successive periods of eighty four thousand years each he had respectively amused himself as prince, ruled as viceroy, and reigned as king.  He one day asked his barber to tell him as soon as he had any grey hairs.  When, many years later, the barber found a grey hair, he pulled it out and laid it on the king's palm as he had been requested.  The king had eighty-four thousand years yet to live, but he granted the barber a village yielding one hundred thousand, and, on that very day, gave over the kingdom to his son and renounced the world as though he had seen the King of Death.  For eighty four thousand years he lived as a recluse in the Makhādeva-ambavana and was reborn in the Brahma world.  Later, he became once more king of Mithilā under the name of Nimi, and in that life, too, he became a recluse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barber is identified with Ananda and the son with Rāhula.  The story was related to some monks who were talking one day about the Buddha's Renunciation.  J.i.137ff.; cp.  M.ii.74ff., and J.vi.95. See Thomas: op.  cit., 127.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Malaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Malaya.&lt;/b&gt; A mountainous district in South India.  E.g., J.iv.327; Cv.lxxvi.195.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Malaya.&lt;/b&gt; The mountainous country of Ceylon, originally the home of the Pulindā (Mhv.vii.68; see Mhv.Trs.60, n.  5).  When Dutthagāmanī fled from his father's wrath, it was in Malaya that he hid (Mhv.xxiv.7).  In Malaya was the Ambatthakolalena, from which Dutthagāmanī obtained silver for the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.20).  The hill country provided protection from marauders who invaded Ceylon (E.g., in the case of Vattagāmanī; Mhv.xxxiii.62; also xxxv.26), and also from those causing danger to the rightful ruler (E.g., ibid., xxxvi.50; Cv.xli.20; l.20).  When Buddhism was threatened by the activities of unbelievers who had obtained possession of Anurādhapura, it was to Malaya and to Rohana that the monks fled in order to save themselves and their teaching (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6).  Malaya also afforded shelter to rebels against the government both during preparations for attack and, if necessary, during their flight (E.g., Cv.xli.10; xliv.62; xlviii.98; li.112f.; lvii.47, 57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times Malaya was treated as a special province, and was in charge of an official called Malayarāja, who was generally the king's younger son, the elder being viceroy in charge of the Eastern Province (Pācīnadesa).  The district of Dakkhinadesa was included in Malaya (See Cv.xli.33ff.; lii.68; Cv.  Trs.i.54, n.4; but see Cv.xlii.6, 10; xliv.43 li.13; liii.36), but it was later separated (Cv.li.8).  The Yuvarāja himself was sometimes Malayarājā, particularly when the other provinces were in the hands of enemies (E.g., Cv.lviii.7).  Mention is also made (Cv.lxix.6) of a Malayarājā who was in charge of a Damila army (probably of mercenaries).  In times of war the people of Malaya usually gave a great deal of trouble as the country was difficult of access (E.g., Cv.lxx.30).  Some of the villages in Malaya were composed of only one house.  Sp.ii.298.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Malaya.  &lt;/b&gt; The mountainous district of Rāmañña.  Cv.lxxvi.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mallikārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pleasance in Sāvatthi belonging to Queen Mallikā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is described as "Samayappavādakatindukācīra - (v.l.  tindukākhīra)- ekasalaka." D.i.178; M.ii.22, etc.; Sp.i.107, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (MA.ii.710; cf.  DA.ii.365) says it was called Samyappavādaka because teachers holding various views used to gather there and discourse on their doctrines.  It was surrounded by tindukakhīra (timbaru) trees, hence tindukācīra (sic); at first it possessed only one hall, but later many were erected through the good fortune of Potthapāda - hence its epithet Ekasālāka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mallikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mallikā.&lt;/b&gt; Chief queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, king of Kosala.  She was the daughter of the chief garland maker of Kosala, and was very good and beautiful.  When she was sixteen she was, one day, on her way to the garden with some companions, carrying with her three portions of sour gruel in a basket.  Meeting the Buddha, she offered them to him and worshipped him.  The Buddha, seeing her wrapt in joy, smiled, and, in answer to Ananda's question, said she would be chief queen of Kosala that very day.  J.iii.405; SA.i.110ff.  It was to explain Mallikā's good fortune that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kummaasapinda_jat_416,Kummāsapinda Jātaka')"&gt;Kummāsapinda Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happened that Pasenadi, having suffered defeat at the hands of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt; that very day, was passing by and entered the flower garden, attracted by Mallikā's voice.  Mallikā, seeing him coming, and noting his weariness, seized his horse's bridle.  The king, discovering that she was unmarried, dismounted, and, having rested awhile, his head on her lap, entered the town with her and took her to her own house.  In the evening he sent a chariot for her, and with great honour and pomp brought her from her own home, set her on a heap of jewels and anointed her chief queen.  From that day onward she was the beloved and devoted wife of the king and an undeviating follower of the Buddha (DhA.iii.121f).  The king found her sagacious and practical minded and consulted her and accepted her advice when in difficulty - e.g., in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,Asadisa')"&gt;Asadisa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asadisadaana,-dāna')"&gt;-dāna&lt;/a&gt;, wherein he wished to excel his subjects, and again when he was troubled by evil dreams as narrated in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasupina_jat_077,Mahāsupīna Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāsupīna Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  DhA.ii.8ff.  says that Mallikā called the king a simpleton for putting his faith in brahmins and took him to the Buddha, and while the king sat trembling, asked the questions for him and had them explained.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka states how Mallikā saved many innocent lives from being sacrificed, and the Buddha declared that in a past life too, as Dinnā (q.v.), she had saved the lives of a large number of people by her wisdom (DhA.ii.15f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Mallikā and Pasenadi's other queen, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa,Vāsabhakhattiyā')"&gt;Vāsabhakhattiyā&lt;/a&gt;, desired to learn the Dhamma, and, at their request conveyed through Pasenadi, the Buddha asked Ananda to visit the palace regularly and teach them the Doctrine.  Ananda found in Mallikā an apt and ready pupil, conscientious in her work; Vāsabhakhattiyā was not so devoted to her duties.  DhA.i.382f.  For an incident connected with Ananda's visit to the palace, see Vin.iv.158f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallika's knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked if anyone were dearer to her than her own "self." "No, Sire," was the answer; the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who explained to him that Mallikā, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth (S.i.75; Ud.v.1).  Mallikā, though an exemplary wife, was not without lapses.  Reference is made to the quarrels she had with her husband, once, at least, on the question of conjugal rights, as a result of which they both sulked and had to be reconciled by the Buddha.  J.iv.437; also J.iii.20; in these quarrels the king was probably more to blame than Mallikā; it is said that until reconciled by the Buddha he ignored her very existence, saying that prosperity had turned her head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.119ff) relates a ridiculous story about her misbehaviour with a dog in the bath house.  Pasenadi was a witness of this scene, but she was able to convince him that it was the fault of the lighting of the bath house.  Nevertheless, it is said that at the moment of her death she recollected this misdeed, and, as a result, was reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici,Avīci')"&gt;Avīci&lt;/a&gt;.  The king was overcome by grief at Mallika's death, and, after the funeral rites, went to the Buddha to ask where she had been reborn.  The Buddha, not wishing him to know, caused the king to forget the question, every time he came to the vihāra, for a whole week, till Mallikā's suffering in Avīci was over; then he allowed the question to be asked, and he was able to assure Pasenadi that she had been reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita,Tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt; and to console him in his grief.  It is said (A.iii.57) that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came with the whispered message that the queen was dead.  It was a terrible shock, "his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of a son.  Probably &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajiraakumaarii,Vajīrī')"&gt;Vajīrī&lt;/a&gt;, who is spoken of as the king's only daughter (M.ii.110).  He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men (S.i.86f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā is mentioned (Mil.  115, 291) as one of seven persons whose acts of devotion bore fruit in this life and whose fame reached even to the gods.  Only one instance is on record of Mallikā asking a question of the Buddha.  She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some rich, and others poor.  And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these discrepancies (See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa_s,Mallikā Sutta 1')"&gt;Mallikā Sutta 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/piyajatika_sutta,Piyajātika Sutta')"&gt;Piyajātika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.106ff ) Pasenadi is said to have taunted her because "her recluse Gotama" had said that dear ones bring sorrow and tribulation.  "If the Lord says so, it must be so," she replies; but secretly sends Nālijangha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so and why.  Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā had a garden, called the Mallikārāma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees (tindukācīra) set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects (samayappavādaka).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magadha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vamsas and Avanti.  Magadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned.  Later, Pātaliputta became the capital.  By the time of Bimbisāra, Anga, too, formed a part of Magadha, and he was known as king of Anga Magadha (see, e.g., Vin.i.27 and ThagA.i.544, where Bimbisāra sends for Sona Kolivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Anga).  But prior to that, these were two separate kingdoms, often at war with each other (e.g., J.iv.454f).  Several kings of Magadha are mentioned by name in the Jātakas - e.g., Arindama and Duyyodhana.  In one story (J.vi.272) the Magadha kingdom is said to have been under the suzerainty of Anga.  In the Buddha's day, Magadha (inclusive of Anga) consisted of eighty thousand villages (Vin.i.179) and had a circumference of some three hundred leagues (DA.i.148).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books (e.g., D.ii.73f., 86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Bimbisāra and Ajātasattu, Magadha rose to such political eminence that for several centuries, right down to the time of Asoka, the history of Northern India was practically the history of Magadha.  (A list of the kings from Bimbisāra to Asoka is found in Dvy.369 ; cp.  DA.i.153; Mbv.96, 98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Magadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā (Campā flowed between Anga and Magadha; J.iv.454), on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Sona, and on the north by the Ganges.  The latter river formed the boundary between Magadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.  When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Bimbisāra made a road five leagues long, from Rājagaha to the river, and decorated it, and the Licchavis did the same on the other side.  DhA.iii.439 f.; the Dvy.  (1p.55) says that monks going from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha could cross the Ganges in boats kept either by Ajātasattu or by the Licchavis of Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early Buddhist period Magadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning.  The kings of Magadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other's sisters.  Mention is made of an alliance between Pukkusāti, king of Gandhāra and Bimbisāra.  When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Magadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampatī in Vin.i.5, pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo, etc.), and it was from Magadha that it spread after the Third Council.  The Buddha's chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Magadha.  In Asoka's time the income from the four gates of his capital of Pātaliputta was four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, and in the Sabhā, or Council, he would daily receive another hundred thousand kahāpanas (Sp.i.52).  The cornfields of Magadha were rich and fertile (Thag.vs.208), and each Magadha field was about one gāvuta in extent.  Thus AA.ii.616 explains the extent of Kakudha's body, which filled two or three Māgadha village fields (A.iii.122).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of several places in Magadha occur in the books- e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigāma, Khānumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Mātulā, Ambalatthikā, Pātaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.135 f ) that there are many fanciful explanations (bahudhā papañcanti) of the word Magadha.  One such is that king Cetiya, when about to be swallowed up by the earth for having introduced lying into the world, was thus admonished by those standing round - "Mā gadham pavisa;” another that those who were digging in the earth saw the king, and that he said to them: " Mā gadham karotha." The real explanation, accepted by Buddhaghosa himself, seems to have been that the country was the residence of a tribe of khattiyas called Magadhā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Magadhabhāsā is regarded as the speech of the Āriyans (e.g., Sp.i.255).  If children grow up without being taught any language, they will spontaneously use the Magadha language; it is spread all over Niraya, among lower animals, petas, humans and devas (VibhA.387f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Anga and Magadha were in the habit of holding a great annual sacrifice to Māha Brahmā in which a fire was kindled with sixty cartloads of firewood.  They held the view that anything cast into the sacrificial fire would bring a thousand fold reward.  SA.i.269; but it is curious that in Vedic, Brāhmana and Sūtra periods, Magadha was considered as outside the pale of Ariyan and Brahmanical culture, and was therefore looked down upon by Brahmanical writers.  But it was the holy land of the Buddhists.  See VT.ii.207; Thomas: op.  cit., 13, 96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magadha was famous for a special kind of garlic (Sp.iv.920) and the Magadha nāla was a standard of measure.  (E.g., AA.i.101).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magadha is identified with the modern South Behar.

Ninety one kappas ago he saw the Buddha (? Vipassī) seated in meditation on the banks of the Nammudā, and honoured him by placing a maghava flower near him.  Ap.i.240f.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mandūka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deva.  In his previous birth he was a frog on the banks of the Gaggarā, and, hearing the Buddha preach, was attracted by his voice.  A cowherd, who stood leaning on a stick, drove it unwittingly into the frog's head and it died immediately, to be reborn in Tāvatimsa in a palace twelve yojanas in extent.  Having discovered his previous birth, he appeared before the Buddha, revealed his identity and worshipped him.  The Buddha preached to him, and the deva became a sotāpanna.  Eighty four thousand others realized the Truth.  Vv.v.1; VvA.216ff.; Vsm.208f.; Sp.i.121; Mil.350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manopadosikā (Manopadūsikā)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of devas living in the Cātummahārājika world (DA.i.114; AA.ii.544; MNid.108).  They burn continually with envy one against another (Buddhaghosa relates a story illustrating this in DA.i.114) and their hearts become ill disposed and debauched.  Their bodies thus become feeble and their minds imbecile, and, as a consequence, they fall from their state (D.i.20; iii.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manopadosikā were among those present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.260).  They are so called because their minds are debauched by envy (dosassa anudahanatāya) (VibhA.498).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mālunkyāputta &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mālunkyāputta Thera&lt;/b&gt; (v.l.  Mālunkyaputta, Mālukyaputta).  Son of the assessor (agghāpanika) of the king of Kosala, his mother being Mālunkyā.  He was religious by nature, and, when he came of age, became a Paribbājaka.  Later, he heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order, becoming an Arahant (ThagA.i.446f).  The Theragāthā contains two sets of verses attributed to him: one (vv.  399 404) spoken on his visit to his home after attaining arahantship when his people tried to lure him back by a great display of hospitality; the other* in connection with a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha before he became an Arahant.  The Thera asked the Buddha for a doctrine in brief and the Buddha gave him one.  The verses contain a detailed account of the stanzas which were only outlined to him by the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Majjhima Nikāya are two suttas &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- the Cūla Mālunkyā and the Mahā, Mālunkyā (this is referred to at Mil.  144) &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- both evidently preached before Mālunkyāputta's attainment of arahantship, because in both the Buddha speaks disparagingly of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* vv.  794&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-817; the reference is probably to the Mālunkyāputta Sutta of A.ii.248; see also S.iv.72, where the verses are quoted in full.  There the monk is described as a broken down old man, far on in years.  The Commentators (AA.ii.582 and SA.iii.20) add that he had, in his youth, neglected the detailed teaching and fallen back, through love of possessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mālunkyāputta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Mālunkyāputta comes to the Buddha in his old age and asks for a teaching in brief.  The Buddha first chides him for having wasted his opportunities, but then tells him of the four ways in which craving arises and the advantages of destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mālunkyāputta retires into the forest and shortly after becomes an arahant.  A.ii.248f.; AA.ii.582f.; cp.  S.iv.72f.  and SA.iii.20f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the Evil One, the Tempter (the Buddhist counterpart of the Devil or Principle of Destruction).  The legends concerning Māra are, in the books, very involved and defy any attempts at unravelling them.  In the latest accounts, mention is made of five Māras &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Khandha Māra, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kilesa Māra, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abhisankhāra Māra, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maccu Māra and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devaputta Māra &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;as shown in the following quotations: pañcannam pi Mārānam vijayato jino (ThagA.ii.16); sabbāmittehi khandha-kilesā-bhisankhāramaccudeva-puttasankhāte, sabbapaccatthike (ThagA.ii.46); sankhepato vā pañcakilesa-khandhābhi-sankhāra-devaputta-maccumāre abhañji, tasmā .  .  .  bhagavā ti vuccati (Vsm.211).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, however, Māra is spoken of as one, three, or four.  Where Māra is one, the reference is generally either to the kilesas or to Death.  Thus: Mārenāti kilesamārena (ItvA.197); Mārassa visaye ti kilesamārassa visaye (ThagA.ii.70); jetvāna maccuno senam vimokkhena anāvaran ti lokattayābhibyāpanato diyaddhasahassādi vibhāgato ca vipulattā aññehi avāritum patisedhetum asakkuneyyattā ca maccuno, Mārassa, senam vimokkhena ariyamaggena jetvā (ItvA.198); Mārāsenā ti ettha satte anatthe niyojento māretīti Māro (UdA.325); nihato Māro bodhimūle ti vihato samucchinno kilesamāro bodhirukkhamūle (Netti Cty.  235); vasam Mārassa gacchatīti kilesamārassa ca sattamārassa (?) ca vasam gacchi (Netti, p.  86); tato sukhmnataram Mārabandhanan ti kilesabandhanam pan' etam tato sukhumataram (SA.iii.82); Māro māro ti maranam pucchati, māradhammo ti maranadhammo (SA.ii.246).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently with this same significance that the term Māra, in the older books, is applied to the whole of the worldly existence, the five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbāna.  Thus Māra is defined at CNid.  (No.  506) as kammābhisankhāravasena patisandhiko kandhamāro dhātumāro, āyatanamāro.  And again: Māro Māro ti bhante vuccati katamo nu kho bhante Māro ti? Rūpam kho, Rādha, Māro, vedanāmāro, saññāmāro, sankhāramāro viññānam Māro (S.iii.195); yo kho Rādha Māro tatra chando pahātabbo.  Ko ca Rādha Māro? Rūpam kho Rādha Māro .  .  .  pe .  .  .  vedanāmāro.  Tatra kho Rādha chando pahātabbo (S.iii.198); sa upādiyamāno kho bhikku baddho Mārassa, anupadiyamāno mutto pāpimāto (S.iii.74); evam sukhumam kho bhikkhave, Vepacittibandhanam; tato sukhumataram mārabandhanam; maññamāno kho bhikkhave baddho Mārassa, amaññamāno mutto pāpimato (S.iv.202); labhati Māro otāram, labhati Māro ārammanam (S.iv.85); santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyarūpā ...  pe .  .  .  tañ ce bhikkhu abhinandati .  .  .  pe .  .  .  ayam vuccati bhikkhave bhikkhu āvāsagato Mārassa, Mārassa vasam, gato (S.iv.91); dhunātha maccuno senam nalāgāram va kuñjaro ti paññindriyassa padathānam (Netti, p.  40); rūpe kho Rādha sati Māro vā assa māretā vā yo vā pana mīyati.  Tasmā he tvam Rādha rūpam māro ti passa māretā ti passa mīyatīti passa ...  ye nam evam passanti te sammā passanti (S.iii.189); Mārasamyogan ti tebhūmakavattam (SNA.ii.506).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries also speak of three Māras: bodhipallanke tinnam Mārānam matthakam bhinditvā (DA.ii.659); aparājitasanghan ti ajj' eva tayo Māre madditvā vijitasangānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisambuddho (CNidA.  p.  47).  In some cases the three Māras are specified: yathayidam bhikkhave mārabalan ti yathā idam devaputtamāra maccumāra kilesamārānam balam appasaham durabhisambhavam (DA.iii.858); maccuhāyino ti maranamaccu kilesamccu devaputtamaccu hāyino, tividham pi tam maccum hitvā gāmino ti vuttam hoti (SNA.ii.508; cp.  MA.ii.619); na lacchati Māro otāram, Māro ti devaputtmāro pi maccumāro pi kilesamāro pi (DA.iii.846); but elsewhere five are mentioned e.g., ariyamaggakkhane kilesamāro abhisahkhāramāro, devaputtamāro ca carimaka cittakkhane khandhamāro maccumāro ti pañcavidhamāro abhibhūto parājito (UdA.216).  Very occasionally four Māras are mentioned: catunnam Mārānam matthakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisamabuddho (MNid.  129); indakhīlopamo catubbidhamāraparavādiganehi akampiyatthena (SNA.i.201); Mārasenam sasenam abhibhuyyāti kilesasenāya anantasenāya ca sasenam anavasittham, catubbidham pi māram abhibhavitvā devaputtamārassā pi hi gunamārane sahāyabhāvūpagamanato kilesā senā ti vuccanti (ItvA.136).  The last quotation seems to indicate that the four Māras are the five Māras less Devaputta Māra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few particulars are available about Devaputta Māra: Māro ti Vasavattibhūmiyam aññataro dāmarikadevaputto.  So hi tam thānam atikkamitukāmam janam yam na sakkoti tam māreti, yam na sakkoti tassa pi maranam icchati, tenā Māro ti vuccati (SNA.i.44); Māro yeva pana sattasankhātāya pajāya adhipatibhāvena idha Pajāpatīti adhippeto.  So hi kuhim vasatīti? Paranimmittavasavattidevaloke.  Tatra hi Vasavattirājā rajjam kāreti.  Māro ekasmim padese attano parisāya issariyam pavattento rajjapaccante dāmarikarājapittto viya vasatī ti vadanti (MA.i.28); so hi Māro opapātiko kāmāvacarissaro, kadāci brahmapārisajjānampi kāye adhimuccitum samattho (Jinālankāra Tīkā, p.217).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In view of the many studies of Māra by various scholars, already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Māra in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data.  The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death.  From this it was extended to mean "the world under the sway of death" (also called Māradheyya - e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein.  Thence, the kilesas also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world.  All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death.  There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority.  As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway.  Thus: Those who can restrain the mind and check its propensities can escape the snares of Māra (Dhp.  Yamaka, vs.  7).  He who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under Māra's sway (S.iv.91).  He who has attachment is entangled by Māra (S.iii.73).  Māra will overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle and weak (Dhp.  Yamaka, vs.  8).  By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be free from Māra (Dhp.  vs.  40).  The Samyutta (i.  135) records a conversation between Māra and Vajirā.  She has attained arahantship, and tells Māra: "There is no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap of sankhāras (suddhasankhārarapuñja).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The later books, especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp.  MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.  239f), contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha by Māra, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his Enlightenment.  These accounts describe how Māra, the devaputta, seeing the Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his forces and advanced against him.  These forces extended to a distance of twelve yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the right and to the left.  Māra himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height.  His followers assumed various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons.  At Māra's approach, all the various Devas, Nāgas and others, who were gathered round the Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong flight.  The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the ten pārami which he had practiced to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māra's army is described as being tenfold, and each division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail.  Each division was faced by the Buddha with one pāramī and was put to flight.  Māra's last weapon was the Cakkāvudha (q.v.).  But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a canopy of flowers.  Still undaunted, Māra challenged the Buddha to show that the seat on which he sat was his by right.  Māra's followers all shouted their evidence that the seat was Māra's.  The Buddha, having no other witness, asked the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response.  Māra and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered round the Buddha to celebrate his victory.  The sun set on the defeat of Māra.  This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha's conquest of Māra, greatly elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines and temples with all the wealth of riotous color and fanciful imagery that gifted artists could command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That this account of the Buddha's struggle with Māra is literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the present day.  The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids (Article on Buddha in the Ency.  Brit.).  We are to understand by the attack of Māra's forces, that all the Buddha's "old temptations came back upon him with renewed force.  For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again with attractive colors.  He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come out even purified from the struggle." There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op.  cit., 230), whether we can assume that the elaborators of the Māra story were recording "a subjective experience under the form of an objective reality," and did they know or think that this was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid of the rationalists.  The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the elaboration so dear to the hearts of the Pāli rhapsodists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their commentarial works - e.g., in the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra (ZDMG.  vol.  49 (1915), 321ff ) bears no close parallelism to the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the Māra legend had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta (q.v.).  There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjarā, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works.  Gotama refers to Māra's army as being tenfold.  The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others.  "Seeing this army on all sides," says the Buddha, "I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage (savāhanam).  He shall not make me yield ground.  That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone." Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Padhāna Sutta (SN.  vs.  446f.; cf.  S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us.  After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part.  But the quest was in vain, and, "like a crow attacking a rock," he left Gotama in disgust.  "The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm.  Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence." This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was picked up by Sakka and given to Pañcasikha.  Of this part of the sutta, more anon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal.  490 (378); cp.  A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta ("Dhītaro" Sutta) in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment.  Their names are Tanhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra's army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta.  They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans.  Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the Buddha's first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra's fetters.  But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22).  On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines.  (S.i.67; cp.  DhA.iv.141, where Māra asks the Buddha about the further shore.  In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world).  The Māra Samyutta (S.i.103ff ) contains several instances of Māra's temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūta fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers (E.g., at Ekasalā; cf.  Nigrodha and his fellow Paribbājakas, D.iii.58).  Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, Māra came in the guise of a bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were distracted.  Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pañcasālā, he entered into the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl.  Māra approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury in addition to neglect.  But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that day on pīti, like the Abhassara gods.  The incident is related at length in SA.i.140f.  and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Verañja (q.v.) was also due to the machinations of Māra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on Nibbāna, Māra came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if anyone had seen his oxen.  His desire was to make the cares of the present life break in on the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbāna.  On another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers.  Once, at the Sākyan village of Sīlavatī, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time.  In the same village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations.  Samiddhi sought the Buddha's help and went back and won arahantship.  (Cp.  the story of Nandiya Thera.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when Sūrambattha, after listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, Māra visited him there in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached to him earlier was false.  Sūrambattha, though surprised, could not be shaken in his faith, being a sotāpanna).  Māra influenced Godhika to commit suicide and tried to frighten Rāhula in the guise of a huge elephant.  (DhA.iv.69f ).  In the account of Godhika's suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his (Godhika's) consciousness (patisandhicitta), and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, "going about like a cloud of smoke." Later, Māra came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddadārakavannī), (SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha about Godhika.  (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks regarding Godhika's destiny.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots - e.g., Ālavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.  To the same category of temptations belongs a story found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his journey of Renunciation, Māra, here called Vasavattī, appeared before him and promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but turn back.  Māra's temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness - e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife.  (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.  Can it be that here we have the word Māra used in the sense of physical death (Maccumāra), and that the occasions referred to were those on which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to "lay down the burden"? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death's door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, digestive disorders and headache.  (It is true that in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta (M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is there any mention of the Bodhi tree.  But to argue from this, that such events did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvagāma, shortly before he finally decided to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp.  Dvy.  203) that "there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death." But the Buddha conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of the Order.  Compare with this Māra's temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi (q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot by a splinter.  It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f).  We know of other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried by physical ills - e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, Channa.  When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free from all blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can it be, further, that with the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nikāya, Māra is described (aggo ādhipateyyānam iddhiyā yasasā jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds and as a dāmarika devaputta (as mentioned earlier).  A.ii.17. Even after the Buddha's death Māra was regarded as wishing to obstruct good works.  Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha's relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of Māra (Mhv.xxxi.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) that Māradevaputta, having dogged the Buddha's footsteps for seven years, and having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him.  Is it, then, possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have had with Māra - e.g., in the second part of the Padhāna Sutta (see above) were originally ascribed to a real personage, designated as Māradevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical Māra? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333; cp.  D.iii.79) uttered by Moggallāna, that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister's name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew.  In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama's day.  According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.  This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation.  See also Mārakāyikā deva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māra bears many names in Pāli Literature, chief of them being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu.  (MNid.ii.489; for their explanation see MNidA.328; another name of Māra was Pajāpati, MA.i.28).  His usual standing epithet is pāpimā, but other words are also used, such as anatthakāma, ahitakāma, and ayogakkhemakāma (E.g., M.i.118).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māra is called Namuci because none can escape him Namucī ti Māro; so hi attano visayā nikkhamitukāme devamanusse na muñcati antarāyam tesam karoti tasma Namucī ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386).  In the Mahāsamaya Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly.  D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p.  261f.) it is said that when all the devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his "swarthy host" and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc.  But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and Māra had to depart unsuccessful.  At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally ascribed to Māra.  They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers.  In this sutta Māra is described as mahāsena (having a large army).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to Māradevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandikā abhabbā, ayam pi tādiso yeva, tasmā dhātuso samsandamāno āgato).  Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp.  MNidA.  328) that Māra is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte māreti ti Māro; he is called Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all Māro nāma vasavattī sabesam upari vasam vattati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;Kālī (Kālā) is the mother of Māra of the present age.

From the time of his son's death, the brahmin would go to the cemetery and walk round the heap of ashes, moaning piteously.  The deva visited him and admonished him, as in the story of Mattakundali.  The brahmin followed his advice and gave up his grief.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a rich landowner of Sāvatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha, who lost his son.  The Buddha, knowing of his great grief, visited him in the company of Ananda and preached to him.  At the conclusion of the sermon, the landowner became a sotāpanna.

He was governor of Dakkhinadesa.  He was later found guilty of an offence in the women's apartments of the palace and was treacherously killed by the court officers.  Cv.xliv.84,123f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Māna.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest son of Kassapa II.  (Cv.xlv.6) His full name was Mānavamma.  (Regarding these names, Māna and Mānavamma, see Cv.  Trs.i.192, n.  3.).  He was very young when his father died, and, when the government fell into the hands of Dappula I.  and later of Dāthopatissa II., he left Uttaradesa, where he was living in retirement with his wife Sanghā, and went to Jambudīpa, there to take service under the Pallava king, Narasīha (for details see Cv.xivii.9ff., 15ff).  He won the king's favor and very loyally helped him to defeat the Vallabha king.  He then raised an army with the help of Narasīha, landed in Ceylon, and recovered the kingdom from Dāthopatissa.  But later his army deserted him on hearing tidings of Narasīha's illness and Māna returned once more to Jambudīpa.  Some time after he came again to Ceylon with a large army and defeated Hatthadātha, the reigning king, and his general Potthakuttha.  In the confusion which followed, Hatthadātha was killed and Potthakuttha was poisoned at Merukandara.  Māna thereupon became king and did many acts of merit, including the erection of the Padhānarakkha and the Sirisanghabodhi vihāras, also the Sepanni and Siri pāsādas.  Māna was a supporter of the Pamsukūlins.  Cv.xlvii.1ff.  Mānavamma reigned circa 676 711 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Māna &lt;/b&gt; (also called Mānavamma).  He was the nephew of Kassapa II.  and the son of Dappula I.  Kassapa handed over the kingdom to him at the time of his death, his own children being very young.  When Kassapa died, the Damilas attacked Ceylon, but Māna, with his father's help, repulsed them and crowned his father king.  When Hatthadātha heard of this, he came with a large force and seized the throne under the name of Dāthopatissa II.  Māna went to the Eastern Province, while Dappula returned to Rohana.  Later, Māna led a rebellion against Dāthopatissa and was killed in battle (Cv.xlv.1ff.; 52, 77ff).  His mother was the sister of Kassapa II.  and the daughter of King Silāmeghavanna.  Cv.  Trs.i.94, n.  1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Māna.&lt;/b&gt; Called Mūlapotthakī.  He was an officer of Parakkamabāhu I.  and, in one campaign, defeated Lokagalla Vikkama at Mahāgāma.

Mallikā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"&gt;Mallikā&lt;/a&gt; visits the Buddha and asks him why some women are beautiful, others plain, some rich, others poor.  The Buddha explains that if a woman be ill tempered and irritable, jealous and slow to give alms, such a one becomes poor and of ill favour, wherever she may happen to be born.  A woman, however, who never becomes angry or agitated even under great provocation, and is generous, such a one becomes beautiful and rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā declares her determination for the future, to be gentle in temper, never revengeful or harbouring a grudge, but always amiable and generous.  A.ii.202ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mallikā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; asks &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"&gt;Mallikā&lt;/a&gt;, as they sit on the upper terrace of the palace, if anyone is dearer to her than her own "self "; she says "No one." He says that the same is true of him, but is evidently piqued, for he seeks the Buddha; the Buddha tells him that Mallikā has spoken truly and well.  S.i.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahilāmukha Jātaka (No.  26)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta, king of Benares, owned a state elephant, called Mahilāmukha, who was gentle and good.  One day thieves sat down outside his stable and started talking of their plans for robbery, and murder.  Several days in succession this happened, until at last, by dint of listening to them, Mahilāmukha became cruel and began to kill his keepers.  The king sent his minister, the Bodhisatta, to investigate the matter.  He discovered what had happened, and made good men sit outside the stables who talked of various virtues.  The elephant regained his former goodness and gentleness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who was persuaded by a friend to eat at the monastery of Gayāsīsa, built for Devadatta by Ajātuattu.  The monk would steal off there at the hour of the meal and then return to Veluvana.  After some time his guilty secret was discovered, and he was admonished by the Buddha.  He is identified with Mahilāmukha and the king with Ananda.  J.i.185 8; see also Giridanta and Manoja Jātakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahisa Jātaka (No.  278).  The Bodhisatta, was born once as a buffalo in Himavā.  One day, as he stood under a tree, a monkey fouled him, and taking hold of his horn pulled him about.  But the buffalo showed no resentment.  This happened several times, and on being asked by the spirit of the tree why he endured it, the buffalo answered that it was by virtue of his goodness.  Later the monkey tried his games on another buffalo, who killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monkey who, in the same way, fouled an elephant of Sāvatthi and escaped unhurt owing to the patience of the elephant.  On another day a fierce elephant came from the stables and the monkey was trampled to death.  J.i.385 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

His younger sister was married to the Nāga on Vaddhamānapabbata and her son was Cūlodara.  There was a war between uncle and nephew regarding a gem set throne, and it was to settle this dispute that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon.  Mhv.i.45ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Ninety four kappas ago he was an ascetic, and, having seen the Buddha (? Padumuttara), gave him a jewelled seat.  Twelve kappas ago he was king eight times under the name of Sataramsī.  Ap.i.190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Manipūjaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  He was once a Nāga king in a lake in Himavā, and, having seen Padumuttara Buddha travelling through the air, he offered him the jewel which he wore round his throat, that being the only thing he had (Ap.ii.413f).

He was fourteen at the time of the coronation of his father and was ordained at the age of twenty, his preceptor being Moggaliputtatissa.  The ordination was performed by Mahādeva, while Majjhantika recited the kammavācā.  Mahinda became an arahant on the day of his ordination (Mhv.v.204ff.; Dpv.v.24 f ; Sp.i.51).  He spent three years in study of the Doctrine under his preceptor, and, later, when the latter retired to Ahogangā, he left his one thousand disciples for seven years under the care of Mahinda (Mhv.v.233; Sp.i.52).  When the Third Council was held, Mahinda had been for twelve years a monk and was charged with the mission of converting Ceylon.  But he delayed for six months, until Devānampiyatissa became king.  He then went to Dakkhināgiri and from there to his birthplace, Vedisagiri, staying in Vedisagiri vihāra and visiting his mother, the queen Devī.  Still one more month he tarried, teaching the Doctrine to Bhanduka, and then, on the full moon day of Jettha, at the request of Sakka, he went, in company with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Itthiya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uttiya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sambala, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bhaddasāla, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sumanasāmanera and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bhanduka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;to Ceylon, where he converted Devānampiyatissa by preaching to him the Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta.  Later, on the same day, he preached the Samacitta Sutta.  The next day, at the request of the king, he visited Anurādhapura, travelling through the air and alighting on the site of the (later) Pathamacetiya.  After a meal at the palace he preached the Petavatthu, the Vimānavatthu and the Sacca Samyutta, and Anulā and her five hundred companions became sotāpannas.  Later, in the elephant stables, he preached the Devadūta Sutta to the assembled people, and, in the evening, the Bālapandita Sutta, in Nandanavana.  The night he spent in Mahāmeghavana, and on the next day the king gave the park to Mahinda, on behalf of the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda pointed out to the king various spots destined to be connected with the growth of the sāsana in Ceylon, offering flowers at the same, and at the site of the (later) Mahā Thūpa, he described the visits of the Four Buddhas of this kappa to Ceylon.  On the fourth day he preached the Anamatagga Sutta in Nandanavana and helped the king in defining the boundaries of what later became the Mahāvihāra.  On the fifth day he preached the Khajjanīya Sutta, on the sixth the Gomayapindī sutta, and on the seventh the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pāsāda first built for the residence of Mahinda was called Kālapāsāda parivena.  Other buildings associated with him were the Sunhātaparivena, the Dīghacanka parivena, the Phalagga parivena, the Therāpassaya parivena, the Marugana-parivena, and the Dīghasandasenāpati-parivena.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty six days Mahinda stayed in Mahāmeghavana, and on the thirteenth day of the bright half of Āsālha, after having preached the Mahāppamāda Sutta, he went to Missakapabbata, to spend the vassa.  The king had sixty eight rock cells built in the mountain and gave them to the theras on the full moon day.  On the same day Mahinda ordained sixty two monks, who attained arahantship, at Tumbarumālaka.  After the full moon day of Kattika, at the conclusion of the pavārana ceremony, Mahinda held a consultation with Devānampiyatissa and sent Sumanasāmanera to Pātaliputta to bring the relics of the Buddha from Dhammāsoka and other relics from Sakka.  These relics were brought and placed on the Missakapabbata, which from then onwards was called Cetiyegiri.  The collar bone from among the relics was deposited in the Thūpārāma (q.v.), which was built for the purpose.  It was at Mahinda's suggestion that Devānampiyatissa sent an embassy headed by Mahāarittha to Asoka, with a request that Sanghamittā should come to Ceylon with a branch of the Bodhi tree.  The request was granted, and Sanghamittā arrived in Ceylon with the branch.  Devānampiyatissa, during the later part of his reign, acting on the advice of Mahinda, built numerous vihāras, each one yojana from the other; among them were Issarasamanaka and Vessagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda is said to have taught the Commentaries to the Tipitaka in, the Singhalese language, after translating them from the Pāli (Cv.xxxvii.228ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapāsādikā (pp.  102ff ) mentions a recital held by Mahinda under the presidency of Mahāarittha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda continued to live for the first eight years of the reign of Uttiya, who succeeded Devānampiyatissa.  Then, at the age of sixty, he died on the eighth day of the bright half of Assayuja, in Cetiyagiri, where he was spending the rainy season.  His body was brought in procession, with every splendor and honour, to the Mahāvihāra and placed in the Pañhambamālaka, where homage was paid to it for a whole week.  It was then burnt on a pyre of fragrant wood on the east of the Therānambandhamālaka, to the left of the site of the Mahā Thūpa.  A cetiya was erected on that spot over half the remains, the other half being distributed in thūpas built on Cetiyagiri and elsewhere.  The place of cremation was called Isibhūmangana, and there for many centuries were cremated the remains of holy men who lived within a distance of three yojanas.( For details of Mahinda see Mhv.xiii.  xx; Dpv.vii.57f., xii., xiii., iv.: xv.; Sp.i.61, 69ff., 79ff., 83ff., 90ff., 103, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, King Sirimeghavanip had a life size image of Mahinda made of gold; this he took to the Ambatthalacetiya.  For eight days a festival was held in its honour; on the ninth day the image was taken from Ambatthala, carried by the king himself at the head of a large and splendid procession, and placed for three days in Sotthiyākara vihāra.  On the twelfth day it was taken with all splendours to Anurādhapura, to the Mahāvihāra, where it was left for three months in the courtyard of the Bodhi tree.  From there it was removed to the inner city and deposited in a magnificent image house to the south east of the palace.  An endowment was set up for the annual performance of ceremonies in honour of the image, and this custom was continued for many centuries.  The image was brought from the inner town to the (Mahā)vihāra on the pavārana day, and every year an offering was made on the thirteenth day (Cv.xxxvii.66ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhātusena had the image brought to the place where Mahinda's body was cremated and there held a great festival (Cv.xxxviii.58), while Aggabodhi I.  set up the image on the banks of the tank called Mahindatata, and ensured that the special task of carrying the image to the dyke of the tank was the task of the Taracchas.  Cv.xlii.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; See Indra (=Sakka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; King, father of Phussa Buddha (AA.i.165; SA.iii.4; DhA.i.84).  Elsewhere he is called Jayasena.  See Phussa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahinda.  &lt;/b&gt; A king of old, descendant of Mahāsammata, and last of a dynasty which ruled at Rojanagara.  Twelve of his sons and grandsons ruled in Campā.  Dpv.iii.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahinda I.  &lt;/b&gt; Brother of Kassapa III.  and king of Ceylon (724 27 A.C.).  He refused to be crowned, out of sorrow for the death of his friend Nīla, and administered the government as ādipāda.  He thus came to be known as Adipāda Mahinda.  His brother's son, Aggabodhi, was his viceroy, while his own son was made ruler of Dakkhinadesa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave ten cartloads of food to the Mahāpāli and would eat nothing without first giving of it to beggars.  He built a nunnery for the bhikkhunīs (called Mahindaupassaya) and gave to it the village of Nagaragalla.  He also built the Mahindatata vihāra.  Cv.xiviii.26ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Aggabodhi VII.  He was made viceroy, but died young.  Cv.xlviii.69, 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Silāmegha (Aggabodhi VI.) (Cv.xlviii.42, 76).  Aggabodhi made him senāpati and gave over the government to him.  But when Aggabodhi VI.  died and Aggabodhi VII.  came to the throne, Mahinda went to Mahātittha.  Later, on the death of Aggabodhi VII., Mahinda quelled all disturbances and put the queen in chains because she conspired to kill him.  His cousin Dappula rose against him, but was defeated after much fighting.  Mahinda then married the queen of Aggabodhi VI.  and became king as Mahinda II., when a son was born to him.  Dappula again rose in revolt, but Mahinda made a treaty with him and gave him part of Rohana with the Gālhagangā as boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Mahinda's benefactions was the erection of the Dāmavihāra-parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra in Pulatthipura, also the costly Ratanapāsāda, containing a golden image of the Buddha.  To the Silāmegha nunnery Mahinda gave a silver Bodhisatta statue.  He had the Abhidhamma recited by the monks of Hemasāli Vihāra, and built many shrines and helped those who were poor or in trouble.  To the lame he gave bulls and to the Damilas horses.  He strengthened the weir of the Kālavāpi.  He reigned for twenty years (772 92 A.C.) and was succeeded by his son Udaya I.  (Cv.xlviii.83ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of the Adipāda Dāthāsīva of Rohana.  He quarreled with his father, took service under Udaya I.  and married his daughter Devā.  He was later sent to Rohana, where he drove out his father.  His two sons revolted against him, and, with Udaya's help, led an army against him.  Mahinda defeated them, but was killed in a fight with another kinsman.  Cv.xlix.10ff.; 66ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Udaya I.; he was, however, known by the name of Dhammikasilāmegha and was a very pious man.  He gave the income from the Getthumba Canal to be used in repairs of the Ratanapāsāda.  He became king as Mahinda III.  and reigned for four years (797 801 A.C.).  Cv.xlix.38ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Mahinda.  &lt;/b&gt; Son of Mahinda III.  When Aggabodhi IX.  came to the throne, contrary to the laws of succession, Mahinda fled to India (Cv.xlix.84f).  He was afterwards slain by Sena I.  (Cv.l.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Younger brother of Sena I.  and his viceroy.  He quelled the rising of Udaya against the king, his brother.  When the Pandu king invaded Ceylon, Mahinda led an army against him, and, on the defeat of his forces, he cut his own throat.  Cv.l.  6, 10, 21ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana.  He was killed by Kittaggabodhi's sister.  Cv.l.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of the Adipāda Kassapa and brother of Sena II.  He married Tissā and Kitti.  He became viceroy under Sena II.  and ruled in Dakkhinadesa.  Later he was discovered guilty of an intrigue in the king's harem, and fled, unrecognized, with his family, to Malaya.  Afterwards, however, he regained his honors and continued as viceroy, his daughter Sanghā being married to Kassapa, son of Sena II.  Mahinda built a temple under the Bodhi tree, and, in the course of its construction, a workman discovered that one of the beams would harm a branch of the tree.  Mahinda, on being informed of this, came and made a saccakiriyā, as a result of which the branch of the tree straightened itself during the night, leaving the building free.  Mahinda also built the Mahindasena parivena, and died in the twenty third year of Sena's reign (Cv.l.59; li.7, 13, 15ff., 53ff).  Adipāda Kittaggabodhi was his Son.  Ibid., 94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Kassapa V., and brother of Sena II.  and Sanghā.  When the Adipāda Kittaggabodhi raised a rebellion in Rohana against Udaya II., the latter sent Mahinda to quell it with the help of the general Vajiragga.  The expedition was completely successful and Kittaggabodhi taken prisoner.  Mahinda stayed in Mahāgāma and ruled over Rohana justly and well.  Among his works was the construction of a dam across the Mahānadī (Cv.li.99ff).  When Kassapa IV.  became king, Mahinda revolted against him, but the king, through the influence of Mahinda's father, persuaded him to desist.  Later, Mahinda returned to Anurādhapura at the request of the monks, and, after having married the king's daughter, went back to Rohana, where, evidently, he died.  Cv.lii.4ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Viceroy of Sena IV.  and probably his brother.  He afterwards became king as Mahinda IV.  (956 72 A.C.).  He married a Kālinga princess.  During his reign, the Vallabha king invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the general Sena and entered into a treaty with Mahinda.  Mahinda showed great favour to the Pamsukulikas and the Lābhavāsins and decreed that the incomes derived from vihāras should not be taxed.  His good acts were many.  He had a Commentary to the Abhidhamma written by the Thera Dhammamitta in the Sitthagāma-parivena and the Abhidhamma recited by the Thera Dāthānāga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made great offerings at the Mahā Thūpa and started to build the Candanapāsāda, where he had preserved the Hair Relic of the Buddha.  He restored the temple of the four cetiyas in Padalañchana as well as the Temple of the Tooth, the Dhammasanganigeha and the Mahāpāli.  He built the Mahāmallaka for the Theravāda nuns and completed the Manipāsāda.  Mahinda's wife was Kittī (q.n), who, herself, engaged in various works.  Their son was Sena (Sena V.).  Cv.liv.1ff.; Cv.  Trs.i.178, n.  2; 179, n.  2; 183, n.  2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Younger brother of Sena V.  He succeeded Sena as Mahinda V.  and ruled for ten years at Anurādhapura under great difficulties.  He was weak and powerless, and the Kerala soldiers in his employ mutinied for better salaries.  Mahinda escaped to Rohana by means of an underground passage, and lived at Sīdupabbatagāma with his brother's wife as queen, later marrying his brother's daughter.  Their son was Kassapa, and afterwards they lived in Kappagallaka.  In the thirty sixth year of Mahinda's reign, the Colas, taking advantage of the discontent in Ceylon, invaded the country, capturing the king, the queen, and all the royal regalia.  They ruled for many years with Pulatthinagara as base, and Mahinda died in Cola after a captivity lasting for twelve years (Cv.iv.1ff).  Lokitā and Devalā were his maternal cousins.  Cv.lvii.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Mahinda&lt;/b&gt;.  Son of Moggallāna and Lokitā and brother of Kiti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.).  Cv.lvii.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Vikkamabāhu II.  and brother of Gajabahu.  He fought against Deva, general of Parakkamabāhu I,, at Hedillakhandagāma, but was defeated, and fled to Billagāma.  From there he went to Vallitittha, and was again defeated.  Later he joined Mānābharana, and was sent by him to Moravāpi, thence to Anurādhapura, where he defeated Mahālekha Rakkha and Bhandārapotthakī, who marched against him.  From Anurādhapura, Mahinda proceeded to Kālavāpi where, for three months, he fought against Bhandārapotthakī Bhūta, and was finally defeated by him.  This is the last we hear of him.  Cv.lxii.59; lxxii.46, 82, 123ff., 176ff., 191f., 198ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; An officer of Kittisirimegha, sent by him to fetch the young Parakkamabāhu.  Cv.lxvi.  66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; A Lambakanna in the Morya district, an officer of Parakkamabāhu I.  He was a Nagaragiri, and was sent by Parakkamabāhu to Mallavālāna, where he conducted a victorious campaign against Uttararattha.  Later he took Anurādhapura, and was one of those responsible for the capture of Gajabāhu at Pulatthipura.  Cv.lxix.  13; lxx.  89, 146ff.; 158, 199ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. Mahinda Mahālekha.&lt;/b&gt; An officer of Mānābharana.  He was defeated by the Kesadhāttu Rakkha at Sarogāmatittha and again by the troops of Parakkamabāhu I.  at Janapada.  Cv.lxxii.Iff., 166.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; A minister and kinsman of Parakkamabāhu I.  He lived in the palace and erected at Pulatthipura a pāsāda for the Tooth Relic.  Cv.lxxiii.124ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; A man of the Kulinga clan, whose wife was a cowherd's daughter called Dīpanī.  He killed Vijayabāhu II.  and reigned for five days, but was slain by Kittinissanka.  Cv.lxxx.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;24. Mahinda.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Sumanadevī and Bodhigutta.  He came among the escort of the Bodhi tree.  Devānampiyatissa conferred on him the rank of Cullajayamahālekhaka.  Mbv.169.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manikantha Jātaka (No.  253)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta and his younger brother, after the death of their parents, lived as ascetics in leaf huts on the Ganges, the elder being higher up the stream than the younger.  One day, the Nāga king Manikantha, while walking along the river in the guise of a man, came to the hut of the younger ascetic and became his friend.  Thereafter he called daily and their friendship grew apace.  Manikantha finally became so fond of the ascetic that he put off his disguise, and encircling the other in his folds, lay thus for a short while each day, until his affection was satisfied.  But the ascetic was afraid of his Nāga shape and grew thin and pale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta noticing this, suggested that the next time Manikantha came, his brother should ask for the jewel which he wore round his throat.  On the morrow, when the ascetic made this request, Manikantha hurried away.  Several times this happened, and then he came no more.  The ascetic was much grieved by his absence, but was comforted by the Bodhisiatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related this story at the Aggālava-cetiya near Alavi.  The monks of Alavi became so importunate with their requests for building materials from the householders that at the mere sight of a monk the householders would hurry indoors.  Mahā Kassapa discovered this and reported it to the Buddha, who admonished the monks against begging for things from other people.  J.ii.282 6; also Vin.iii.146f., where the details of the story of the past are slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same occasion were preached the Brahmadatta Jātaka and the Atthisena Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mangala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Mangala&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third of the twenty four Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas ago in the Uttaramadhura Park, in the city of Uttara, his father being a khattiya named Uttara and his mother Uttarā.  It is said that from the day of her conception, an aura shed its rays night and day from her body, to a distance of eighty hands - hence his name.  He surpassed other Buddhas in glory of body.  In his last birth as a human being (corresponding to that of Vessantara in the case of Gotama) he lived with his family as an ascetic.  A man eating yakkha, named Kharadāthika, took from him his two children and ate them in his presence, "crunching them as though they were yams," while the blood dripped from his mouth.  (It is probably this incident, which is referred to at J.iv.13).  The Bodhisatta stood firm in his resolve and repented not of his gift to the yakkha, but registered a desire that in future births his body should emit light as bright as the blood which flowed down the yakkha's face.  In a previous birth, Mangala paid honour to the cetiya of a Buddha by wrapping his body in cloth drenched with oil, setting fire to it and walking round the cetiya throughout the night, carrying on his head a golden bowl filled with scented oil and lighted with one thousand wicks.  Not a hair on his body suffered damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nine thousand years Mangala lived in the household in three palaces, Yasavā, Sucimā and Sirimā, with his wife Yasavatī, by whom he had one son, Sīvala.  He left the world on a horse and practised austerities for eight months.  Just before his Enlightenment he ate a meal of milk rice given by a maiden, Uttarā, daughter of Uttarasetthi in Uttaragāma; an Ājīvaka, named Uttara, gave him grass for his seat.  His Bodhi was a Nāga tree.  After his Enlightenment he lived for ninety thousand years, and for all that time the aura from his body spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, shutting out sun, moon and stars.  People knew the times and the seasons by the cries of the birds and the blooming of the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangala's first sermon was preached in the Sirivaruttama Grove, near Sirivaddha.  His chief disciples among men were Sudeva and Dhammasena, and his chief nuns Sīvalā and Asokā.  Pālita was his constant attendant (BuA.124 calls him Uttara).  Nanda and Visākha were his chief patrons among lay men and Anulā and Sutanā among lay women.  In Mangala's time the Bodhisatta was the brahmin Suruci (q.v.).  Mangala's body was eighty cubits high; he held three assemblies: the first at the preaching of the Dhammacakka, the second at Cittanagara, when he preached to Sunanda, king of Surabhinagara, and his son Anurāja, and the third at Mekhala to Sudeva and Dhammasena who later became his chief disciples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died in the park of Vessara, and a cetiya, thirty leagues high, was erected over his ashes (Bu.iv.1ff.; BuA.115ff.; J.i.30 ff.; the particulars found in Mtu.i.248 50, are slightly different).  It is said (Bu.iv.29) that all Mangala Buddha's personal disciples attained arahantship before their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mangala.  &lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta born as an ascetic in the time of Dhammadassī Buddha.  J.i.40; but Bu.xvi.9 says he was then born as Sakka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mangala.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta born as an ascetic in the time of Siddhattha Buddha (Bu.xvii.8; M.T.62).  He was a very rich brahmin of Surasena, and later gave away all his wealth and became an ascetic.  On one occasion, by his iddhi power, he obtained fruit which grew on the jambu tree (which gave its name to Jambudīpa) and offered it at the Surasena vihāra to Siddhattha Buddha and ninety crores of monks.  BuA.187.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mangala Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  He was present at the Foundation-ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Dpv.xix.8).

In reply to Ananda's question, he tells him the story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makhadeva,Makhādeva')"&gt;Makhādeva&lt;/a&gt;, of how he renounced the world when gray hairs appeared on his head and became a recluse, enjoining on his eldest son to do likewise when the time came.  Makhādeva developed the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/brahma_vihaara,Brahmavihārā')"&gt;Brahmavihārā&lt;/a&gt; and was reborn in the Brahma world.  Eighty four thousand of his descendants, in unbroken succession, followed the tradition set by him; the last of the kings to do this was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi,Nimi')"&gt;Nimi&lt;/a&gt;, and his virtue having been remarked by the gods of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; invited him there.  Nimi accepted the invitation, but later returned to earth to rule righteously and to observe the four fast days in each month.  Nimi's son was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalaarajanaka,Kālārajanaka')"&gt;Kālārajanaka&lt;/a&gt;, who broke the high tradition and proved the last of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makhādeva's tradition led only to the Brahma world, but the teachings of the Buddha lead to Enlightenment and Nibbāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makhādeva is identified with the Buddha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manisūkāra Jātaka (No.  285)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta lived in the Himālaya as an ascetic, and near his hut was a crystal cave in which lived thirty boars.  A lion used to range near the cave in which his shadow was reflected.  This so terrified the boars that one day, they fetched mud from a neighbouring pool with which they rubbed the crystal; but because of the boars' bristles, the more they rubbed, the brighter grew the crystal.  In despair they consulted the Bodhisatta, who told them that a crystal could not be sullied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an unsuccessful attempt by the heretics to accuse the Buddha of having seduced Sundarī (q.v.) and then brought about her death.  J.ii.415-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātali&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the chariot driver (sahgāhaka) of Sakka.  The Mātali of the present age had a son, Sikhandhi, with whom Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, daughter of Timbarū, was in love; but later she transferred her affections to Pañcasikha (D.ii.268).  Mātali is Sakka's constant companion and accompanies him everywhere, more as a confidant than as a servant.  See, e.g., the conversation reported at S.i.221, 224, 234ff.; and Vv.iv.  9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, he was by Sakka's side in the war against the Asuras and drove his chariot when he fled with his bride Sujātā.  The chariot is called Vejayanta ratha and is drawn by one thousand Sindh horses (DhA.i.279f.; J.i.202f).  Mātali often accompanied Sakka on his journeys to the world of men, changing his form e.g., to that of a fish in the Culladhanuggaha Jātaka, a brahmin in the Bilārakosiya Jātaka and in the Suddhābhojana Jātaka, and a big black dog in the Mahākanha Jātaka.  On several occasions he was sent by Sakka to fetch human beings to Tāvatimsa e.g., Guttila, Nimi, Makhādeva and Sādhīna and he proved an excellent guide, pointing out to the visitors the places of interest passed on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha descended from Tāvatimsa, after preaching there the Abhidhamma, he was accompanied, on the left, by Mātali, offering celestial scents, garlands and flowers (DhA.iii.226).  Both in the Bilārakosiya and the Sudhābhojana Jātakas (q.v.) Mātali is spoken of as the son of Suriya.  Ananda is said to have been Mātali during several lives (J.i.206; iv.180; v.  412; vi.129); so also Mahā Kassapa (J.iv.69).  In the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.258), Mātali is described as a Gandhabba chief, while in the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.204) he is mentioned among the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in time of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maricavatti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cetiya in Anurādhapura and a monastic building attached to it.  The cetiya was built by Dutthagāmanī on the spot where the king's spear, containing the Buddha's relic given to him by the monks (Mhv.xxv.1), was planted, when Dutthagāmanī went to the Tissavāpī for his ceremonial bathing after his consecration.  When the king's men attempted to remove the spear they found it impossible, and the king, after consultation with the monks, decided to build a cetiya enclosing the spot with a vihāra attached.  The work was completed in three years and a great ceremony of dedication was held, the building and the ceremony costing nineteen crores.  The vihāra was called Maricavatti because it was intended by the king as expiation for having once eaten a pepper pod (maricavatti) without sharing it with the monks, thus violating the vow of his childhood.  For the building of the vihāra, see Mhv.xxvi.1ff.; the vow is mentioned at Mhv.xxii.80; the Dpv.  makes no mention of Maricavatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vohārika Tissa renovated the vihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.33, 36), while Gothābhaya built an uposatha hall (Mhv.xxxvi.107) and Vasabha provided a mantling for the thūpa (Mhv.xxxv.121).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa II.  built a pāsāda in the vihāra and gave it to the Thera who, at one time, lived in Nāgasālā (Cv.xliv.149).  Kassapa IV.  entrusted the care of the Bodhi tree at Maricavatti to the bhikkhunīs at the Tissārāma, which he built for them (Cv.lii.24), while Kassapa V.  restored the whole vihāra, gave it to the Theravādins and granted five hundred maintenance villages (Cv.lii.45).  Devā, mother of Sakkasenāpati, provided a diadem jewel for the Buddha image in the vihāra, also a halo, an umbrella and a garment (Cv.lii.65).  Dappula III.  gave a maintenance village to the vihāra (Cv.liii.2), while Mahinda IV.  started to build in it a pāsāda called Candana, which does not seem to have been completed (Cv.liv.40).  Parakkamabāhu I.  found the thūpa destroyed by the Damilas and rebuilt it to the height of eighty cubits (Cv.lxxviii.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Matakabhatta Jātaka (No.  18)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a brahmin, well versed in the Vedas, wished to slay a goat at the Feast of the Dead (Matakabhatta), and sent his pupils to bathe the goat in the river.  After the bath, the goat remembered its past lives and knew that after its death that day it would be free from misery.  So it laughed for joy.  But it saw also that the brahmin, through slaying it, would suffer great misery, and this thought made it weep.  On being questioned as to the reason for its laughing and its weeping, it said the answer would be given before the brahmin.  When the brahmin heard the goat's story, he resolved not to kill him; but that same day, while the goat was browsing near a rock, the rock was struck by lightning and a large splinter cut off the goat's head.  The Bodhisatta, who was a tree sprite, saw all this and preached the Law to the assembled multitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a question by the monks as to whether there was any good at all in offering sacrifices as Feasts for the Dead, which the people of Sāvatthi were in the habit of doing.  J.i.166ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maccarī Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Maccarī Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  On the five disadvantages of staying too long in one place - one grudges sharing one's lodging, the families who provide alms, one's provisions, one's fame, or the Dhamma.  A.iii.258.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Maccharī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk who grudges sharing his lodging, the families who provide him with food, the gifts he receives, his fame, and who frustrates gifts offered in faith - such a monk is destined to hell.  A.iii.266.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Maccharī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The same as the above except that the fifth quality is given as stinginess with regard to Dhamma.  A.iii.266f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Maccharī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The same as (3) except that "nun" is substituted for "monk." A.iii.139.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Macharī Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  A group of Satullapa devas visit the Buddha at Jetavana and four of them speak, each one verse, before him on the evils of avarice and the blessings of generosity.  The Buddha utters a verse to the effect that gifts given should be well gotten.  S.i.18f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Maccharī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A deva visits the Buddha and asks him questions as to what kind of person is a miser and what awaits the generous man.  The Buddha replies.  S.i.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Maccharī Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Seven fetters must be destroyed in order that the good life may be led: complying, resisting, wrong views, uncertainty, conceit, envy, meanness.

See the Mātanga Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mātanga.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.70; ApA.i.107).  He was the last of the Pacceka Buddhas and lived near Rājagaha.  At the last birth of the Bodhisatta the devas, on their way to do him honour, saw Mātanga and told him, "Sir, the Buddha has appeared in the world." Mātanga heard this as he was issuing from a trance, and, going to Mount Mahāpapāta where&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;Pacceka Buddhas die, he passed away.  ApA.i.170; SNA.i.128f; Mtu.i.357.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mātanga.&lt;/b&gt; A hermit.  One day he arrived in Benares and went to a potter's hall for the night.  He found the place already occupied by another hermit named Jātimā, and was told by the potter that he could only stay there with Jātimā's permission.  Jātimā agreed to his staying, but, on finding that Mātanga was a candāla, he wished him to occupy a place apart.  During the night Mātanga wished to go out, and, not knowing where Jātimā was lying, trod on his chest.  When Mātanga returned he took the other way with the idea of passing near Jātimā's feet, but meanwhile Jātimā had changed his position, and Mātanga again trod on his chest.  Jātimā thereupon cursed him, saying that his head would split in seven pieces at sunrise.  Mātanga thereupon stopped the sun from rising (SA.ii.176f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is as in the Mātanga Jātaka.  It may be a variety of the same legend.  cp.  also Nārada and Devala.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mātanga&lt;/b&gt;.  Father of Mātangaputta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makasa Jātaka (No.  44)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in a border village in Kāsi, there lived a number of carpenters.  One day, one of them, a bald, grey-haired man, was planing some wood when a mosquito settled on his head and stung him.  He asked his son who was sitting by to drive it away.  The boy raised an axe, and meaning to drive away the mosquito, cleft his father's head in two, killing him.  The Bodhisatta, a trader, saw this incident.  " Better an enemy with sense than such a friend," said he.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some inhabitants of a hamlet in Magadha who were worried by mosquitoes when working in the jungle.  One day they armed themselves with arrows, and while trying to shoot the mosquitoes, shot each other.  The Buddha saw them outside the village greatly disabled because of their folly.  J.i.246 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhupindīka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Siddhartha Buddha he was a hunter, and, meeting the Buddha in the forest, he offered him a honey cake, when he rose from samādhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty four kappas ago he was king four times under the name of Sudassana, and at his birth showers of honey fell.  Ap.i.136f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mānava Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a rich brahmin family of Sāvatthi.  When on his way to the park one day, at the age of seven, he saw, for the first time, persons afflicted with old age, disease, and death.  These filled him with horror, and he went to the monastery, heard the Buddha preach, and, with his parents' consent, entered the Order.  He was called "Mānava" because he left the world so young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a physiognomist, and, having seen the child, declared that he would certainly become a Buddha, and worshipped him.  In subsequent lives he became king many times under the names of Sammukhāthavika, Pathavīdundubhi, Obhāsa, Sadinacchedana, Agginibbāpaka, Vātamma, Gatipacchedana, Ratanapajjala, Padakkamana, Vilokana and Girisāra (ThagA.vs.73; ThagA.i.162ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Sammukhāthavika Thera of the Apadāna.

Culla Kāla and Mahā Kāla, the youngest and the oldest, used to travel about with caravans and procure goods, which were sold for them by Majjhima Kāla.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had four crores.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhura Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Madhura Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Avantiputta, king of Madhurā, visits Mahā Kaccāna, who is staying at the Gundāvana in Madhurā, some time after the Buddha's death, and questions him regarding the brahmin claims to superiority over other castes.  Kaccāna points out that wealth confers power on all, not only on brahmins.  A brahmin experiences the result of his actions both good and bad, in this world and in the next, just as do members of other castes.  A brahmin ascetic receives no more homage than an ascetic of other castes.  Avantiputta accepts the Buddha's Faith.  M.ii.83 90; cp.  Ambattha Sutta; for a discussion see Dial.i.105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Madhura Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; On the five disadvantages of Madhurā: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ground is uneven, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there is much dust, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;there are fierce dogs and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bestial yakkhas, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;alms are obtained with difficulty (A.iii.256).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (AA.ii.646) that the Buddha, during a tour, once entered Madhurā, and was on his way to the inner city.  But a certain heretic yakkhinī stood before him naked, stretching out her arms, her tongue out.  The Buddha thereupon turned back and went to the vihāra, where the people entertained him and the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manoharī&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king of Thaton who later became a vassal of Anorata of Burma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that flames issued from his mouth when he spoke, till Anorata made him eat food taken from a holy shrine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manoharī, confounded by the loss of his power, sold a gem and erected two great images of the Buddha.

Maranasati Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells the monks at Nādika that mindfulness of death, if properly cultivated, leads to great advantages.  Various monks thereupon claim that they practise such mindfulness, but the Buddha tells them their practice is not sufficiently diligent and instructs them how to improve it.  A.iv.317f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Maranasati Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Preached at Nādika.  A monk must ever remember that death may overtake him at any instant.

A conversation between him and Dhanuggahatissa it was which, overheard by Pasenadi's spies, led to Pasenadi changing his tactics and defeating Ajātasattu.  J.iv.343; but see J.ii.403, where Dhanuggatissa's companion is called Utta, which is probably a wrong reading of Datta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the conversation Mantidatta is addressed as Datta, which was evidently his personal name, the prefix Manti being given him as the king's minister and to distinguish him from other Dattas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mandhātā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primeval king, descended from Mahāsammata, Roja, Vararoja, Kalyāna, Varakalyāna and Uposatha, the last named being his father.  He was thus an ancestor of the Sākiyans.  J.ii.311; iii.454; Mtu.ii.2; Dpv.iii.5; but see SNA.i.352, where the genealogy is slightly different.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had the seven Jewels of a Cakka-vatti and his four Supernatural Powers.  When he clenched his left hand and touched it with his right, a shower of the seven kinds of jewels fell knee deep from the sky.  For eighty four thousand years he was a prince, for eighty four thousand a viceroy, and for eighty four thousand more a king.  His life span was an asankheyya.  But he grew discontented, and, at the suggestion of his ministers, visited the deva world.  First he went to the Cātummahārājika world, where he ruled; but still unsatisfied, he went to Tāvatimsa.  There Sakka welcomed him and gave him half his kingdom.  Mandhātā ruled there during the lifetime of thirty six Sakkas, each Sakka's life lasting for thirty six million years and sixty times one hundred thousand.  As time went on, Mandhātā's craving increased; he wished to kill Sakka and gain the whole kingdom.  Because of his greed his power waned, and he fell from heaven into his park.  The gardener announced his arrival to the royal family, and they provided a resting place for him and there he lay dying.  When asked for a message for his people, he wished them to know how even he, in spite of his great pomp and power, had to die (J.ii.311ff.; DA.ii.481f.; MA.i.182f.; cp.  Dvy.210ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandhātā is identified with the Bodhisatta (J.ii.314).  His son was Varamandhātā, whose son was Cara and grandson Upacara (or Apacara) (J.iii.454; Dpv.iii.6).  Mandhātā ruled at Rājagaha (SNA.ii.413; DA.i.132), and is named as one of the four persons who attained, while yet in their earthly bodies, to the glory of the gods.  Mil.  115, 291; MA.ii.737f.; the others being Guttila, Sādhīna and Nimi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is considered as chief of those given up to the pleasures of the senses and as an example of one whose desires could never be satisfied.  A.ii.17; AA.ii.474; e.g., VibhA.506. Thig.486.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mandhātā went to the deva world he was accompanied by inhabitants of all the four continents.  After his return to earth, however, the Cakkaratana, stuck fast in the ground, and the others could not return to their homes.  They thereupon begged for the intervention of the minister (Parināyaka), who was carrying on the government with Mandhātā's shoes on the throne.  He gave them lands in Jambudīpa.  There those who came from Pubba Videha called their land Videharattha; those from Apara goyāna called it Aparantajanapada, and those from Uttarakuru dwelt in what afterwards came to be known as Kururattha.

His father was king of Pandu and his mother, Mittā, was Vijayabāhu's sister.  He had two brothers, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha.  He married Ratanāvalī, daughter of Vijayabāhu (Cv.lix.42ff).  When Vijayabāhu died, Jayabāhu I.  became king and Mānābharana was made viceroy.  When the rightful heir, Vikkamabāhu, rose in revolt, Mānābharana seized from him Rohana and Dakkhinadesa and lived in Punkhagāma, under the name of Vīrabāhu (Cv.lxi.21ff).  He seems to have lived in constant conflict with Vikkamabāhu.  Later, when he had already two daughters, Mittā and Pabhāvatī, he gave over the government to his ministers and retired from the world.  But seven or eight months later he had a dream in the temple of Indra and hurried back to Punkhagāma because the dream presaged the birth of a mighty son.  This son was Parakkamabāhu I.  Cv.lxii.3ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mānābharana.  &lt;/b&gt; Son of Sirivallabha and Sugalā.  Līlāvatī was his sister (Cv.lxii.2).  He married Mittā, daughter of Mānābharana I., and also her sister, Pabhāvatī, and by the latter he had a son, Kittisirimegha (Cv.lxiv.  19, 23, 24).  Mānābharana reigned in Rohana as an independent king (Cv.lxvii.95).  When the throne was captured by Gajabāhu, Mānābharana tried several times to wrest it from him, but, failing in these attempts, made an alliance with Gajabāhu through the intervention of the monks; later, however, finding Parakkamabāhu growing in power, he went over to him (Cv.lxx.179ff).  When Gajabāhu was captured and detained at Pulatthinagara, the soldiers started to pillage the city, despite the orders of Parakkamabāhu.  The people were enraged and invited Mānābharana to come.  On his arrival at Pulatthipura, he captured Gajabāhu and threw him into a dungeon, seized all the treasures, including the Tooth Relic and Alms bowl, and took counsel with his mother to kill Gajabāhu.  On hearing of this, Parakkamabāhu sent his forces against Mānābharana and defeated the latter's followers at various places.  Mānābharana then fled to Rohana, taking with him some of the treasures (Cv.lxx.255ff).  From there he again tried to ally himself with Gajabāhu; but the latter did not so desire, though his ministers were in favor of it.  Relying on their support, Mānābharana advanced from Rohana.  He was, however, severely defeated at Pūnagāma and other places and Parakkamabāhu's forces assailed him from all sides.  The campaign brought varying success to the opposing armies, and Mānābharana proved a skilful warrior.  He was helped by various chieftains and fought bitterly and valiantly to the end (for details see Cv.lxxii.148 309), but, as he lay dying, he summoned his children and ministers and counseled them to join Parakkamabāhu.  Even after his death his queen Sugalā encouraged intrigues against Parakkamabāhu .  Cv.lxxiv.29ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mānābharana.&lt;/b&gt; A general of Māgha, for whose coronation he was responsible.  Cv.lxxx.73.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mānābharana.&lt;/b&gt; A Damila chief, ally of Kulasekhara.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māpamādakandarā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave, probably not very far from Rājagaha.  When the Buddha went on tour with the monks, some of the latter accompanied him as far as this cave and then turned back.  To such monks the Buddha would say, "Mā pamajjittha" (Be not heedless).  From this fact the cave took its name.  DhA.ii.167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maccharikosiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Maccharikosiya.&lt;/b&gt; A setthi, worth eighty crores, of Sakkhara near Rājagaha.  His real name was Kosiya, but as he was too miserly to give away even a drop of oil, he came to be called Maccharikosiya.  One day, when returning from the palace, he saw a half starved yokel eating a round cake filled with sour gruel.  The sight made him hungry, but fearing to spend his money, he told no one, but lay on his bed in great distress, till his wife found him.  Having discovered the reason for his misery, she said she would bake cakes sufficient for everyone in Sakkhara.  "But that would be such extravagance," said Kosiya, and persuaded his wife to bake just one cake, using only broken grains of rice.  Fearful lest someone should ask for a piece of his cake, he retired with her to the seventh storey of his house and there made her start the cooking after bolting all the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw him with his divine eye and sent Moggallāna to him; Moggallāna stood poised in mid air just outside Kosiya's window and indicated his wish to have something to eat, but Kosiya blustered and threatened, and, after refusing to give him anything, bade his wife cook another little cake for him.  But each cake she baked grew bigger than the previous one, and when she tried to take a single cake from the basket, they all stuck together.  In despair, Kosiya presented cakes and basket to the Elder.  Moggallāna then preached on the importance of generosity, and transported Kosiya, his wife and the cakes to Jetavana.  There the cakes were offered to the Buddha and five hundred monks, and even after they had all eaten, there was no end to the cakes.  The spot where the remaining ones were thrown away at the gates of Jetavana was known as Kapallapūvapabbhāra.  The Buddha preached to Kosiya and his wife and they became sotāpannas.  Kosiya then spent all his wealth in the service of the Buddha and his religion.  It was in reference to him that the Illīsa Jātaka was preached, Illīsa being identified with Maccharikosiya.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;1. Macha Jātaka (No.  34)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fishermen once cast their net into a river, and a great fish, swimming along, toying amorously with his wife, was caught in the net, while his wife escaped.  The fishermen hauled him up and left him on the sand while they proceeded to light a fire and whittle a spit whereon to roast him.  The fish lamented, saying how unhappy his wife would be, thinking he had gone off with another.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's priest, coming along to the river to bathe, heard the lament of the fish and obtained his freedom from the fishermen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a passion tossed monk who longed for the wife of his lay days.  The two fish were the monk and his seducer.  J.i.210-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Maccha Jātaka (No.  75)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as a fish in a pond; there was a great drought, the crops withered, and water gave out in tanks and ponds and there was great distress.  Seeing this, the Bodhisatta approached Pajjuna, god of rain, and made an Act of Truth, begging for rain.  The request succeeded, and heavy rain fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a great drought in Kosala.  Even the pond by the gate of Jetavana was dry, and the Buddha, touched by the universal suffering, resolved to obtain rain.  On his way back from the alms round, he sent Ananda to fetch the robe in which he bathed.  As he was putting this on, Sakka's throne was heated, and he ordered Pajjuna to send rain.  The god filled himself with clouds, and then bending his face and mouth, deluged all Kosala with torrents of rain.  The Pajjuna of the earlier story is identified with Ananda.  J.i.329 32; cp.  Cyp.iii.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Maccha Jātaka &lt;/b&gt; (No.  216)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story very much resembles Maccha Jātaka (1).  J.ii.178f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manikārakulūpaga Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Elder who ate for twelve years at the house of a jeweller of Sāvatthi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day when the jeweller was chopping some meat, Pasenadi sent him a certain precious stone to be cleaned and threaded.  The jeweller took the stone without wiping his hands and put it in a box.  While he went to wash his hands, his pet heron, thinking it was a piece of meat, swallowed it.  Tissa was present and saw this happen.  The jeweller, finding his jewel had disappeared, suspected Tissa and questioned him.  The Elder denied having taken the stone, but said nothing about the heron in case it should be killed.  The jeweller became very angry, and, convinced that Tissa was the thief, proceeded to torture him, in spite of the protests of his wife.  As the blood flowed from the Elder's body, the heron came to drink it, but the jeweller kicked him and he fell down dead.  Then Tissa told the jeweller what had happened.  The heron's crop was cut open and the jewel recovered.  The jeweller was full of remorse and begged Tissa's pardon, which was readily granted, but, soon after, Tissa passed away into Nibbāna.  The heron was reborn in the womb of the jeweller's wife.  She became a deva after death, but the jeweller was reborn in hell.  DhA.iii.34ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manibhaddavattikā&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of ascetics and recluses who, perhaps, worshipped Manibhadda (q.v.).  MNid.89. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahābhārata, Manibhadda is mentioned among the yaksas in Kuvera's palace (ii.10, 397).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the tutelary deity of travellers and caravans (iii.65, 2553).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manibhaddā are mentioned in the Milindapañha (p.191) together with tumblers, jugglers, actors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mallikāvimāna vatthu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Mallikā, wife of Bandhula, who, after death, was born in a wonderful palace in Tāvatimsa, surrounded by all manner of luxuries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was chiefly as a result of her having offered her Mahālatāpasādhana in honour of the Buddha, after his death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna met her in Tāvatimsa and heard her story.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makhādeva-ambavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mango grove in Mithilā where Makhādeva lived in meditation after retiring from household life (J.i.138 f.; vi.  95).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This grove existed even in the time of the Buddha, and during his stay there with Ananda he preached the Makhādeva Sutta (M.ii.74).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.732; see also Mtu.iii.450) that the garden was originally planned by Makhādeva, and that other kings, from time to time, replaced trees which had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māragalla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Rohana, the birthplace of the minister Buddha (Cv.lv.26).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably identical with Mārapabbata mentioned in the account of the campaigns of Mahinda II.  Cv.xlviii.129.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mangala Jātaka (No.  87).  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once an Udicca-brahmin who, having entered the ascetic life, lived in Himavā.  He one day visited Rājagaha, and the king invited him to stay in the Royal Park.  While he was there, a brahmin who believed in omens as shown by clothes (Dussalakkhana brāhmana) found a garment in his chest which had been gnawed by mice, and, fearing disaster, wished to have it thrown out into the charnel ground.  Unwilling to entrust the job to anyone else, he gave the clothes to his son to throw away.  The Bodhisatta saw the garment and picked it up in spite of the grave warnings of the old brahmin, saying that no wise man should believe in omens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a superstitious brahmin of Rājagaha who had his clothes thrown away in the manner related above.  The Buddha was waiting in the charnel field and picked up the garments.  When the brahmin protested, he related to him the story and preached to him on the folly of paying heed to superstitions.  At the end of the sermon, father and son became sotāpannas.  The characters in both stories are the same.  J.i.371ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manicūla Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the royal palace at Rājagaha, the report once arose among the retinue that Sākyan recluses were allowed to take gold and silver.  The headman Manicūlaka, who was present, denied this, but, being unable to convince his audience, he sought the Buddha, who assured him that these monks were allowed neither to seek nor to accept gold and silver.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mānavamma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Mānavamma.  See Māna, Nos.  2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Mānavamma.  Elder brother of Māna (Māna 2) and son of Kassapa II.  Once, as he made an incantation, the god Kumāra appeared before him, riding his peacock; the bird, finding nothing to drink, flew at Mānavamma's face.  He, thereupon, offered the peacock his eye, of which the bird drank.  Kumāra promised him the fulfilment of his wish, but he did not aspire to royal power, and retired in favour of his younger brother Māna.  Cv.lvii.5ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Once in the past he was a hermit living on the banks of the Sindhu, and, having seen Sumedha Buddha, he gave him some honey.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that on the day of his birth there was a shower of honey (Ap.i.325).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Mahānāma Thera.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manāpakāyikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of devas possessing lovely forms.  Once a large number of them visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; at the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama,Ghositirāma')"&gt;Ghositirāma&lt;/a&gt; and announced to him that in a trice they could assume any colour they desired, produce any sound, and obtain any happiness.  Anuruddha tested their claims and found them to be true.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of them sang, some danced, some clapped, some played on various musical instruments, but finding that their entertainment was lost on Anuruddha, they left him.  Anuruddha told the Buddha of their visit, and the Buddha explained to him the eight qualities, the possession of which enabled women to be born among the Manāpakāyikā.  A.iv.265ff., also ibid., 268, where the Buddha speaks of them to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt;; cf.

Tissā) and offered him the flowers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy three kappas ago he was a king, named Jotiya.  Ap.i.228.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mangalacetiya&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A religious building, probably in Anurādhapura.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upatissa II.  erected a thūpa to the north of it and also an image house containing an image (Cv.xxxvii.183).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably identical with Bahumangalacetiya (q.v.).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makkata Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In certain tracts of the Himālaya where monkeys resort, hunters set up traps of pitch to catch the monkeys.  Wise monkeys avoid the traps, but the foolish ones handle the pitch and their paws stick in it, one after another, and finally their muzzles, in their struggles to escape.  So it is with foolish men who allow their senses to roam in wrong pastures - the objects of the senses.  S.v.148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mallā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a people and their country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is included in the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"&gt;Mahājanapadas&lt;/a&gt; of the Buddha's time.  The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusinārā')"&gt;Kusinārā&lt;/a&gt;.  The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyaka Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā.  That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha's death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha's relics (D.ii.165).  Each had their Mote Hall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sangīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda,Cunda')"&gt;Cunda&lt;/a&gt; the smith.  A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby.  The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night.  It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda (D.ii.126f).  From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death.  The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects.  Ananda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family.  After the Buddha's death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;.  They cremated the Buddha's body at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makutabandhana,Makutabandhana')"&gt;Makutabandhana&lt;/a&gt; cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Dona (D.ii.166).  The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour (D.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Malla capital of Kujsinārā was, in the Buddha's day, a place of small importance.  Ananda contemptuously refers to it as a "little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township," quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha's Parinibbāna.  But the Buddha informs Ananda that it was once Kusāvatī (q.v.), the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana.  This shows that the Mallas had, at first, a monarchical constitution, but in the sixth century B.C.  they were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic (sangha, gana) (M.i.231).  The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.  Those who were free from such duties engaged in trade, sometimes undertaking long caravan journeys (DA.ii.569).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Buddha and Nigantha Nātaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas.  Pāvā was the scene of Nātaputta's death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha's (see Pāvā).  Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khandasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Roja and Sīha (q.v.).  The Mallas seem to have lived at peace with their neighbours, though there was apparently some trouble between them and the Licchavis, as shown by the story of Bandhula Malla (q.v.).  Both the Mallas and the Licchavis were khattiyas, belonging to the Vasittha gotta, because in the books both tribes are repeatedly referred to as Vāsetthā (q.v.).  Manu says that both Licchavis and Mallas had ksatriya parents, but their fathers were Vrātyas - i.e., had not gone through the ceremony of Vedic initiation at the proper time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is reason to believe that the Malla republic fell into the hands of Ajātasattu, as did that of the Licchavis (Bhandarkar, Carmichael Lectures, 1918, p.79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mallas are generally identified with the Malloi mentioned in the Greek accounts of Alexander's invasion of India.  The Malloi were a warlike tribe who, for some time, successfully resisted Alexander's attack.  Their territory must have been situated in or near the Panjab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed - e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiyā and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula went from Kusināra to Takkasilā for purposes of study.  v.l.  Mālā (E.g., UdA.377) and Malatā (E.g., AA.ii.814), evidently both wrong readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mallā.&lt;/b&gt; A bhikkhunī who came to Ceylon from Jambudīpa; she was an eminent teacher of the Vinaya at Anurādhapura.  Dpv.xviii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahimsaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kingdom mentioned in the Sankhapāla Jātaka as being near Mount Candaka.  There lived the Bodhisatta, in a hermitage on the bend of the river Kannapannā, where it left Lake Sankhapāla (J.v.162).  Keka is mentioned as the capital of Mahimsaka, where a king named Ajjuna once ruled (J.v.145) also a city, called Sakula, capital of King Sakula.  Near Sakula was a lake, called Mānusiya (J.v.337).  In the Bhīmasena Jātaka (J.i.356) the Bodhisatta is mentioned as living for some time in Mahimsaka in his birth as Cūladhanuggaha pandita.  Mahimsaka is mentioned (E.g., Vibhā.4) as an example of a country where cold weather frequently occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country is generally identified with Malayagiri, the Malabar Ghats.  See also Mahisamandala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māyādhanu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Māyādhanu.  The youngest brother of Bhuvanekabāhu VII.  and father of Rājasīha I.  He reigned over a part of Ceylon with his capital at Sītāvaka (1521 81 A.C.).  His reign was marked by a series of severe and fluctuating struggles against his brother and against the Portuguese then in Colombo.  He is said to have been succeeded by his son, Rājasīha.

It was called a cetiya because it was decorated (cittakatthena pan'esa cetiyam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DA.ii.596; see also Dvy.  201. Hiouen Thsang's description (Beal, op.  cit., ii.37) of the stūpa erected at what is evidently Makutabandhana suggests a different explanation.  It was there that the Mallas laid aside their diamond maces (? makuta) and fell prostrate on the ground with grief at the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manāpadāyi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugga, a householder of Vesāli, having heard from the Buddha that the giver of good things (manāpadāyī) gains the good, invites the Buddha to his house and gives him various things which he himself is very fond of gruel from sal flowers, flesh of pigs with jujube-fruit, oily tube like vegetables, rice with curries and condiments, muslin from Benares and a sandalwood plank (in place of a luxurious couch, which, Ugga knew, the Buddha could not accept).  Out of compassion for Ugga, the Buddha accepted these gifts and blessed him.  Later, Ugga died and was reborn in a mind born world (manomayakāya).  He visited the Buddha at Jetavana and told him that his hopes had been realized.  A.iii.49f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a devaputta in Himavā, and, coming across some monks who had lost their way in the forest, he entertained them and set them on the right road.  One hundred and five kappas ago he was king twelve times under the name of Sacakkhu (Ap.i.152f).  He is probably identical with Ekadhammasavaniya.  ThagA.i.151f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Macchuddāna Jātaka (No.  288)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once the son of a landed proprietor, and, after his father's death, he and his younger brother went to a village to settle some business.  On their way back, they had a meal out of a leaf bottle, and, when they had finished, the Bodhisatta threw the remains into the river for the fish, giving the merit to the river spirit.  The power of the river spirit increased and she discovered the cause.  The younger brother was of a dishonest disposition, and when the elder was asleep, he packed a parcel of gravel to resemble the money they were carrying and put them both away.  While they were in mid river he stumbled against the side of the boat and dropped overboard what he thought to be the parcel of gravel, but what was really the money.  He told the Bodhisatta about it who said, "Never mind, what's gone has gone." But the river spirit out of gratitude to the Bodhisatta made a fish swallow the parcel.  The fish was later caught and hawked about, and, owing again to the influence of the spirit, the fisherman asked one thousand pieces and seven annas for it, and the people laughed at what they thought was a joke.  But when they came to the Bodhisatta's house, they offered him the fish for seven annas.  The fish was bought and cut open by his wife, and the money was given to him.  At that instant the river spirit informed him of what she had done and asked him to have no consideration for his brother, who was a thief and was greatly disappointed at the failure of his trick.  But the Bodhisatta sent him five hundred pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a dishonest merchant who is identified with the cheat.  J.ii.423-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makkhali Gosāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six heretical teachers contemporaneous with the Buddha.  He held (*1) that there is no cause, either ultimate or remote, for the depravity of beings or for their rectitude.  The attainment of any given condition or character does not depend either on one's own acts, nor on the acts of another, nor on human effort.  There is no such thing as power or energy or human strength or human vigour.  All beings (sattā), all lives (pānā), all existent things (bhūtā), all living substances (jīvā), (*2) are bent this way and that by their fate, by the necessary conditions of the class to which they belong, by their individual nature; it is according to their position in one or other of the six classes (abhijāti) that they experience ease or pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are fourteen hundred thousands of principle genera or species (pamukhayoniyo), again six thousand others and again six hundred.  There are five hundred kinds of kamma - there are sixty two paths (or modes of conduct), sixty two periods, six classes among men, eight stages of a prophet's existence (atthapurisabhūmi), (*3) forty nine hundred kinds of occupation, forty nine hundred Ājīvakas, forty nine hundred Wanderers (Paribbājaka), forty nine hundred Nāga abodes (or species), two thousand sentient existences (vīse indriyasate), three thousand infernal states, thirty six celestial, mundane or passionate grades (rajodhātuyo), seven classes of animate beings (saññigabbhā), or beings with the capacity of generating by means of separate sexes, seven of inanimate production (asaññigabbhā), seven of production by grafting (niganthagabbhā), seven grades of gods, men, devils, great lakes, precipices, dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*1) D.i.53 f.  Makkhali, his views and his followers are also referred to at M.i.231, 238, 483, 516f.; S.i.66, 68; iii.211; iv.398; A.i.33f., 286; iii.276, 384; also J.i.493, 509; S.iii.69 ascribes the first portion of the account of Makkhali's views (as given in D.i.53) that there is no cause, no reason for depravity or purity to Pūrana Kassapa.  A.i.286 apparently confounds Makkhali with Ajita Kesakambala, and A.iii.383f.  represents Pūrana Kassapa as though he were a disciple of Makkhali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*2) Buddhaghosa (DA.i.160 ff.) gives details of these four classes showing how they are meant to include all that has life on this earth, from men down to plants.  But the explanation is very confused and makes the terms by no means mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*3) Buddhaghosa gives them as babyhood, playtime, trial time, erect time, learning time, ascetic time, prophet time, and prostrate time, with (very necessary) comments on each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are eighty four thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain.  This cannot be done by virtue, or penance, or righteousness.  Ease and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration (samsāra); there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, exactly for the allotted term, shall then, and then only, make an end of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makkhali's views as given in the Buddhist books are difficult to understand, the Commentators themselves finding it a hopeless task.  He seems to have believed in infinite gradations of existence; in his view, each individual thing has eternal existence, if not individually, at least in type.  He evidently had definite conceptions of numerous grades of beings, celestial, infernal and mundane, as also of the infinity of time and the recurrent cycles of existence.  He seems to have conceived the world as a system in which everything has a place and a function assigned to it, a system in which chance has no place and which admits of no other cause whatever, of the depravity or purity of beings, but that which is implied in the word Fate or Destiny (niyati).  All types of things and all species of beings, however, are individually capable of transformation that is of elevation or degradation in type.  His theory of purification through transmigration (samsārasuddhi) probably meant perfection through transformation (parinatā) - transformation which implies not only the process of constant change, but also a fixed orderly mode of progression and retrogression.  All things must, in course of time, attain perfection (for a discussion on Makkhali and his doctrines see Barua: Pre buddhistic Indian Philosophy, 297ff).  Makkhali's followers are known as the Ājīvakas (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the books, the Buddha considered Makkhali as the most dangerous of the heretical teachers: "I know not of any other single person fraught with such loss to many folk, such discomfort, such sorrow to devas and men, as Makkhali, the infatuate (A.i.33).  The Buddha also considered his view the meanest - just as the hair blanket is reckoned the meanest of all woven garments, even so, of all the teachings of recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest (A.i.286).  Buddhaghosa (DA.i.166f) draws particular distinction between the moral effect of Makkhali's doctrine on the one hand and that of the doctrines of Pūrana Kassapa and Ajita on the other.  Pūrana, by his theory of the passivity of the soul, denied action; Ajita, by his annihilationistic theory denied retribution; whereas Makkhali, by his doctrine of fate or non causation, denied both action and its result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very little is known of the name and the life of Makkhali.  The Buddhist records call him Makkhali Gosāla.  Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.143f; MA.i.422) that he was once employed as a servant; one day, while carrying an oil-pot along a muddy road, he slipped and fell through carelessness, although warned thus by his master: "Mā khali," (stumble not) - hence his name.  When he found that the oil pot was broken, he fled; his master chased him and caught him by his garment, but he left it and ran along naked.  He was; called Gosāla, because he was born in a cow shed.  According to Jaina records (e.g.  Uvāsaga-dasāo, p.1), he is called Gosāla Mankhaliputta; he was born at Saravana near Sāvatthi, his father's name being Mankhali and his mother's Bhaddā.  His father was a Mankha i.e., a dealer in pictures- and Gosāla followed this profession until he became a monk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The philosopher's true name (Barua, op.  cit., 298) seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Pāli form Makkhali.  "Maskarin" is explained by Pāninī (VI.i.154) as "one who carries a bamboo staff" (maskara).  A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin.  According to Patañjali (Mahābhāsya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they denied the freedom of the will.  The Maskarins were thus fatalists or determinists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

It was the residence of the Elder Mahā Tissa, reciter of the Dhammapada.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, recited there, in the assembly of the monks, the story of her past lives (DhA.iv.51).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.448; also DhSA.30; AA.i.52) the monastery was in the village of Kālakagāma, and, in the time of Vattagāmanī, it was the residence of many monks, at the head of whom was Tissabhūta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also the residence of Maliyadeva Thera.

Māgandiya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The conversation between Māgandiya and the Buddha after the former had offered the Buddha his daughter in marriage.  Māgandiya expresses the view that purity comes from philosophy, from disputations and discussions, learning and.  austerities.  The Buddha denies this, and says that purity comes from inward peace.  The sage (muni) is a confessor of peace and does not indulge in disputes.  SN.  vs.  835 47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Māgandiya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Records the conversation between the Buddha and the paribbājaka Māgandiya.  Māgandiya says the Buddha is a repressionist (bhunahu) and this the Buddha denies, saying that he teaches only the subjugation of the senses, knowing their origin and their cessation; he has discarded all craving after them and dwells with his heart at peace.  He then relates how, in his youth, he had enjoyed the greatest and most luxurious kinds of sensuous pleasures and had renounced them.  He could no more crave for them than a leper, cured of his disease, craves for his old sores.  Both the Buddha and teachers of other persuasions are convinced that health is the greatest boon and Nibbāna the highest bliss.  But the Buddha's conception of health and Nibbāna differs from that of other teachers.  Their knowledge is as that of a blind man, taken on trust.  Māgandiya listens and is convinced.  He enters the Order and becomes an arahant.  M.i.501 13; Thomas: op.  cit., 115.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhurapācikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman of Sāvatthi, wife of a man who joined the Order in his old age with his friends.  All these friends used to eat at his house, where they were well looked after.  But the wife died, and they all lamented greatly.  The Buddha heard of this, and sent for them and recited to them the Kāka Jātaka (q.v.) (J.i.497ff).  At the end of the discourse the aged monks all became sotāpannas.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a country and its people (Maddā).  In the Kusa Jātaka (q.v.), Kusa, son of Okkāka, king of Kusāvatī in the Malla country, is mentioned as having married Pabhāvatī, daughter of the king of Madda, and the capital of the Madda king was Sāgala (J.v.283ff.; Kusāvati was one hundred leagues from Sāgala (J.v.290), cp.  Mtu.ii.441f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the similar story of Anitthigandha, a prince of Benares contracts a marriage with a daughter of the king of Sāgala his name being Maddava; but the girl dies on the way to her husband.  (SNA.i.68f.; cp.  DhA.iii.281, about the other Anitthigandha of Sāvatthi of the Buddha's days, who also married a Madda princess).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chaddanta Jātaka also mentions a matrimonial alliance between the royal houses of Benares and Sāgala, while in the Kālingabodhi Jātaka (J.iv.230f ) the Madda king's daughter marries a prince of Kālinga while both are in exile.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.v.39f.; so also in the Mūgapakkha Jātaka (J.vi.1), the wife of the Kāsi king was the daughter of the king of Madda, Candadevi by name; while Phusatī, wife of Sañjaya of Jetuttara in the Sivi kingdom and mother of Vessantara, was also a Madda princess (J.vi.480); likewise Maddī, wife of Vessantara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cūlani, son of Talatā, also married a princess of Madda (J.vi.471).  According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.viii.7; this probably refers to Madras and not to the Madda country, whose capital was Sāgala), Sumitta, son of Sīhabāhu and king of Sīhapura, married the daughter of the Madda king and had three sons by him, the youngest of whom, Panduvāsudeva, became king of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddā Kāpilānī wife of Pippalimānava (Mahā Kassapa), was the daughter of a Kosiyagotta brahmin of Sāgala in the Madda country.  Men went there in search of a wife for him because it was famed for the beauty of its women (Maddarattham nāma itthāgāro) (ThagA.ii.142; ThigA.68).  Anojā, wife ofMahā Kappina of Kukkutavatī, also came from the royal household of Madda (DhA.ii.116), as did Khemā, wife of Bimbisāra (ThigA.127).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wife of a Cakkavattī comes either from Uttarakuru or from the royal family of Madda (MA.ii.950; DA.ii.626; KhA.173).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the identification of Madda see Sāgala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Makkata Jātaka (No.  173)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was a learned brahmin of Kāsi, and, when his wife died, he retired with his son to the Himālaya, where they lived the ascetic life.  One day during a heavy shower of rain, a monkey, wishing to gain admission to the ascetics' hut, put on the bark dress of a dead ascetic and stood outside the door.  The son wished to admit him, but the Bodhisatta recognised the monkey and drove him a way.  The boy is identified with Rāhula (J.ii.68 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circumstances in which the story was related are given in the Uddāla Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mattā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mattā.  &lt;/b&gt; A Therī who came to Ceylon from Jambudīpa and taught the Vinaya at Anurādhapura.  Dpv.xviii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mattā.  &lt;/b&gt; A petī.  In her previous life she was married to a householder of Sāvatthi, but, because she was barren, her husband married another woman, named Tissā, by whom he had a child called Bhūta.  One day, when Tissā and her husband were talking together, Mattā was seized with jealousy and threw a heap of dirt on Tissā's head.  After death, Mattā was born as a petī and suffered grievously.  She appeared before Tissā, and, at her request, Tissā, gave alms to eight monks, giving the merit to Mattā.  Mattā immediately won heavenly bliss.  Pv.ii.3; PvA.82ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātuvihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mātuvihāra.&lt;/b&gt; A vihāra built by King Saddhātissa.  Mhv.xxxiii.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mātuvihāra&lt;/b&gt;.  A vihāra built by the mother of Gajabāhukagāmanī, on the spot where, in a thicket of flowering kadambas, she had met an ascetic rising from a trance of seven days and had given him food which she was taking to her father the brick worker.  As a result of this gift she became the queen of Vankanāsikatissa.  Later she bought the piece of land for one thousand and built there the vihāra.  Gajabāhukagāmanī built a stone thūpa connected with it and gave lands to the monks of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.104ff., 115ff).  The full name of this vihāra seems to have been Rājamātuvihāra (q.v.).  MT.  656.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masakkasāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name given to Tāvatimsa, the abode of Vāsava (Sakka) (J.v.167; vi.  272, 289, 400; VvA.350).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast explains (J.v.168; vi.  272) that Masakkasāra is really the name of Mount Sineru, so called because it is immoveable (Masakkasāro vuccati osakkana parisakkanābhāvena ghanasāratāya ca Sinerupabbarājā), and Tāvatimsa came to be known as Masakkasāra because it was built on Sineru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahimsāsaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An heretical sect, which broke off from the Theravādins at the same time as the Vajjiputtakas.  The sect was later divided into the Sabbatthivādins and the Dhammaguttikas (Mhv.v.  6, 8; Dpv.v.45, 47; MT.  174f.; Mhv.  96).  They held that the truth of nirodha had two aspects (Kvu.ii.11; see also viii.9; xviii.6; xix.8; xx.5; and Rockhill, op.  cit., 182-186, 191-192).  Buddhadeva Thera, at whose request the Jātakatthakathā was written, belonged to the Mahimsāsaka Vamsa (J.i.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fa Hsien found a group of monks belonging to this sect in Ceylon.  (Giles, op.  cit., p.  76.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mamsa Jātaka (No.  315)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four sons of four rich merchants of Benares were once sitting at the cross roads, and, seeing a deer stalker hawking venison in a cart, one of them proposed to get some flesh from him.  So he went up to the man and said, " Hi! My man! Give me some meat," and the hunter gave him some skin and bone; the second, going up to him addressed him as "Elder Brother" and was given a joint; but the third cajoled him, calling him "Father," and received a savoury piece of meat; while the fourth (the Bodhisatta) addressed him as "Friend," and was given the whole of the rest of the deer, and the meat was conveyed to his house in the man's cart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Sāriputta.  Some monks of Jetavana, having taken oil as a purgative, wished for some dainty food.  They sent their attendants to beg in the cooks' quarters, but these had to come back empty handed.  Sāriputta met them, and, having heard their story, returned with them to the same street; the people gave him a full measure of dainty fare, which was distributed among the sick monks.  Sāriputta is identified with the hunter of the story.  J.iii.48-51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manipāsāda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the Lohapāsāda, after it had been rebuilt in seven storeys by Jetthatissa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He offered to the building a jewel worth sixty thousand, hence its name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building was worth one crore (Mhv.xxxvi.125).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colas burnt it down, and Udaya IV.  tried to rebuild it, but died before the work was completed (Cv.liii.51).  This was done by Mahinda IV.  Cv.liv.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mandāravapūjaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a devaputta, and offered the Buddha some mandārava flowers, which remained like a canopy over the Buddha's head for seven days.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten kappas ago he was a king named Jutindhara (Ap.i.178).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Usabha Thera.  ThagA.i.219.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahelanagara&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Damila stronghold, subdued by Dutthagāmani after a four months' siege.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its commander was called Mahela (Mhv.xxv.48f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (479f.) explains that the city lay off the road leading from Vijitapura to Anurādhapura.  It was the king's elephant, Kandula, who led the way thither.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;The city erected on the spot where the elephant turned off the main road was called Nivattagirinagara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maggadāyaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety four kappas ago he saw Siddhattha Buddha walking in the forest, and, with basket and hoe, made a path for him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty seven kappas ago he was a king named Suppabuddha (Ap.i.173).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Eraka Thera.  ThagA.i.193f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māthara &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(v.l.  Matthara).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parrot belonging to Mahosadha.  When Mahosadha wished to find out the plans of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, he sent Māthara to the mynah that lived in Cūlanī's bedchamber.  Māthara made love to her, pretending that he had come from Aritthapura to ask her to marry him, because his first wife (also a mynah) had been killed by a hawk.  He related the stories of Vāsudeva and Jambāvatī and of Vaccha and Rattavatī, to prove that husband and wife need not be equal in birth.  Having won her heart and discovered Cūlanī's secrets, Māthara flew back to Mahosadha (J.vi.418ff).  He is identified with Ananda.  J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātangaputta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Mātanga, a landowner of Kosala.  He was idle, and, when rebuked, joined the monks, hoping thus to have an easy life.  But one day he heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a mighty Nāga king, and, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, he honoured him by giving him his throat jewel (Thag.vss.231 3; ThagA.i.348ff).  He is probably identical with Manipūjaka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.413f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marutta-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;pokkharanī&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tank in Anurādhapura, north of the royal palace, in the time of Devānampiyatissa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mahinda scattered flowers on it the earth trembled, and Mahinda prophesied that it would become the Jantāghara-pokkhoranī situated to the east of the gateway of the Kālapāsāna-parivena.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had disappeared by the time the Mahāvamsa Tīkā was written (MT.344f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sīmā of the Mahāvihāra passed through the tank.  Mbv.135, 136.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhupindika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dandapāni meets the Buddha at the Mahāvana near Kapilavatthu and questions him as to his tenets.  The Buddha explains that his tenets are such that they avoid all strife and make a man dwell above all pleasures of sense, etc.  Dandapāni shakes his head and walks on, without comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the evening the Buddha visits the Nigrodhārāma and tells the monks there briefly how to get rid of all obsessions, so that all evil and wrong states of mind are quelled and pass away entirely.  After the Buddha's departure the monks seek Mahā Kaccāna and ask him to expound in detail what the Buddha has told them in brief.  Kaccāna explains that where there is eye and visible form, visual consciousness arises, this begets contact, contact conditions feeling, what a man feels he perceives, what he perceives he reasons about, and this leads to obsession.  It is the same with the other senses.  The monks report this explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it and praises Kaccāna's earning and insight.  Ananda praises the discourse, comparing it to a honeyed pill of delicious savour, and the Buddha suggests that the sutta should be remembered by that name (Madhupindika) (M.i.108-14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nāgita was; among those present when the sutta was preached.  He was thereby persuaded to enter the Order, and soon after became an arahant.  ThagA.i.183.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mātuposaka Jātaka (No.  455)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as an elephant in the Himālaya and looked after his blind mother, who lived near Mount Candorana.  One day he met a forester who had lost his way, and, feeling sorry for him, the elephant set him on the right path, carrying him on his back.  But the forester was wicked, and, on his return to Benares, told the king about the elephant.  The king asked him to fetch the elephant, who, seeing the forester approaching, meekly followed him lest his virtue be impaired.  The elephant was received in the city with great pomp and placed in the royal stables as the state elephant, but he would touch no morsel of food.  The king enquired into this and learnt of the elephant's blind mother.  Thereupon the elephant was set free, and returned to the Himālaya amid the applause of the people.  The king built a town near the elephant's dwelling, where he showed him great honour, and later, when, at his mother's death, the elephant went away to the Karandaka monastery to wait on the ascetics there, the king did the same for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who tended his mother.  For details see the Sāma Jātaka.  Ananda is identified with the king, whose name is given as Vedeha, and Mahāmāyā with the mother-elephant (J.iv.90 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.13) calls this the Mātuposaka Nāgarāja&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;Jātaka and gives the name of the elephant as Dhanapāla.  It was related to the four sons of a brahmin who waited on their aged father.  The audience shed floods of tears, so greatly were they moved, and the brahmin and his sons became sotāpannas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mañjūsaka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tree in Gandhamādana in front of the Maniguhā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one yojana in height and one in girth, and bears all the flowers, which bloom both on land and in water, on earth and in heaven.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the tree is the Sabbaratanamāla, where the Pacceka Buddhas hold their assembly.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place of meeting seems also to have been called the Mañjūsakamāla.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Majjhavela vihāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon built by Vattagāmanī and restored by Kittisirirājasīha, who gave for its maintenance the village of Singatthala.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mandhātu Jātaka (No.  258)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of King Mandhātā.  It was told to a backsliding monk who, while travelling in Sāvatthi for alms, saw an attractively dressed woman and fell in love with her.  This was reported to the Buddha, who told him this story to show that lust could never be satisfied.  At the end of the discourse the monk, with many others, became a sotāpanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.iii.240 gives a different occasion for the story; but that, too, refers to a discontented monk.  J.ii.310ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māluta&lt;b&gt;Jātaka&lt;/b&gt; (No.  17)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, two friends, a lion and a tiger, lived in a cave.  They had a dispute as to which was the cold part of the month, the dark half or the light, and they referred the matter to a hermit (the Bodhisatta), who said that the cold was caused by wind and not by light or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to two forest dwelling monks of Kosala, Kāla and Junha, who consulted the Buddha in a similar dispute.  The lion and the tiger are identified with the monks.  J.i.164ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mañjerika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the Nāga kingdom (Nāgabhavana).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is five hundred leagues in extent and is the residence of Mahākāla, the Nāga king (J.i.72; J.vi.264; BuA.239).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the urn containing the Buddha's relics, deposited in Rāmagāma, was washed away, it was taken to the Mañjerika Nāgabhavana, and remained there till taken by Sonuttara to be enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mangana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality, probably a monastery in Ceylon, the residence of an arahant, Khuddaka Tissa (Kujjaka Tissa) (Mhv.xxxii.53; J.vi.30).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place was five leagues from Anurādhapura and was visited by Saddhātissa (AA.i.384).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mangana vihāra is mentioned among the religious buildings erected by Dhātusena (Cv.xxxviii.48).  This was probably a restoration of the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Mahī.&lt;/b&gt; One of the five great rivers of India, all of which have a common origin (Vin.ii.237; A.iv.101; v.  22; S.ii.135; v.  38; Mil.  20, 104; Vsm.10, etc.).  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anguttaraapa,Anguttarāpa')"&gt;Anguttarāpa&lt;/a&gt; was to the north of the Mahī (SNA.ii.437ff).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maddī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Vessantara whose first cousin she was, being the daughter of the Madda king.  When Vessantara went into exile, she, with her two children, Jāli and Kanhājinā, accompanied him.  At Vankagiri she and the children occupied one of the hermitages provided for them by Vissakamma, at Sakka's orders.  While she was getting fruit and leaves, Jūjaka obtained from Vessantara the two children as slaves.  Maddī the previous night had had a dream warning her of this, but Vessantara had consoled her.  When she came back from her quest for food later than usual, the gods having contrived to detain her, she found the children missing, and searched for them throughout the night.  It was at dawn the next day, on her recovery from a death like swoon, that Vessantara told her of the gift of the children, describing the miracles, which had attended the gift and showing how they presaged that he would reach Enlightenment.  Maddī, understanding, rejoiced herself in the gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day Sakka appeared in the guise of a brahmin and asked Vessantara, to give him Maddī as his slave.  Seeing him hesitate, Maddī urged him to let her go, saying that she belonged to him to do as he would with her.  The gift was made and accepted by Sakka.  He then, however, gave her back, with praises of Vessantara and Maddī.  For these details see the Vessantara Jātaka; we also Cyp.i.9; Mil.117, 281 f; J.i.77; DhA.i.406.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddī is identified with Rāhulamātā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manicora Jātaka (No.  194)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a householder in a village near Benares and he had a most beautiful wife, named Sujātā.  One day, at her request, they prepared some sweetmeats, and, placing them in a cart, started for Benares to see her patents.  On the way Sujātā was seen by the king of Benares, and, wishing to possess her, he ordered the jewel of his diadem to be introduced into the Bodhisatta's cart.  The cry of " thief " was then set up, and the Bodhisatta arrested and taken off to be executed.  But Sakkas throne was heated by Sujātā's lamentations, and, descending to earth, Sakka made the king and the Bodhisatta change places.  The king was beheaded, and Sakka, revealing himself, set the Bodhisatta on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devatattas attempts to kill the Buddha.  The king is identified with Devadatta, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Rāhulamātā with Sujātā (J.ii.121 5).  The story gives the case of a man getting happiness through a virtuous woman.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magadhakhetta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made in the books of the Magadhakhetta, probably an extensive rice field which at once caught the eye on account of its terraces.  It could be seen from the Indasāla guhā (ThagA.i.333).  The contour of the field struck the Buddha's imagination and he asked Ananda to design a robe of the same pattern.  Ananda did this very successfully, and this pattern has been adopted for the robes of members of the Order ever since (Vin.i.287).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suvannnakakkata Jātaka (J.iii.293; also iv.277) mentions a field of one thousand karīsas (about eight thousand acres) in a brahmin village called SāIindiya to the east of Rājagaha.  Magadhakhetta may sometimes have been used as another name for Magadha.  See, e.g., AA.i.126, where NāIakagāma is mentioned as having been in Magadhakhetta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Majjhapalli vihāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vihāra in Ceylon restored by the monk Sangharakkhita in the reign of Kittisirirājasīha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king showed the monk great honour and gave the village of Mālāgāma for the maintenance of the vihāra.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māyā Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, Vepacitti, ruler of the Asuras, was ill.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was visited by Sakka, who was requested by the Asuras to heal him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka agreed to do this if Vepacitti would teach him the Sambaramāyā.  But Vepacitti wished to consult the Asuras on this matter and was advised against it.  S.i.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahiyangana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in the old Mahānāga garden, on the banks of the Mahāvālukagangā.  It was there that the Buddha hovered in the air on his first visit to Ceylon, in order to frighten the Yakkhas.  Later, Mahāsumana built there a shrine seven cubits in diameter, all of sapphire, and containing the hair given to him by the Buddha.  After the Buddha's death, Sarabhū, a disciple of Sāriputta, brought there the collar bone of the Buddha, which he deposited in the thūpa, increasing the height of the thūpa to twelve cubits.  Uddhacūlābhaya raised it to thirty cubits, while Dutthagāmanī, dwelling there during his campaign against the Damila Chatta, increased it to eighty cubits (Mhv.i.24, 33ff.; xxv.7; Cv.  Trs.i.154, n.3).  Vohārika Tissa erected a parasol over the thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.34).  Attached to the thūpa was a vihāra, near which lived the three Lambakannas, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times, Sena II.  gave maintenance villages to the vihāra (Cv.li.74), as did also Kassapa IV.  (Cv.lii.14).  Vijayabāhu I.  found the vihāra in a bad state of decay and had it restored, (Cv.lx.59) while Parakkamabāhu VI.  carried out repairs to the thūpa (Cv.xci.29).  King Vīravikamma went from his capital to Mahiyangana, a distance of seven gāvutas on foot, and held a great festival in honour of the thūpa (Cv.xcii.17).  King Narindasīha is mentioned as having visited Mahiyangana three times once alone and twice with his army and as having held magnificent festivals in its honour (Cv.xcvii.27ff).  Vijayarājasīha held a festival there (Cv.xcviii.85), as did Kittisirirājasīha, who made a pilgrimage to the spot (Cv.xcix.38); he also made arrangements for travelers from Siam to Ceylon to visit the spot and hold celebrations there (Cv.c.125ff).  Rājasīha II.  was born in Mahiyangana, while his parents were staying there for protection from their enemies.  Cv.xcv.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Near by was a village of merchants where Punna went for his alms and where lived his brother Culla Punna.  After the merchants had been saved from death by the intervention of Punna, they gave him a share of the red sandalwood they had obtained in the course of their travels, and with this they built a mandalamāla in the vihāra and dedicated it to the Buddha.  The Buddha lived there for seven days.  SA.iii.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mayhaka Jātaka (No.  390)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in a very wealthy family, and he built an alms hall and gave away generously.  He married, and, on the birth of a son, he entrusted wife and child to his younger brother and became an ascetic.  When the boy began to grow up, the brother drowned him in the river lest he should claim half the estate.  The Bodhisatta saw this with his divine eye and called on his brother, to whom he pointed out the folly of covetousness - “You are like the bird, Mayhaka, who sits on the pipal tree and keeps on crying 'Mine, mine,' while the other birds eat the fruit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a wealthy man of Sāvatthi, a stranger who settled down there.  He neither enjoyed his wealth nor gave it to others, living in poverty, eating rice dust and sour gruel, and travelling in a broken down chariot with a parasol of leaves.  He died without issue and his money, passed to the king.  When the king told the Buddha of this, the Buddha explained to him that the miser had, in a previous birth, met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhī begging for alms and had sent word to his wife to give the food prepared for himself.  This the wife gladly did.  But the man saw Tagarasikhī with his bowl full of sweet foods and repented of his generosity.  Therefore, in this birth, though possessing much wealth, he never enjoyed it.  He was childless because he was the very man who had drowned the Bodhisatta's son.

Like a fish trap set at a river mouth is Makkhali, existing for the distress and destruction of many beings.  He who urges adherence to a doctrine and discipline rightly expounded, he whom he thus urges, and he who, thus urged, walks therein accordingly, all alike beget much merit.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Macchā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country, with its people, included in the traditional List of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (A.i.213; iv.  252, 256, 260).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macchā are generally mentioned with the Sūrasenā (E.g., D.ii.200; cp.  Kāsikosalā, Vajjimallā).  In the Vidhura Pandita Jātaka (J.  i.280) the Macchā are mentioned among those who witnessed the game of dice between the king of the Kurus and Punnaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macchā country lay to the south or south west of Indraprastha and to the south of Sūrasena.  Its capital was Virātanagara or Vairāt, so called because it was the city of King Virāta.  Rv.vii.6, 18; Law: Anct.  Geog.  Of India, p.  19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mangala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; in answer to a question asked by a deva as to which are the auspicious things (mangalāni) in the world.  The sutta describes thirty seven mangalāni, including such things as the avoidance of fools, association with the wise, honouring those worthy of honour, etc.  (Khp.pp.2f) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (KhpA.vii.; SNA.i.300) explains that at the time the sutta was preached there was great discussion over the whole of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt; regarding the constitution of mangala.  The devas heard the discussion and argued among themselves till the matter spread to the highest Brahma world.  Then it was that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; suggested that a devaputta should visit the Buddha and ask him about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata,Sutta Nipāta')"&gt;Sutta Nipāta&lt;/a&gt; (SN., pp.  46f) the sutta is called Mahāmangala.  It is one of the suttas at the preaching of which countless devas were present and countless beings realized the Truth (SNA.i.174; BuA.243; AA.i.57,320).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is often recited, and forms one of the commonest of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paritta,Parittas')"&gt;Parittas&lt;/a&gt;.  To have it written down in a book is considered an act of great merit (MA.ii.806).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mhv.xxxii.43) that once&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dutthagaamanii,Dutthagāmani')"&gt;Dutthagāmani&lt;/a&gt; attempted to preach the Mangala Sutta at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lohapasada,Lohapāsāda')"&gt;Lohapāsāda&lt;/a&gt;, but he was too nervous to proceed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Mangala Sutta was one of the incidents of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; life represented in the Relic Chamber of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahathupa,Mahā Thūpa')"&gt;Mahā Thūpa&lt;/a&gt; (Mhv.xxx.  83).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamangala_jat_453,Mahāmangala Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāmangala Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maddakucchi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park near Rājagaha, at the foot of Gijjhakūta.  It was a preserve (migadāya) where deer and game could dwell in safety.  When Devadatta, wishing to kill the Buddha, hurled a rock down Gijjhakūta, it was stopped midway by another rock, but a splinter from it fell on the Buddha's foot, wounding it severely.  As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvaka-ambavana, where he was treated by Jivaka (Vin.ii.193f.; DhA.ii.164ff.; J.iv.430; Mil.179).  It is said (S.i.27f) that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities.  Māra tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (S.i.110; this visit of Māra is referred to at D.ii.116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (e.g., S.A.i.61; cp.  J.iii.121f), Maddakucchi was so called because it was there that Bimbisāra's queen, mother of Ajātasattu, tried to bring about an abortion when she was told by soothsayers that the child in her womb was destined to bring about Bimbisāra's death.  She went into the park unknown to the king and violently massaged her womb, but without success.  The king heard of this and forbade her to visit the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Mahā Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of uposatha, he himself being pure.  The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing (Vin.i.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddakucchi was difficult of access monks; who came from afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta's powers to the test, would often ask him to provide lodging there for them.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Matarodana Jātaka (No.  317)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in a family worth eighty crores.  When his parents died, his brother managed the estate.  Some time later the brother also died, but the Bodhisatta shed no tear.  His relations and friends called him heartless, but he convinced them that he did not weep because he knew that all things are transient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a landowner of Sāvatthi who gave himself up to despair on the death of his brother.  The Buddha visited him and preached to him, and the man became a sotāpanna.  J.iii.56 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

It is said that he preferred to live where no conveniences, except food, were available, and before long he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a bird named Kakudha living on a lake, and, seeing the Buddha walking along the edge of the lake, he offered him kumudu flowers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixteen kappas ago he was king eight times under the name of Varuna (Thag.vs.105; ThagA.i.210f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Kumudadāyaka of the Apadāna.

Mānatthaddha.  &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of Sāvatthi who, because of his great pride respected no one.  One day he came upon the Buddha preaching to a large crowd of people and stood near, on one side.  The Buddha, seeing him, preached on the vanity of pride; Mānatthaddha understood, and, falling at the Buddha's feet, worshipped him.  And then, in answer to his question, the Buddha told him of those to whom respect should be shown, among whom the arahants are perfect.  Mānatthaddha became the Buddha's follower.  S.i.177f; cp.  Jenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mānatthaddha.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Buddha mentioned in a nominal list.  M.iii.71; ApA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

During the Akkhakkhāyika famine, Dutthagāmanī provided him and four others with a dish of sour millet gruel, which was purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the king's earrings (Mhv.xxxii.30).  Mahādeva took his portion to Sumanakūta and shared it with nine hundred others (Mhv.xxxii.49).  He was also among the eight arahants who accepted a meal of pork from Sāliya in his previous birth as a blacksmith (MT.606).  He was probably so called because he lived at Kotapabbata in the Malaya country.  MT.606 he is called Kotapabbatavāsika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that for three years after his ordination Mahādeva lived in the Maindalārāmaka vihāra (Mahādeva called Maliyadeva in the context (AA.i.22), but further on in the same passage (p.23) he is addressed as Mahādeva).  One day, while going for alms in Kallagāma, near by, he was invited by an upāsikā to her dwelling, where she gave him a meal, and, regarding him as a son, invited him to take all his meals at her home.  The invitation was accepted, and each day, after the meal, he would return thanks with the words "May you be happy and free from sorrow" (sukham hotu, dukkhā mucca).  At the end of the rainy season he became an arahant, and the chief incumbent of the Vihāra entrusted him with the task of preaching to the assembled people on the Pavārana Day.  The young novices informed the upāsikā that her "son" would preach that day, but she, thinking they were making fun of her, said that not everyone could preach.  But they persuaded her to go to the vihāra, and, when the turn of Maliyadeva came, he preached all through the night.  At dawn he stopped, and the upāsikā became a sotāpanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maliyadeva once preached the Cha Chakka Sutta in the Lohāpāsāda, and sixty monks, who listened to him, became arahants.  He also preached the same sutta in the Mahāmandapa, in the Mahāvihāra, at Cetīyapabbata, at Sākyavamsa vihāra, at Kutāli vihāra, at Antara-sobbha, Mutingana, Vātakapabbata, Pācīnagharaka, Dīghavāpī, Lokandara, and Gamendavāla, and, at each place, sixty monks attained arahantship.  At Cittalapabbata he saw a monk of over sixty preparing to bathe at Kuruvakatittha, and asked permission to bathe him.  The Elder, discovering from his conversation that he was Maliyadeva, agreed to let him do so, though, he said, no one had ever touched his body during sixty years.  Later in the day, the Elder begged Maliyadeva to preach to him, and this he did.  Sixty monks, all over sixty, were among the audience, and at the conclusion of the Cha Chakka Sutta they all became arahants.  The same thing happened at Tissamahāvihāra, Kalyāni vihāra, Nāgamahāvihara, Kalacchagāma, and at other places, sixty in all (MA.ii.1024f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaya Mahādeva was among those various large groups who renounced the world in the company of the Bodhisatta: the Kuddālasamāgama, Mūgapakkha samāgama, Cūlasutasoma samāgama, Ayogharapandita samāgama and Hatthipāla samāgama (J.iv.490; also vi.30, where Mahāmaliyadeva is called Kālavelavāsī).  It is said (Vsm.241) that two monks once asked Malaya Mahādeva for a subject of meditation, and that he gave them the formula of the thirty two parts of the body.  Though versed in the three Nikāyas, the monks could not become sotāpannas until they had recited the formula for a period of four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Magga Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Magga Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells the monks how, as he meditated under the Ajapāla nigrodha, the conviction came to him that the only way to Nibbāna was the cultivation of the four satipatthānas.  The Brahmā Sahampatī read his thoughts, and, appearing before him, confirmed this view.  S.v.167f.; 185f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Magga Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells the monks how, while yet a Bodhisatta, he discovered the method of cultivation of the iddhi-pādas.  S.v.281.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Magga Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Wrong view, wrong aim, wrong speech and wrong action lead one to purgatory, their opposites to heaven.  Likewise with livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration.  A.ii.227.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Magga Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The man who has wrong view, aim, speech and action, is censured by the wise.  A.ii.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Majjhantika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He recited the kammavācā (or ecclesiastical act) at the ordination of Mahinda, on whom he later conferred the upasampadā ordination (Mhv.v.207; Sp.i.51; Dpv.vii.24).  Later, at the conclusion of the Third Council, Majjhantika went as preacher to Kasmīra Gandhāra.  There, by his great iddhi powers, he overcame the Nāga king Aravāla and converted him to the Faith, while Pandaka and his wife Hāritā and their five hundred sons became sotāpannas.  Majjhantika preached the Āsīvisopama Sutta to the assembled concourse and later ordained one hundred thousand persons (Mhv.xii.3, 9ff.; Sp.i.64ff.; Dpv.viii.4; Mbv.113; for the Tibetan version see Rockhill, op.  cit., 167ff.).  The sermon preached by Majjhantika is referred to in the Scholiast to the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same Elder is referred to elsewhere as an example of one who practised pariyatti appicchatā (SNA.ii.494; DA.iii.1061, but at AA.i.263 he is called Majjhantika Tissa).  He was the leader of the assembly of monks (sanghathera).  On the day of the dedication of Asoka's vihāra, the Thera was a khīnāsava and was present, but his begging bowl and robe were hardly worth a farthing.  People, seeing him there, asked him to make way; but he sank into the earth, rising to receive the alms given to the leader of the monks, knowing that he alone was fit to accept it.  The story is given at AA.i.43; MA.i.350.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mattakundali, Matthakundali&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka.  His father loved him dearly, but was a great miser, and made for him, with his own hands, a pair of burnished ear rings in order to save the goldsmith's fee; the boy thus came to be called Mattakundali (burnished ear rings).  When he was sixteen he had an attack of jaundice.  His father refused to call in a physician, and prescribed for him himself till the boy was beyond all cure.  Then he carried him out and laid him on the terrace, lest those who came to prepare for the funeral should see his wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha saw Mattakundali as he lay dying, and, out of compassion, came to the door of his father's house.  Too weak to do anything else, the boy conjured up devout faith in the Buddha; he died soon after, and was born among the gods in a golden mansion thirty leagues in extent.  When he surveyed his past birth, he saw his father in the charnel ground, weeping and lamenting and preparing to cremate his body.  Assuming the form of Mattakundali, he went himself to the charnel ground and, standing near, started to weep.  When questioned by Adinnapubbaka, he said he wanted the moon, and in the course of conversation he revealed his identity and censured his father.  Adinnapubbaka invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, and, when it was over, asked if it were possible to attain to heaven by a mere act of faith.  In order to convince him, the Buddha made Mattakundali appear before him and confirm his statement that this was so.  At the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, both Adinnapubbaka and Mattakundali became sotāpannas, and eighty thousand persons realized the Truth (Mil.350).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DhA.i.20ff.; Vv.vii.9; VvA.322ff.; Pv.ii.5; PvA.92; the stanzas found in Mattakundali's story occur also in the Mattakundali Jātaka (q.v.), but the introductory story is quite different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māratajjanīya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiftieth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya.  While &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; is living at&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava,Bhesakalāvana')"&gt;Bhesakalāvana&lt;/a&gt;, Māra enters his belly and worries him.  When Māra realizes that Moggallāna has discovered him and can read his thoughts, he leaves his body and perches on the door bar of his cell.  Moggallāna then addresses him and tells him how, once, he himself was a Māra named Dūsī, and roused the brahmin householders against Kakusandha Buddha and his disciples.  As a result of this, Dūsī was born in Mahāniraya and suffered great torments.  Moggallāna warns Māra against assailing holy men lest he suffer a similar fate.  Māra retires discomfited.  M.i.332-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mallaka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Elder.  As he stood one day looking at a ploughed field a sign arose in him of the size of the field.  He enlarged it, induced the five jhānas, and, developing insight, became an arahant (Vsm.123).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is mentioned as consulting Dīghabhānaka Abhaya on some problem connected with jhāna.  Vsm.265f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Manikundala Jātaka (No.  351)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, born as king of Benares, discovering that one of his ministers had intrigued in his harem, expelled him from the kingdom.  The minister took up service under the king of Kosala, and, as a result of his conspiracy, the Bodhisatta was taken captive and cast into prison (J.iii.153ff).  For the rest of the story see Ekarāja Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a councillor of Pasenadi who was guilty of misconduct in the harem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Manihīra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Manihīra.&lt;/b&gt; A vihāra built by Mahāsena.  Mhv.xxxvil.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Manihīra.&lt;/b&gt; A tank built by Mahāsena (Mhv.xxxvii.47).  Aggabodhi built a canal leading out of it (Cv.xlii.34); so did Sena II.  (Cv.li.72).  Among the canals flowing into the tank was the Tilavatthuka, restored by Vijayabāhu I.  (Cv.lx.53).  Parakkamabāhu I.  rebuilt the tank (Cv.lxxix.31), and constructed the Kālindī Canal to carry away the overflow from the south side (Cv.xlii.54).  It was near this tank that Sanghatissa was taken prisoner by the followers of Moggallāna III.  Cv.xliv.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mārakāyika devi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of devas, evidently followers of Māra, who were credited by the Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas with making arahants discharge seminal fluid, though neither the arahants nor the devas themselves were guilty of physical impurity (Kvu.  164f.).  One of these devas once entered the bodies of five hundred women, friends of Visākhā, made them drunk, and caused them to commit gross improprieties in the presence of the Buddha.  DhA.iii.102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Majjhimadesa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country of Central India which was the birthplace of Buddhism and the region of its early activities.  It extended in the east to the town of Kajangala, beyond which was Mahāsāla; on the south-east to the river Salalavatī; on the south west to the town of Satakannika; on the west to the brahmin village of Thūna; on the north to the Usiraddhaja Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.197; J.i.49, 80; Mbv.12; Dvy.21f, extends the eastern boundary to include Pundavardhana, roughly identical with North Bengal.  It is interesting to note that in early Brahminical literature (e.g.  the Dharmasūtra of Baudhāyana), Āryāvarta, which is practically identical with what came to be called Madhyadesa, is described as lying to the east of the region where the Sarasvatī disappears, to the west of the Kālakavana, to the north of Pāripātra, and to the south of the Himālaya.  This excludes the whole of Magadha (Baudhāyana i.  1, 2, 9, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also noteworthy that in the Commentaries the Majjhimadesa is extended to include the whole of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;, the other continents being Paccantima-janapadā.  The term came also to be used in a generic sense.  Thus, in Ceylon (Tambapannidīpa) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"&gt;Anurādhapura&lt;/a&gt; came to be called the Majjhimadesa (AA.i.165).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhimadesa was three hundred yojanas in length, two hundred and fifty in breadth, and nine hundred in circumference (DA.i.173).  It contained fourteen of the sixteen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanapada,Mahājanapadas')"&gt;Mahājanapadas&lt;/a&gt;, that is to say all but Gandhāra and Kamboja, which belonged to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaraapatha,Uttarāpatha')"&gt;Uttarāpatha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Majjhimadesa were regarded as wise and virtuous (J.iii.115, 116).  It was the birthplace of noble men (purisājanīyā) including the Buddhas (DhA.iii.248; AA.i.265), and all kinds of marvellous things happened there (SNA.i.197).  The people of Majjhimadesa considered peacocks' flesh a luxury.  VibhA.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Madhumamsadāyaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety one kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a pig sticker of Bandhumatī, and one day gave as alms to an Elder a bowl of tender flesh.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was reborn after death in Tāvatimsa.  Ap.ii.372.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mandākinī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven great lakes of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava,Himālaya')"&gt;Himālaya&lt;/a&gt;.  Their names are given at J.v.415; A.iv.101; SNA.ii.407; DA.i.164; UdA.300; AA.ii.759. At Vsm.416, the name Tiyaggalā is substituted for Mandākinī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chaddanta,Chaddantavana')"&gt;Chaddantavana&lt;/a&gt; and is fifty leagues in extent, of which twenty-five leagues is of crystal water, free from moss or weeds.  For the next twenty five leagues, the water is but waist deep and is covered with white lotus, spreading for half a league around the lake; beyond that are red lotus, red lilies, etc., rice fields, fruit trees, a grove of sugar cane - each cane being as big as a palm tree banana, jak, mango, rose apple, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bank of the lake is a spot where Pacceka Buddha's generally live; but &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annaa_kondanna,Aññā-Kondañña')"&gt;Aññā-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; lived there for twelve years attended by Chaddanta, the elephant and Nāgadatta, a devaputta.  They ministered to all his needs, and he only left there to take leave of the Buddha before his death.  He then returned to Mandākinī, where he died and was cremated, his relics being later deposited at the gateway of Veluvana, where a cetiya was erected over them.  SA.i.217ff.; but see ThagA.ii.3, where he is said to have lived on the bank of the Chaddantadaha; Mandākinī may have been another name for the same lake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mandākinī Lake never grows hot and dries up only at the end of the kappa.

Māgha.&lt;/b&gt; A youth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  He visited the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta,Gijjhakūta')"&gt;Gijjhakūta&lt;/a&gt; and asked if he would gain greatly by the gifts he made to various people, gifts which were rightly obtained.  The Buddha answered that his gifts would bear great fruit.  At the end of the Buddha's discourse, Māgha became his follower.  SN.  pp.  86ff.; SNA.ii.413ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Māgha.  &lt;/b&gt; See Sakka and Magha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Māgha.&lt;/b&gt; A usurper from Kālinga who came to Ceylon with a band of Kerala warriors in about 1215 A.C., deposed the reigning king, Parakkamapandu II., blinded him, and occupied the throne at Pulatthipura.  Being a bigoted Hindu, he destroyed the Buddhist religious buildings and burnt their books.  He persecuted the people in various ways and distributed their land among his warriors.  He ruled for twenty one years, and seems to have been succeeded at Pulatthipura by Jayabāhu (q.v.) (Cv.lxxx.58ff).  During part of his reign, Vijayabāhu III.  (q.v.) ruled over a portion of Ceylon.

The king, pleased with his demeanour, invited him into the palace and asked him to spend the rainy season in the park.  The king had an ill-natured son, named Dutthakumāra, and despairing of ever being able to reform him, handed him over, as a last resort, to the ascetic.  One day, when the ascetic was walking about in the garden with the prince, he asked him to taste the leaf of a young Nimba-plant.  The prince did so, but at once spat it out, because of its intense bitterness.  "If such bitterness should reside in the baby-tree, how will it be when it grows up?" said the Bodhisatta, and thereupon drew a moral with regard to the prince's own conduct.  The prince benefited by the lesson, and thenceforth changed his nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a Licchavi-Kumāra called Duttha.  J.i.504-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekapindadāyikā Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety-one kappas ago she was the wife of King Bandhumā, of Bandhumatī.  Wishing to do some good deed to ensure for herself a happy rebirth, she asked the king for his sanction, and fed a nun and gave her various gifts.  Later she was born thirty times in Tāvatimsa as queen of the gods.  She was the wife of twenty kings among men (Ap.ii.515f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably identical with Mettā Therī (ThigA.36f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekadamsaniya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he was named Nārada-Kesava.  He heard the Buddha preach and, gladdened by the sermon, did him homage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen kappas ago he became a king under the name of Amittatāpana (v.l.  Amittavāsana?) (Ap.i.168f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Pavittha Thera.  ThagA.i.185.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekarāja Jātaka (No.  303)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekaraaja_jat_303,Ekarāja')"&gt;Ekarāja&lt;/a&gt; (1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the circumstances relating to the story see&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/seyya_jat_282,Seyyamsa Jātaka')"&gt;Seyyamsa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Elakamāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  The king of Kosala invaded his father's kingdom and, having killed the king, took away the queen, who was pregnant.  When the child was born he was cast into the cemetery lest he should be slain by the Kosala king.  The boy was discovered by a goatherd and brought up as his son, but from the day of the boy's arrival in the goatherd's home, the latter's animals began to die off.  He was therefore named Elakamāra ("Goat's Bane").  The goatherd, thereupon, put him into a pot and cast him into the river, where he was picked up by a low-caste mender of old rubbish and adopted as his son.  When he grew up the boy went to the palace with his father, and there the princess Kurangavī, of great beauty, fell in love with him.  The servants discovered them guilty of illicit relations and reported them to the king.  When the lad was about to be put to death for his misdemeanour, the queen; possessed by the spirit of Elakamāra's dead father, who had been born as his guardian angel, confessed that he was no mere outcaste, but the son of the king of Benares.  The Kosala king restored to Elakamāra his father's inheritance and married him to Kurangavī.  Chalangakumāra was given to him as his teacher, and was later appointed commander-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurangavī misbehaved with Chalangakumāra as well as with his servant, Dhanantevāsī (J.v.430ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Elakamāra was one of the stories mentioned by Kunāla in his famous sermon on the frailty of women (J.v.424).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekabbohārā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the divisions of the Mahāsanghikas (Dpv.v.40; Mhv.v.4).  They were so called because they held that "all the doctrines are understood by a unique and immediate wisdom, for all the doctrines of the Buddha are comprehended by the intellect." (Mhv.187f).  They held, among other things, that the Tathāgathas were not subject to worldly laws, that the Dhammacakkas of all Tathāgathas did not agree; the Bodhisatta did not pass through the successive stages of embryonic development; that he is born at will among inferior beings for the salvation of mankind; with our wisdom the four truths are perfectly understood; he who has perfectly acquired right restraint has cast off all yoga (attachment).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Esukārī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Esukārī.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin who visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him various questions on castes and their distinctions, from the point of view of their functions.  The Buddha replies that birth's invidious bar has been laid down by the brahmins, without consulting anybody else; all four castes alike can live the good life, which is the true service, and follow the Dhamma, which is the true wealth.  At the end of the discourse Esukārī declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.177ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Esukārī.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He and his chaplain were great friends; neither of them had any sons.  They agreed that if either of them should have a son the possessions of both should be given to him.  By the intercession of a tree-sprite the chaplain had four sons - Hatthipāla, Assapāla, Gopāla, and Ajapāla.  But when they grew up, one after the other, they renounced the world, and were later joined by the chaplain and the king, with all their retinues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esukārī was a previous birth of Suddhodana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is related in the Hatthipāla Jātaka.  J.iv.473ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekapundarīka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ekapundarīka.-A paribbājakārāma, the residence of Vacchagotta (M.i.481f ).It was near the Kūtāgārasālā in the Mahāvana of Vesāli.  The Buddha went there to see Vacchagotta, and it was on this occasion that the Tevijja-Vacchagotta Sutta was preached (M.i.481f).  Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.673) that the place was so called because in it grew a solitary White Mango Tree (setambarukkha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ekapundarīka.-An elephant belonging to Pasenadi.  It was while riding on this elephant that the king met Ananda.  The king followed the Elder to the monastery, and their conversation is recorded in the Bāhitika Sutta (M.ii.112f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the elephant's ribs there was a white spot (pandaratthāna), the size of a palmyra-fruit, hence his name (MA.ii.752).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Ekapundarīka Thera.-An arahant.  Ninety-four kappas ago he met the Pacceka Buddha, Romasa, and gave him a lotus-flower as an offering of homage.  Ap.i.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekapada Jātaka (No.  238)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was born as a rich merchant in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  One day his son, sitting on his lap, asked him for one word which comprehended all things.  The Bodhisatta said it was "skill" (dakkhayya).  The story was told in reference to a lad in Sāvatthi who asked his father "the Dvārapañha" (question regarding the entrance to the Path).  The father, not being able to answer the boy, brought him to the Buddha.  J.ii.236f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekadīpiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekadīpiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  Ninety-four kappas ago he kept a lamp lighted all night near the thūpa built over the relics of Siddhattha Buddha.  For seventy-seven kappas he was in heaven and was thirty-one times king of the devas.  Twenty-eight times be was king among men.  His body shone like the sun, and he could see a distance of one hundred leagues.  His palace in heaven was called Ekadīpi.  He entered the Order at the age of four (?) and in a fortnight became an arahant.  Ap.ii.373.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekadīpiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  In the past he had lighted a lamp before the salala-bodhi of the Buddha Padumuttara.  Sixteen thousand kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Candābha.  Ap.i.189.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekapattadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the past, ninety-one kappas ago, he was a potter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hamsavatii,Hamsavatī')"&gt;Hamsavatī&lt;/a&gt;, and once gave a well-made bowl of clay to the Buddha.  As a result, he always had his food in gold and silver bowls (Ap.ii.444).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cunda,Mahācunda Thera')"&gt;Mahācunda Thera&lt;/a&gt;.  See ThagA.i.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Ekadhamma Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-There is no other single condition which, when developed, is conducive to the abandonment of bonds as much as the seven bojjhangas.  S.v.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekadhamma Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-There is one condition which, if cultivated, yields great fruit, viz., the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing.  The sutta also describes the method of its practice.  S.v.311f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He had only one son, of whom he was extremely fond.  One day when the king was enjoying himself in the royal park, the boy was suddenly taken ill and died at once.  Lest the king should die of a broken heart, the ministers did not tell him for two days.  The king thereupon reflected on the nature of death and developing insight became a Pacceka Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verse is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta.  Sn.v.41; SnA.i.85f; ApA.i.138.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekūposathikā Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arahant.  In the past she was a slave-girl, a water-carrier in the city of Bandhumatī.  Seeing the King Bandhumā keeping the fast, she took the precepts herself and kept them well.  Sixty-four times she became the queen of rulers in heaven, and was sixty-three times queen among men.  Her complexion was always of a golden hue.  In her last life she left the world at the age of seven, and attained arahantship within eight months (Ap.ii.522f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is probably identical with Uttamā Therī.  See ThigA.46ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Erakapatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nāga king.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk.  One day, while in a boat, he grasped an eraka-leaf, and through his failing to let go, the leaf was broken off.  Though he practised meditation for twenty thousand years in the forest, at the moment of his death he thought of the lapse with great remorse and was reborn in the Nāga world as large as a dug-out canoe, much to his grief and despair.  When a daughter was born to him he taught her a song and, once a fortnight, he appeared with her on the surface of the Ganges, where she danced on his hood and sang the song.  She was offered in marriage to anyone who could sing a reply to her song.  Erakapatta hoped thereby to become aware of it when a Buddha should appear in the world.  Many suitors came, and an interval between two Buddhas passed and still no one was successful.  At last a young brahmin, Uttara (q.v.), well-schooled for the task by the Buddha, appeared before the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nāga-maiden and answered all her questions.  (Uttara himself became a sotāpanna when he finished learning his lesson from the Buddha.) Erakapatta at once knew that a Buddha had come, and asked Uttara to take him to the Teacher.  At the sight of the Buddha, Erakapatta was seized with great sorrow on account of his condition, but the Buddha preached to him and consoled him.  It is said that the Nāga king would have attained the Fruit of Conversion had it not been for his animal nature.  DhA.iii.230-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekanālā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin village near Dakkhinagiri, to the south of Rājagaha.  Once, during the eleventh year of his ministry, the Buddha visited the village and preached to Kāsī-Bhāradvāja the sutta which bears his name and which converted him to the faith (Sn.pp.12ff; SnA.i.136; S.i.172ff).  Near the village was the Dakkhinagiri-vihāra.  SA.i.188.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekāsanadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekāsanadāyaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic named Nārada-Kassapa, living near the mountain Kosika.  Once he saw the Buddha walking through the forest, and having provided him with a seat, spoke words in praise of him.  The Buddha preached to him a short sermon.  Fifty times Ekāsanadāyaka became king of the gods and eighty times he ruled over men.  Wherever he wished he could find a seat, even in the forest or in a river (Ap.ii.381f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekāsanadāyaka.&lt;/b&gt;-A Thera.  In the time of Padumuttara, he, with his wife, left the deva-world, and coming amongst men waited upon a monk named Devala (Ap.i.226).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Erāpatha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A royal family of Nāgas, mentioned together with Virūpakkhas, Chabbyāputtas, and Kanhagotamakas, all of them described as "Nāgarājakulāni." (J.ii.145) For their own protection, monks are advised to fill their hearts with amity for these four classes of Nāgas.  A.ii.72; Vin.ii.109f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekuddāna (Ekuddāniya) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was the son of a wealthy brahmin of Sāvatthi, and being convinced of the Buddha's majesty, as seen at the presentation of the Jetavana, he entered the Order.  He dwelt in the forest fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him.  The Buddha, seeing Sāriputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 259).  The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon reflected on it.  He thus came to be called Ekuddāniya.  One day he obtained insight and became an arahant.  Later, when Ananda asked him to preach a sermon, it was this stanza that he took as his text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that in the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities.  A disciple of the Buddha, named Sāgara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the Buddha's thūpa.  In Kassapa's time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha utter the stanza mentioned above.  He entered the Order, and for twenty thousand years practised meditation, repeating the stanza, but gained no attainment (ThagA.i.153f; Thag.v.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.iii.384f) that on fast-days Ekuddāna, alone in the forest, sounded the call for the deities of the forest to attend the preaching of the Law, and uttered his stanza, whereupon the deities made loud applause.  One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, visited Ekuddāna with a retinue of five hundred each.  Seeing them, Ekuddāna's heart was glad and he said: "Today we will listen to the Law." On being asked for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest grove was filled with the applause of devas.  Thereupon one of the Elders recited the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound.  In order to dispel their doubts, Ekuddāna took his seat and pronounced his one stanza.  The sound of the plaudits of the devas filled the forest.  The Elders were greatly offended at the conduct of the devas and complained to the Buddha.  The Buddha explained to them that the important thing was not the amount of knowledge but the quality of the understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the verse, attributed above to Ekuddāniya, occurs in the Vinaya (Vin.iv.54) as having been constantly used by Cūlapanthaka.  Whenever it was his turn to preach to the nuns at Sāvatthi they expected no effective lesson, since he always repeated the same stanza, namely, that which is above attributed to Ekuddāniya.  The thera, bearing of their remarks, forthwith gives an exhibition of his iddhi-power and of his knowledge of the Dhamma, thereby winning their tribute of admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekavihāriya &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ekavihāriya Thera.-An arahant.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he entered the Order and dwelt in solitude.  In this life, too, he was fond of dwelling alone.  Ap.ii.390f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ekavihāriya.-A monk greatly famed for his love of solitude.  When they told the Buddha of him, the Buddha sang his praises in the midst of the assembly.  DhA.iii.471f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Ekavihāriya.-See Tissakumāra, brother of Asoka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Erāvana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Erāvana.&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka's&lt;/a&gt; elephant.  He was once the elephant of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, who gave him to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha,Māgha')"&gt;Māgha&lt;/a&gt; and his companions to help them in their good works on earth.  As a result, when Magha and the others were reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, Erāvana was born there himself and became their companion.  Ordinarily he was a deva like the others, because there are no animals in the deva-world, but when they went to the park to play, Erāvana assumed the form of an elephant, one hundred and fifty leagues in size.  For the thirty-three devas Erāvana erected thirty-three heads (kumbha), each two or three quarters of a league in girth.  Each head had seven tusks, each fifty leagues long, each tusk bore seven lotus plants, each plant seven flowers, each flower seven leaves, and on each leaf danced seven nymphs (Padumaceharā).  For Sakka himself there was a special head, Sudassana, thirty leagues around, above it a canopy of twelve leagues all of precious stones.  In the centre was a jewelled couch one league long, on which Sakka reclined in state.  DhA.i.273f; also SnA.i.368f.  (where there are a few slight variations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammika_v_s,Dhammika Sutta')"&gt;Dhammika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (Sn.v.379) Erāvana is mentioned among the devas who visited the Buddha to pay him homage.  He is also mentioned among the Nāgas present at the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s,Mahāsamaya Sutta')"&gt;Mahāsamaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.258; perhaps here a king of snakes is meant, because he is mentioned with others who are avowedly snakes).  It is emphasised in several places (E.g., MA.i.472; DA.ii.688; also VvA.15 and Kvu.ii.599) that Erāvana is a devaputta and a Nāga only by birth (jātiyā).  The Jātakas (J.v.137) mention Sakka as riding Erāvana, particularly when making comparisons between kings parading on the backs of elephants (E.g., V.iii.392).  Erāvana is one of the chief features of Tāvatimsa (V.vi.278).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Ninety-two kappas ago he provided a place of residence for the Buddha Tissa in an udumbara-grove and spread for him a carpet of flowers and paid homage to him with clasped hands.  Once he was a king, called Ekañjalika.  Ap.i.236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekañjalika Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.

In the time of Padumuttara Buddha be was a grass-cutter of Hamsavatī and gave to the Buddha his only upper garment.  As a result he reigned in heaven thirty-six times and was king of men thirty-three times.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had the power of obtaining garments at will wherever he happened to be.  Ap.ii.379f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Elāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Anurādhapura (145-101 B.C.) He was a native of Cola, and having come to Ceylon, overpowered the reigning king, Asela, and captured the throne.  The Mahāvamsa says (Mhv.xxi.14f ) that he ruled with "even justice towards friend and foe," and many stories are related showing his love of fairness and his kindness.  Although an unbeliever, he paid the greatest respect to Buddhism, and he is credited with having persuaded the gods, by his determination, to send rain over his kingdom only at convenient times.  Elāra had a general named Mitta (Mhv.xxiii.4); the chief of his forces was Dīghajantu, while his royal elephant was called Mahāpabbata.  In the great battle between Elāra's forces and the Sinhalese soldiers under Dutthagāmanī, Elāra was slain in single contest with the latter.  In recognition of the dead king's chivalry, great honours were paid to him at his funeral and a monument was erected over his ashes.  For many generations all music was stopped while passing the monument as a mark of respect to the honoured dead (Mhv.xxv.54-74; Dpv.xxiii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.  483), a shrine was erected on the spot where Elāra's ashes were buried, and it was called the Elārapatimāghara.  It was to the south of Anurādhapura, beyond the potters' village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river.  According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakabrahma_jat_405,Bakabrahma Jātaka')"&gt;Bakabrahma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, one of Baka's good deeds which brought him rebirth in the Brahma-world was that of having set free the inhabitants of a village on the banks of the Enī (Enikūle), when the village was raided.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baka,Baka')"&gt;Baka&lt;/a&gt; was then an ascetic named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava,Kesava')"&gt;Kesava&lt;/a&gt; and the Bodhisatta was his disciple Kappa.  S.i.143; J.iii.361; SA.i.163.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekasātaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very poor brahmin who lived in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  He was so called because he and his wife had, between them, only one upper garment, worn by whichever of them happened to be going out.  The Buddha was in the habit of preaching every seven years.  On one such occasion the brahmin listened to the Buddha's sermon, and being greatly pleased, wishing to make an offering, he gave the Buddha his upper garment after a hard mental struggle as to whether he could afford the gift.  Having made the gift, he shouted with joy saying, "I have won." The king of the city, Bandhumā, having heard the shout and learnt the reason, gave to the brahmin various rich gifts, including the sabbatthaka (*), all of which the latter presented to the Buddha, keeping, at the king's special request, a single pair of garments for himself and his wife.  The king later made Ekasātaka his chaplain (AA.i.92ff; also ThagA.ii.136).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sabbatthaka seems to have been a gift of various things in groups of eight: eight elephants, eight horses, eight thousand pieces of money, etc.  (DhA.iii.3); but see Mil.Trs.ii.147, n.1, where it is spoken of as an office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekasātaka is given in the Anguttara Commentary (loc.  cit.) as a previous birth of the Elder Mahā Kassapa.  The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.1ff) mentions another brahmin, Culla-Ekasātaka by name.  He is, however, stated as having lived in the time of Gotama Buddha, although the story related is, in most respects, identical with that given above, except that the king in the story of Culla-Ekasātaka is Pasenadi, king of Kosala.  No mention is made of the brahmin being created purohita.  Moreover, this brahmin received as gift only the sabbacatukka (groups of four) and not the sabatthaka.  More important still, Culla Ekasātaka is identified with Mahā Ekasātaka, the latter being mentioned as having lived in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  Here we evidently have a confusion of legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Ekasātaka is related in the Milindapañha (pp.115, 291), as one of seven cases in which an act of devotion received its reward in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekasaññaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekasaññaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  In the past he gave a meal to a monk named Khanda, a disciple of Vessabhū Buddha.  Forty kappas ago he was a king named Varuna (Ap.i.121).  The Apadāna Commentary says he was given the name Ekasaññaka because in his last life he remembered his gift to Khanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekasaññaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  Thirty-one kappas ago he saw a rag-robe hanging in the forest, and gladdened by the sight worshipped it.  Twenty-five kappas ago he was a king named Amitābha.  Ap.i.210f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

See KS.v.180, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekacāriya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  One hundred thousand kappas ago, when in Tāvatimsa, he heard sounds of great excitement because a Buddha had been born in the world.  He visited the Buddha on his death-bed and offered a mandārava-flower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty thousand kappas ago he was three times king under the name of Mahāmallajana.

In his retinue were Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindaki, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa, all of whom were also followers of the same teacher (A.ii.180f).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/enii,Enī')"&gt;Enī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enijangha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-One of the suttas in the Devatā-Samyutta.  A deva asks the Buddha how it is possible to wander indifferent to the calls of sense, limbed like the antelope (eni) or the lion.  The Buddha answers, by getting rid of the desires of sense.  S.i.16.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enikūla&lt;/b&gt;.-See Enī.  The scholiast to the Jātaka (J.iii.361) explains the name in the following way: "Eniyā nāma nadiyā kūle."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eniphassā&lt;/b&gt;.-A name, either of some kind of musical instrument or, more probably, of a class of celestial musicians who waited on Sakka and his queens.  Vv.xviii.11; i.26; VvA.94, 211; for explanation see 372.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erāhulu&lt;/b&gt;.-A locality in Ceylon, near which an engagement took place between the forces of Parakkamabāhu I., and his foes (Cv.lxxiv.91).  It is identified with the present district Eravur, north-west of Batticaloa.  Cv.Trs.ii.30, n.3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/eraka_th,Eraka Thera')"&gt;Eraka Thera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/erakapatta,Erakapatta')"&gt;Erakapatta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erakavassa, Erakavassakhanda&lt;/b&gt;.-A locality in Ceylon.  Ras.ii.181, 185.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erakāvilla&lt;/b&gt;.-A village in Rohana in Ceylon where King Mahāsena built a vihāra after destroying a temple of the unbelievers.  Mhv.xxxvii.41; MT.685.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erandagalla&lt;/b&gt;.-A tank built by Vijayabāhu I.

M.ii.177ff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Etadagga Vagga&lt;/b&gt;.-The fourteenth chapter of the Eka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya.  It contains the names of the Buddha's disciples, men and women, each distinguished by some special qualification.  A.i.23-6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Etam-mama Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-On how the view arises: "This is mine, this am I." S.iii.181.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Esanā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of suttas on the three kinds of longing (esanā) the longing for sensual delights, for becoming, for the holy life.  These are spoken of in relation to the Noble Eightfold Path (S.v.54f).  The same is repeated for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) the seven bojjhangas (S.v.136), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) the four satipatthānas (S.v.191), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) the indriyas (S.v.240, 242), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) the five balas (S.v.250, 252), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) the iddhi-pāddas (S.v.291), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6) the jhānas (S.v.309).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekavajjaka-Brahmadatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king.  He was extremely obliging, and would grant an interview to any who desired it, no matter what the circumstances.  He always allowed the person interviewing him to do so unattended, and thence came to be known as Ekavajjaka ("going alone").  Once, two of his ministers quarrelled because they wanted to rule over the same district.  The king, realising the evil effects of greed, developed insight and became a Pacceka Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verse is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta.  Sn.v.40; SnA.i.84f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry/>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekachattiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Atthadassī he was an ascetic with a large following, living on the banks of the Candabhāgā.  He visited the Buddha with his followers and held a white parasol over the Buddha's head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven kappas ago he lived in the deva-world as king of the devas.  He was king of men one thousand times (Ap.ii.367ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eraka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was the son of an eminent family of Sāvatthi.  He had many advantages over others, among them beauty and charm.  His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because it was his last life, he sought the Buddha.  After hearing the Buddha preach he left the world, but for several days he was overcome by evil thoughts.  The Buddha thereupon admonished him in a verse, and Eraka gained arahantship (Thag.v.93; ThagA.i.192f; for the name see Brethren, p.86, n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a householder.  One day he saw the Buddha and, having nothing to give, cleaned the road along which the Buddha walked and stood looking at him with clasped hands.  Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Suppabuddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Maggadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.173.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekarāja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekarāja.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He was the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;.  A minister, whom he expelled on the ground of misconduct in the royal harem, took service under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabbasena,Dabbasena')"&gt;Dabbasena&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, and incited him to make war on Ekarāja.  The latter was captured while sitting on the dais in the midst of his councillors and hanged head downwards by a cord from the lintel of a door.  In this position Ekarāja cultivated thoughts of loving-kindness towards his enemy and attained a stage of complete absorption in mystic meditation.  His bonds burst and he sat cross-legged in mid air.  Dabbasena was, meanwhile, seized with a burning pain in his body and, on the advice of his courtiers, had Ekarāja released, whereupon the pains disappeared.  Realising Ekarāja's holiness, Dabbasena restored the kingdom to him and asked his forgiveness (J.iii.13-15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ekaraaja_jat_303,Ekarāja Jātaka')"&gt;Ekarāja Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, reference is made to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasilava_jat_051,Mahāsīlava Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāsīlava Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; for details regarding the expulsion of the minister for misconduct and of the subsequent events.  But there the king is called Sīlava and not Ekarāja.  The two stories contain certain similarities but the details vary very much.  See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/seyya_jat_282,Seyya Jātaka')"&gt;Seyya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, where the king is called&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamsa, and compare it with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghata_jat_355_454,Ghata Jātaka')"&gt;Ghata Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  The Ekarāja Jātaka is given as an example of a birth in which the Bodhisatta practised mettā to perfection (E.g., BuA.51; Mbv.11).  The story of Ekarāja is the last in the Cariyā-Pitaka (No.  xiv).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cariyā Pitaka Commentary (p.205), Ekarāja was a title given to the king on account of his great power, in which case his real name might have been Sīlava, as mentioned above.  The scholiast on the Ekarāja Jātaka (J.iii.14), however, says that Ekarāja was the king's personal name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekarāja.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Pupphavatī (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;).  He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vasavattii,Vasavatti')"&gt;Vasavatti&lt;/a&gt; and the father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakumaara,Candakumāra')"&gt;Candakumāra&lt;/a&gt;.  For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542,Khandahāla Jātaka')"&gt;Khandahāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.131ff).  He belonged to the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kondanna,Kondaññagotta')"&gt;Kondaññagotta&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.137).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekacintita&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekacintita.&lt;/b&gt;-Sixteen kappas ago there were eighteen kings of this name.  They were previous births of Sumangala Thera.  Ap.i.148; ThagA.i.111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekacintita Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  When in the deva-world, his term of life having come to an end, he was filled with anxiety as to where he should seek rebirth.  A disciple of Padumuttara, named Sumana, seeing his plight, advised him to seek refuge in the Buddha.  He followed the advice and escaped sorrow.  Ap.i.194f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ekadhammasavaniya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He was the son of a banker in Setavyā and he went to see the Buddha who was visiting the town and staying in the Simsapā-wood.  The Buddha preached to him on the impermanence of all component things and at the end of the sermon he became an arahant.  He received his name because he won insight by hearing the Dhamma only once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a tree-sprite and, coming across some monks who had lost their way, he looked after them, gave them food and directed them to their destination.  After the death of Kassapa Buddha, he was born as the son of Suyāma and great-grandson of Kikī and became king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; under the name of Kikī Brahmadatta.  Not finding anyone capable of preaching the Doctrine to him, he left his throne in disgust and started on his way to Himavā.  As he went along the road, Sakka appeared before him and quoted to him some lines on the impermanence of all things.  Satisfied therewith, the king returned to his capital (Thag.v.67; ThagA.i.151f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna verses regarding this Thera quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary are, in the Apadāna itself (i.152f), attributed to an Elder named Maggasaññaka, with whom he is evidently to be identified.  Five kappas ago he became king twelve times under the name of Sacakkhu.  v.l.  Ekadhammika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ekadhammasavaniya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  In the time of Padumuttara he was a Jatila of great power.  Once when journeying through the air he found his progress suddenly stopped and, on investigation, discovered that below him, on the ground, the Buddha was preaching.  He listened to the sermon, which dealt with impermanence, and, returning to his hermitage, meditated on this topic.  Later he was born in Tāvatimsa.  Fifty-one times he reigned as king of heaven for thirty thousand kappas and twenty-one times he was king of men.  In this last life he heard a monk in his father's house preaching a sermon in reference to the impermanence of all component things.  At the end of the sermon he remembered his former attainments and, seated there, reached arahantship.  He was only seven years old at the time.  Ap.ii.385.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upatissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upatissa.-The personal name of Sāriputta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upatissa.-Purohita to Vijaya, king of Ceylon.  He founded a settlement at Upatissagāma.  Mhv.vii.44; Dpv.ix.32, 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upatissa I.-King of Ceylon.  He reigned for forty-two years between A.C.  362 and 409. He was the eldest son of Buddhadāsa.  He was of very kindly disposition and lived a simple life, eating of the food served in the Mahāpāli alms-hall.  It is said that once, when the roof of his palace started leaking at night, he lay all night in the wet, being loth to disturb any of the servants.  During a period of drought and famine, he organised a religious festival, causing rain to fall.  He built the Rajuppala, Gijjhakūta, Pokkharapāsaya, Valāhassa, Ambutthi and Gondigāma tanks and the Khandarāja Vihāra, besides hospitals and almshouses for women in travail, the blind and the sick.  He was murdered by his queen-consort, who had an intrigue with his younger brother, Mahānāma.  For an account of Upatissa's reign see Cv.i.37, 179ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Upatissa II.-King of Ceylon.  He was the husband of the sister of Moggallāna I.  and was his general.  He killed Sīva I, and became king, his reign lasting only one year and a half (A.C.  522-24).  He had a son Kassapa, called Girikassapa by virtue of his prowess, and a daughter who married Silākāla.  Silākāla became a rebel and seized Upatissa's kingdom.  (For an account of Upatissa see Cv.xli.5f).  Upatissa belonged to the Lambakanna clan, and in Sinhalese writing is called Lāmāni-upatissa (Cv.Trs.i.52, n.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Upatissa.-Son of Silākāla and brother of Dāthāpabhuti and Moggallāna II.  He was a good-looking young man and was his father's favourite.  He was killed by Dāthāpabhuti (Cv.xli.33ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Upatissa Thera.-Called Pāsānadīpavāsī Upatissa.  He appears to have written a Commentary on the Mahāvamsa, which the author of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā used for his own work, sometimes criticising its comments.  See, e.g., MT.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Upatissa.-Thera of Tambapapidīpa (Ceylon), perhaps to be identified with No.  6 above.  He and his colleague, Phussadeva, are often mentioned as being expert exponents of the Vinaya.  Upatissa had two pupils, Mahāpaduma and Mahāsumma, who became very famous as vinayadharā.  Mahāpaduma "read" through the Vinaya eighteen times with his teacher, and Mahāsumma nine times (Sp.i.263f).  Buddhaghosa evidently regarded with great respect the explanations of various Vinaya questions as given by Upatissa, for he often quotes him.  See, e.g., Sp.ii.456; iii.624, 714; iv.890.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Upatissa.-Sāriputta's father and chieftain of Nālaka or Upatissagāma (q.v.).  His proper name was Vanganta (q.v.), Upatissa being, evidently, his clan name (SnA.i.326).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Pāli Mahābodhi-vamsa.  He lived in Ceylon, probably in the tenth century.  For details see P.L.C.  156ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Upatissa Thera.-He wrote a commentary on Kassapa's Anāgatavamsa.  Gv.p.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. Upatissa.-A Pacceka Buddha, found in a nominal list (M.iii.69).  The name is also found in the Apadāna (i.280; ii.454).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. Upatissa Thera.-Sometimes called Arahā Upatissa, author of the Vimuttimagga (P.L.C.  86).  He probably lived about the first century B.C.  J.P.T.S.  1919, pp.69ff; see also NidA.  (P.T.S.); introd.  vi f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13. Upatissa Thera.-Author of the Saddhammappajjotikā, the commentary on the Mahā Niddesa, written at the request of Deva Thera (NidA.ii.108).  His residence was on the western side of the Mahā Cetiya within the precincts of the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura, and it was built by a minister, Kittissena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some MSS.  give the author's name as Upasena.  For his age, see Saddhammappajjotikā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uparevata&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uparevata.-A sāmanera, son of Padumuttara Buddha.  It was the sight of this novice which made Rāhula, then born as the Nāga-king Sankha, wish to become a Buddha's son (SnA.i.340; MA.ii.722).  According to the Buddhavamsa (xi.21), however, Padumuttara's son was called Uttara.  Uparevata, though very young in years (tarunalalitadāraka), was possessed of great iddhi-powers and the Nāga-king was greatly impressed by him (AA.i.142f.  Here the nāga king is called Pathayindhara).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uparevata.-Nephew of Sāriputta.  When Sāriputta went to Nālaka on his last visit, in order to die there, Uparevata saw him outside the village, seated under a banyan tree.  He was asked to announce Sāriputta's arrival to the latter's mother, and to make preparations for accommodating Sāriputta's five hundred followers (DA.ii.551; SA.iii.175).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uppalavannā &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uppalavannā Therī.-One of the two chief women disciples of the Buddha.  She was born in Sāvatthi as the daughter of a banker, and she received the name of Uppalavannā because her skin was the colour of the heart of the blue lotus.  When she was come of age, kings and commoners from the whole of India sent messengers to her father, asking for her hand.  He, not wishing to offend any of them, suggested that Uppalavannā should leave the world.  Because of her upanissaya, she very willingly agreed and was ordained a nun.  Soon it came to her turn to perform certain services in the uposatha-hall.  Lighting the lamp, she swept the room.  Taking the flame of the lamp as her visible object, she developed tejokasina and, attaining to jhāna, became an arahant possessed of the four special attainments (patisambhidā).  She became particularly versed in the mystic potency of transformation (iddhivikubbana).  When the Buddha arrived at the Gandamba-tree to perform the Twin Miracle, Uppalavannā offered to perform certain miracles herself, if the Buddha would give his consent, but this he refused (ThigA.190, 195).  Later, at Jetavana, in the assembly of the Sangha, he declared her to be the chief of the women possessed of iddhi-power (A.i.25).  The Therīgāthā (vv.234-5) contains several verses attributed to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of them had been uttered in anguish by a mother who had been unwittingly living as her daughter's rival with the man who later became the monk Gangātīriya (q.v.).  Uppalavannā repeated them to help her to reflect on the harm and vileness of sensual desires.  Two others are utterances of joy on the distinctions she had won and another records a miracle she performed before the Buddha, with his consent.  The rest contain a conversation between Uppalavannā and Māra (a conversation, more or less identical with the foregoing, is recorded in S.i.131f), wherein she tells him that she has passed completely beyond his power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books give several episodes connected with Uppalavannā.  Once a young man named Ananda, who was her cousin and had been in love with her during her lay-life, hid himself in her hut in Andhavana and, in spite of her protestations, deprived her of her chastity.  It is said that he was swallowed up by the fires of Avīcī.  From that time onwards, nuns were forbidden to live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49f; the incident is referred to in Vin.iii.35).  It is said (E.g., DhA.iv.166f) that this incident gave rise to the question whether even arahants enjoyed the pleasures of love and wished to gratify their passions.  Why should they not? For they are not trees nor ant-hills, but living creatures with moist flesh.  The Buddha most emphatically declared that thoughts of lust never entered the hearts of the saints.  On another occasion, Uppalavannā came across, in Andhavana, some meat left behind, obviously for her, by some kind-hearted thief; having cooked the meat, she took it to the Buddha at Veluvana.  Finding him away on his alms-rounds, she left the meat with Udāyi, who was looking after the vihāra, to be given to the Buddha, but Udāyi insisted on Uppalavannā giving him her inner robe as a reward for his services (Vin.iii.208f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.211), the miracle which Uppalavannā volunteered to perform at the Gandamba-tree, was the assumption of the form of a cakkavatti, with a retinue extending for thirty-six leagues and the paying of homage to the Buddha, with all the cakkavatti's followers, in the presence of the multitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of a pupil of Uppalavannā, who followed the Buddha for seven years, learning the Vinaya (Vin.ii.261).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha declares that Khemā and Uppalavannā are the measure of his women disciples, and that the believing nun, if she would aspire perfectly, should aspire to be like them (A.i.88; ii.164; S.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara's time Uppalavannā saw a woman disciple who was declared to be the best of those possessed of supernormal power, and wished for herself a similar rank in the dispensation of a future Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king of Benares, and having done many good deeds, was born in heaven.  Later, she was born in the world of men and had to work for her own living.  One day she gave to a Pacceka Buddha, who had just risen from samādhi, a meal of fried rice in his bowl and covered it with a beautiful lotus; the meal had been prepared for herself.  The lotus she afterwards took back but again replaced it, asking the Pacceka Buddha's forgiveness.  She expressed a wish that she should beget as many sons as there were grains of rice in her gift, and that lotuses should spring up under her feet as she walked.  In her next birth she was born in a lotus.  An ascetic adopted her as his daughter, but when she grew up, the king of Benares, hearing of her beauty, asked the ascetic for her hand and made her his chief queen, under the name of Padumavatī.  The king's other wives were jealous of her beauty, and when the king was away, quelling a rising of the border tribes, they concealed in caskets the five hundred sons, chief of whom was the prince Mahāpaduma (q.v.), that were born to Padumavatī, and told the king that Padumavatī was a non-human and had given birth to a log of wood.  Padumavatī was sent away in disgrace, but later, through the instrumentality of Sakka, the trick was exposed, and Padumavatī regained all her former power and glory.  (Her temporary downfall was due to her having withdrawn her gift of a lotus to the Pacceka Buddha.) Later, when Mahāpaduma and his brothers became Pacceka Buddhas, Padumavatī died of a broken heart and was born in a village outside Rājagaha.  There some of the Pacceka Buddhas who had been her sons discovered her, and they all came to a meal at her house.  At the conclusion of the meal she offered them blue lotuses, and expressed the wish that her complexion should be like the matrix of the blue lotus.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This account is a summary of the Therīgāthā Commentary, pp.182ff; AA.i.188ff; but see also DhA.ii.48f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna account of the past lives of Uppakavanna differs from the above in several details (ii.551. But vv.1-15 quoted in the ThigA.  differ from those in the Apadāna, and agree with the ThigA.  account).  According to this account, in Padumuttara's time she was a Nāga maiden named Vimalā and was impressed by the iddhi-powers displayed by a nun, hence her wish for similar powers.  The Apadāna also mentions Uppalavannā's birth as the daughter of a banker of Benares, in the time of Vipassī.  She gave great alms to the Buddha and the monks and made offerings of lotuses.  She was the second daughter of Kikī and her name was Samannaguttā.  In her next birth she became the ravishing daughter of Tirītavaccha of Aritthapura.  In her last birth she became an arahant within a fortnight of her ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uppalavannā's name occurs several times in the Jātakas.  In the Kharādiya Jātaka (J.i.160) she was a deer, the sister of the Bodhisatta; in the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.164) she was the mother of Rāhula, then born as a stag.  She is identified with the old woman, the foster-mother of Ayyakālaka (J.i.196), with the queen Mudulakkhanā (J.i.306), the brahminee in the Sārambha (J.i.375), the courtesan in the Kurudhamma (J.ii.381), the brahmin's daughter (and sister of Rāhula) in the Dhonasākha (J.iii.168), Siridevī in the Sirikālakanni (J.iii.264), the goddess in the Bhisapuppha (J.iii.310), Manoja's sister in the Manoja (J.iii.324), the ascetic's daughter in the Kumbhakāra (J.iii.383), the deity in the Jāgarajā (J.iii.405), in the Sankha (J.iv.22), and in the Kiñchanda (J.v.11), the sister in the Bhisa (J.iv.314), Sutanā in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423), the younger sister in the Jayaddisa (J.v.36), Kundalinī in the Tesakuna (J.v.125), Ummadantī in the Ummadantī (J.v.227), Hiridevatā in the Sudhābhojana (J.v.412), the goddess of the parasol in the Mūgapakkha (J.vi.29), the ocean spirit in the Mahājanaka (J.vi.68), the goddess in the Sāma (J.vi.95), Selā in the Khandahāla (J.vi.157), Accimukhī in the Bhūridatta (J.vi.219), Bherī in the Mahā-ummagga (J.vi.478) and Kanhajinā in the Vessantara (J.vi.593).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Uppalavannā who ordained Anojā and her companions, by the express wish of the Buddha (AA.i.178).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uppalavannā.-One of the two daughters of Kassapa I.  of Ceylon, the other being Bodhī.  The king built a vihāra and called it by his own name together with those of his daughters.  Cv.xxxix.11; see also Cv.Trs.i.43, n.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upakkilesa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Preached at Pācīnavamsadāya to Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila.  It was at the time of the quarrel of the Kosambī monks; the Buddha, in search of quietness, goes to Bālakalonaka, preaches there to Bhagu and proceeds to Pācīnavamsadāya, where he tells his cousins how they should develop meditation, getting rid of all obstacles.  M.iii.152ff.  The verses of the sutta are also found in the Vinaya version (i.349ff).  Some of the verses are included in the Dhammapada (vv.328-30) and in the Khaggavisāna Butts of the Sutta Nipāta (vv.11, 12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Gold ore must be purified from all its dross before it can be used for making ornaments, etc.; similarly, the mind must be freed from its impurities - the five nīvaranas - before it can be used for acquiring the higher knowledge (A.iii.16-19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upakkilesa Sutta.-Four things prevent the sun and the moon from shining with their full brilliance - clouds, mist, smoke and dust and Rāhu.  Similarly four things diminish the holiness of ascetics and recluses - intoxicants, sex, money and wrong livelihood (A.ii.53f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttareyyadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In Padumuttara's time he was a learned brahmin of Hamsavatī.  One day, when going to bathe with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and gave him his upper garment (uttarīya).  The garment remained in the sky, forming a canopy over the Buddha and his monks.  As a result, for thirty thousand kappas, Uttareyyadāyaka was born in the deva-worlds, and fifty times he became king of the gods.  On thirty-six occasions he was king of men.  Everywhere he went a canopy of fine material appeared over him and he obtained all he wished for.  Ap.i.272-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upatissagāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upatissagāma.-A brahmin village near Rājagaha.  It was the birthplace of Sāriputta (ThagA.ii.93; DhA.i.73).  Its real name was Nālaka (q.v.), but it was called Upatissagāma, evidently because its chieftains belonged to the Upatissa clan.  It is probable that Sāriputta's father, who was head of the village (gāmasāmi), was also called Upatissa.  See SnA.i.326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upatissagāma (sometimes called Upatissanagara).-The settlement founded by Vijaya's chaplain, Upatissa, on the banks of the Gambhīra-nadī, about seven miles to the north of Anurādhapura (Mhv.vii.44; Mhv.Trs.58, n.4; Dpv.ix.36; x.5).  It was the seat of government till Anurādhapura became the capital (See, e.g., Mhv.viii.4; x.48).  Soon after Mahinda's arrival in Ceylon many young men joined the Order, and among them there were five hundred from Upatissagāma (Mhv.xvii.60).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uposathakkhandha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the discourses occurring in the Uposathakhandha.  It is quoted in the Atthasālinī as authority that might be used by any opponent to prove that an immoral act of speech also arises in the mind-door.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary proceeds to explain how this argument could be refuted (DhsA.92f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upasīva-mānava-pucchā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixth sutta of the Parāyanavagga.  It contains the questions asked of the Buddha by Upasīva and the answers thereto (Sn.vv.1069-76).  One of Upasīva's questions was as to how the floods (ogha) may be crossed.  We are told that he was an ākiñcaññāyatanalābhī.  SnA.ii.593f; see also Culla-Niddesa, p.101.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uparittha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha (M.iii.69; ApA.i.106).  In a previous life, when Anuruddha was born as Annabhāra, he offered alms to the Pacceka Buddha and made various wishes which were fulfilled in later births (DhA.i.113f).  Uparittha had spent seven days in meditation on Gandhamādana, and when he appeared before Annabhāra, the latter ran home to his wife, fetched the food which had been prepared for themselves and gave it to Uparittha.  Uparittha ate the meal seated on Annabhāra's garment, which was spread on the ground for him.  AA.i.105; Thag.910; ThagA.ii.66.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udakadāyikā Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In a previous birth she was a water-carrier and maintained her children on her wages.  Having nothing else to give, she regularly provided water in a bath for others.  As a result, she was born in heaven and was fifty times queen of the deva-king and twenty times queen of kings on earth.  She could produce rain at will, and her body knew neither heat nor dirt.  Ap.ii.521-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uruvelakappa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A township of the Mallas in the Malla country.  Once when the Buddha was staying there, Bhadragaka, the headman of the town, visited him, and the Buddha preached to him a sermon on the arising and the cessation of Ill (S.iv.327f).  It was perhaps on the same occasion that the Buddha was visited by the headman Rāsiya, and he seems to have talked to him on various topics connected with the doctrine (S.iv.330ff).  Record is also made of a sermon preached by the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and addressed to the monks regarding the importance of insight (ariyañāna) (S.iv.228f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was staying at Uruvelakappa, he informed Ananda that he wished to spend the day alone in the Mahāvana, and he went there and sat down at the foot of a tree.  Meanwhile the householder Tapassu arrived and told Ananda that be could not understand how young men in the prime of life found any attraction in renouncing the world.  Ananda took Tapassu to the Buddha, who set his doubts at rest.  (A.iv.438ff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uddaka-Rāmaputta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the teachers under whom Gotama, after leaving the world and before he became the Buddha, received instruction (J.i.66, 81).  Uddaka taught him the doctrine which had been realised and proclaimed by his father Rāma, which was the attainment of the state of "neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness" (corresponding to the fourth Jhāna).  When Gotama had mastered this, Uddaka made him more than his own equal by setting him over the whole company of his disciples as their teacher.  But Gotama, finding this doctrine unsatisfactory, abandoned it (M.i.165ff., 240ff.; DhA.i.70-1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha evidently had a high regard for Uddaka-Rāmaputta, for after the Enlightenment, when looking for someone to whom the Dhamma might be preached, and who was capable of realising its import at once, his thoughts turned to Uddaka, but Uddaka was already dead (Vin.i.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vassakāra Sutta of the Anguttara Nikāya (ii.180) it is mentioned that King Eleyya, together with his bodyguard, Yamaka, Moggalla and others, were followers of Rāmaputta and that they held him in great esteem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.83f) the Buddha says that Uddaka claimed to be "versed in lore and to have conquered everything, digging out the root of Ill," though he had no justification for such a claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, in the Pāsādika Sutta (D.iii.126-7), the Buddha tells Cunda that when Uddaka said "seeing, he seeth not," he had in mind a man who saw the blade of a sharpened razor but not its edge - a low, pagan thing to speak about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sanskrit books Uddaka-Rāmaputta is called Udraka.  Mtu.ii.119-20; Dvy.392; Lal.306f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttarāpatha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The northern division of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;.  Its boundaries are nowhere explicitly stated in Pāli literature.  It has been suggested (See Law, Early Geog.  of Bsm., pp.48ff) that Uttarāpatha was originally the name of a great trade-route, the northern high road which extended from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara,Gandhāra')"&gt;Gandhāra&lt;/a&gt;, and that it lent its name - as did the Dakkhināpatha - to the region through which it passed.  If this be so, the name would include practically the whole of Northern India, from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga,Anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; in the east to Gandhāra in the north-west, and from the Himālaya in the north to the Vindhyā in the south.  According to the brahmanical tradition, as recorded in the Kāvyamīmāmsā (p.93), the Uttarāpatha is to the west of Prithudaka (Pehoa, about fourteen miles west of Thāneswar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief divisions included in this territory are mentioned in the Pāli literature as Kasmīra-Gandhāra and Kamboja.  This region was famous from very early times for its horses and horse-dealers (See, e.g., Vin.iii.6; Sp.i.175), and horses were brought down for sale from there to such cities as Benares (J.ii.287).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uttarāpatha was Kamsabhoga, where, in the city of Asitañjana, King Mahākamsa reigned (J.iv.79).  The Divyāvadana (p.470) mentions another city, Utpalavatī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvastu (iii.303), Ukkala, the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tapassu,Tapassu')"&gt;Tapassu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhallika,Bhalluka')"&gt;Bhalluka&lt;/a&gt;, was in Uttarāpatha, as well as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;, the famous university (Mtu.ii.166).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was regular trade between Sāvatthi and Uttarāpatha (PvA.100).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anganika_bh,Anganika Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Anganika Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; had friends in Uttarāpatha (ThagA.i.339).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Sāvatthi.  One day the Buddha came to his house and he filled the Buddha's bowl with the food prepared for his own use.  Three days in succession the Buddha came, and Udaya, feeling annoyed, said to the Buddha: "A pertinacious and greedy man is the Samana Gotama that he comes again and again." The Buddha pointed out to him how, again and again, the furrow has to be sown to ensure a continuous supply of food, how over and over again the dairy-folk draw milk, and how again and again birth and death come to the slow-witted.  At the end of the sermon both Udaya and his household became followers of the Buddha.  S.i.173f; SA.i.199-200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin, pupil of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his turn came to question the Buddha, he asked him to explain emancipation through higher knowledge and the destruction of&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/avijjaa,avijjā')"&gt;avijjā&lt;/a&gt;.  Because Udaya had already attained to the fourth &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhāna')"&gt;jhāna&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha gave his explanation in the terms of jhāna.  At the end of the sermon Udaya realised the Truth.  Sn.1006, 1105-11; SnA.ii.599-600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Udaya (or Udayana).&lt;/b&gt;-A prince of Hamsavati.  It was to him and to Brahmadeva, that Tissa Buddha preached his first sermon in the Deer Park at Yasavati.  He later became one of the two chief disciples of Tissa Buddha.  Bu.xviii.21; J.i.40; BuA.189.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta born as king of Benares.  In his previous birth he had been a servant of Suciparivāra (q.v.).  On fast days it was the custom in Suciparivāra's house for everyone, even down to the cowherds, to observe the uposatha, but this servant, being new to the place, was not aware of this.  He went to work early in the morning and returned late in the evening.  When he discovered that all the others were keeping the fast he refused to touch any food and, as a result, died the same night.  Just before death he saw the king of Benares passing in procession with great splendour, and felt a desire for royalty.  He was therefore born as the son of the king of Benares and was named Udaya.  In due course he became king, and one day, having seen Addhamāsaka (q.v.) and learnt his story, he gave him half his kingdom.  Later, when Addhamāsaka confessed to him the evil idea that had passed through his mind of killing the king in order to gain the whole kingdom, Udaya, realising the wickedness of desire, renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.  When leaving the throne he uttered a stanza containing a riddle which was ultimately solved by Gangamāla (q.v.).  J.iii.444ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Udaya&lt;/b&gt;.-King of Ceylon, Udaya I.  (A.C.  792-797), also called Dappula.  He was the son of Mahinda II.  and his wife was the clever Senā.  He had several children, among them Devā, who was given in marriage to Mahinda, son of the Ādipāda Dāthāsiva of Rohana.  For details of his reign see Cv.xlix.1ff; also Cv.  Trs.i.126, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A brother of Sena I.  and his Ādipāda.  During the king's absence from the capital, he married Nālā, daughter of his maternal uncle, and took her to Pulatthinagara, but the king forgave him and later, when his elder brother Mahinda died, made him Mahādipāda, sending him as ruler of the Southern Province.  Soon after, however, Udaya fell ill and died (Cv.l.6, 8, 44, 45).  According to an inscription, he had a son who, under Kassapa IV., became Mahālekhaka.  See Cv.  Trs.i.138, n.3 and 142, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana in the time of Sena I.  Cv.l.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon, Udaya II.  (A.C.  885-896), a younger brother of Sena II.  and afterwards his yuvarāja (Cv.li.63, 90ff; Cv.Trs.i.156, n.4).  He succeeded Sena II.  and reigned eleven years.  During his reign the province of Rohana was brought once more under the rule of the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon, Udaya III.  (A.C.  934-937).  He was the son of Mahinda, a younger brother of Sena II., and his mother was Kittī or Kittā.  He was first yuvarāja of Dappula IV.  and later succeeded him as king.  Cv.liii.4, 13ff; Cv.Trs.i.172, n.5 and 174, n.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Udaya.-&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon, Udaya IV.  (A.C.  945-953).  He was a friend of Sena III.  (perhaps his younger brother, see Ep.  Zey.ii.59) and was his yuvarāja.  On Sena's death, Udaya succeeded him and reigned for eight years.  During his reign the Colas invaded Ceylon, but were repulsed (Cv.liii.28, 39ff; also Cv.Trs.i.177, n.2).  Among his religious activities was the erection of the Manipāsāda, which, however, he could not complete.  Cv.liv.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Younger brother and yuvarāja of Sena V.  In Sena's quarrel with his mother, Udaya took the side of the latter.  Cv.liv.58, 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Udaya&lt;/b&gt;.-Senāpati of Sena V.  He was appointed by the king while the real Senāpati was away in the border country.  When the latter heard of the appointment, he marched against the king and defeated his forces.  Sena was forced to come to terms with the Senāpati and banish Udaya from the country.  Cv.liv.61, 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Udaya.&lt;/b&gt;-See also Udāyī-bhadda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttaradesa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A province of Ceylon, probably to the north of Anurādhapura.  It was often occupied by the Tamils, and its chiefs refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Sinhalese kings.  Its people had to be subdued from time to time by the Sinhalese kings, in order to establish the peace of the land and the security of the throne (See, e.g., Cv.xliv.71; xlvii.3, 54; xlviii.83-4, 95, 112).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district formed a convenient landing-place for invaders coming to Ceylon from India, where they might complete their preparations (E.g., Cv.i.14).  It is sometimes called Uttararattha, E.g., Cv.ixx.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udayabhadda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, born as king of Benares.  He was so called ("Welcome") because he was born to his parents as a result of their prayers.  He had a step-sister, Udayabhaddā.  When his parents wished him to marry, he refused, but in the end, yielding to their entreaties, he made a woman's image in gold and desired them to find a wife who resembled it.  Udayabhaddā alone could rival the image, so she was wedded to Udayabhadda.  They lived together in chastity and, in due course, when Udayabhadda died, the princess became queen.  The king was born as Sakka, and honouring a promise he had made to the princess to return and announce to her the place of his birth, he visited her as soon as he remembered her, and, before revealing himself, tested her in various ways.  Being satisfied with her conduct, he instructed her and went away.  The princess, renouncing the kingdom, became a recluse.  Later she was born in Tāvatimsa as the Bodhisatta's handmaiden.  J.iv.104ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Udayabhadda.-See Udāyibhadda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usabhavatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Usabhavatī.-A city where, in the pleasaunce near by, Paduma Buddha spent a rainy season.  The citizens gave a special kathina-robe to his chief disciple, Sāla (BuA.148).  According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.173), Piyadassī Buddha preached his first sermon in the same pleasaunce, but the Buddhavamsa (xiv.119) gives its name as Ussāvana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Usabhavatī.-The city in which the Buddha Vessabhū died, at the Khemārāma.  BuA.209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upasena &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upasena Thera.-Maternal uncle of Vijitasena Thera and brother of Sena.  He was an elephant-trainer, and having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant.  He ordained Vijitasena (ThagA.i.424).  According to the Mahāvastu (iii.60ff), Sāriputta was converted to Buddhism not by Assaji, as recorded in the Pitakas, but by an Elder named Upasena, who is, perhaps, to be identified with the Upasena.  The Mahāvastu (iii.431f) also mentions an Upasena who was nephew to the Tebhātika Jatilas.  When the Tebhātikas accepted the Buddha as their teacher, they cast the garments, etc., which they had used as ascetics, into the Nerañjarā, on the banks of which was Upasena's hermitage.  When Upasena saw the robes, etc., he knew that something must have happened to his uncles.  He went at once to see them and, having heard the good tidings of their new-found bliss became a monk himself.  It is not stated whether this Upasena is identical with the Elder of the same name mentioned above as the teacher of Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upasena Vangantaputta.-He was born in.  Nālaka as the son of Rūpasārī, the brahminee, his father being Vanganta.  He was the younger brother of Sāriputta (UdA.266; DhA.ii.188).  When he came of age, he learnt the three Vedas, and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order.  When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha.  The Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure (Vin.i.59; Sp.i.194; J.ii.449), and Upasena, wishing to earn the Master's praise on account of the very cause of this rebuke, practised insight and became an arahant.  Thereafter he adopted various dhutangas and persuaded others to do likewise.  In a short time he had a large retinue, each member of which was charming in his way, and the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming (samantapāsādikānam) (A.i.24).  Buddhaghosa says that Upasena was famed as a very clever preacher (pathavighutthadhammakathika), and many joined him because of his eloquence.  AA.i.152; also Mil.360, where more details are given of how Upasena admitted monks into the Order and of the conditions imposed on them; for a slightly different version see Vin.iii.230ff; it is said there that after Upasena's visit, the Buddha allowed monks who practised dhutangas, to visit him even during his periods of retreat.  See also Sp.iii.685f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visited the Buddha when the Buddha had enjoined on himself a period of solitude for a fortnight; the monks had agreed that anyone who went to see the Buddha would be guilty of a pācittiya offence, but the Buddha, desiring to talk to him, asked one of Upasena's followers if he liked rag-robes.  "No, Sir, but I wear them out of regard for my teacher," was the reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Theragāthā are found several verses ascribed to Upasena as having been spoken by him in answer to a question by his saddhivihdrika, regarding what was to be done during the dissensions of the Kosambī monks (vv.  577-86; the first verse is quoted in the Milinda 371 and also the fifth 395).  The Milinda-pañha (pp.393, 394) contains several other verses attributed to Upasena similar in their trend of ideas and admonitions.  The Udāna states (p.45f; UdA.266ff) that once when he was taking his siesta he reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the guidance of the Buddha.  The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, while Upasena was sitting after his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbhāra, fanned by the gentle breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils overhanging the cave.  One fell on his shoulder and bit him, and the venom spread rapidly throughout his body; he called to Sāriputta and other monks who were near, and requested that he might be taken outside on a couch, there to die.  This was done, and his body "was scattered there and then like a handful of chaff." (S.iv.40f; SA.iii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upasena had been, in Padumuttara's day, a householder of Hamsavatī.  One day he heard the Buddha declare one of his monks to be the best of those who were altogether charming, and wished for a similar declaration regarding himself by some future Buddha.  Towards this end he did many deeds of piety (ThagA.i.525).  The Apadāna mentions that he gave a meal to Padumuttara and eight monks, and at the meal placed over the Buddha's head a parasol made of kanikdra-flowers.  As a result, he was thirty times king of the devas and twenty-one times cakkavatti.  (Ap.i.62).  The verses quoted from the Apadāna in the ThagA.  are slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upasena is given, together with Yasa Kākandakaputta, as an example of one who observed the Vinaya precepts thoroughly, without imposing any new rules or agreements.  DA.ii.525.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Vaka Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Upasena Thera.-Mentioned in the Gandhavamsa (61, 66; also Svd.1197) as the author of the Saddhammappajjotikā, the commentary on the Mahā Niddesa.  But see Upatissa (13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Upasena.-Son of Sujāta Buddha.  Bu.xiii.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ujuññā (Ujjuññā)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district and a town in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;.  Once when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying at the Deer Park in Kannakatthala in the neighbourhood of the city, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, who happened to be at Ujuññā on business, visited the Buddha.  On this occasion was preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kannakatthala_s,Kannakatthala Sutta')"&gt;Kannakatthala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.ii.125ff; MA.ii.757).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was here too that Nigantha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acela_kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; came to see the Buddha.  This visit is recorded in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapasiihanaada_s,Kassapa Sīhanāda Sutta')"&gt;Kassapa Sīhanāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uggata&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uggata.-See Ugga (4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uggata.-A khattiya of the city of Sumangala, father of Sujāta Buddha.  J.i.38; Bu.xiii.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uggata.-The Kālinga king who, with Bhīmaratha, king of Sañjayantī, and Atthaka, king of Hastināpura, sought the Bodhisatta Sarabhanga to learn from him where the kings Kalābu, Nālikira, Ajjuna and Dandakī had been born after the destruction of themselves and their kingdoms as a result of their ill-treatment of holy men.  J.v.135ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their story is given in the Sarabhanga Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast of the Jātaka (J.v.137) takes Uggata to be not the name of the Kālinga king but a descriptive epithet, and explains it by saying cando viya suriyo viya ca pākato paññāto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvastu (iii.364f), however, definitely mentions Ugga as the name of the king, in the same way as Bhīmaratha and Asthamaka (Atthaka), and gives the capitals of the two latter as Sañjayantī and Hastināpura respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Uggata.-King during the time of Sobhita Buddha.  He built a vihāra named Surinda at Sunandavatī and another named Dhammaganārāma at Mekhalā and dedicated them to the Buddha and the Order.  At the festival of dedication of the former one hundred crores became arahants and at that of the latter, ninety crores (Bu.vii.9f; BuA.139).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Uggata.-Twenty-nine kappas ago there were sixteen kings of the name of Uggata, all previous incarnations of the Thera Citakapūjaka.  Ap.i.151.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Uggata.-King of one thousand and fifty-one kappas ago; a previous life of Dhajadāyaka Thera.  Ap.i.109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Uggata.-Fourteen kappas ago there were four kings named Uggata, previous births of Parappasādaka (Ap.i.114) or Bhūta (ThagA.i.494) Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udakavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena's&lt;/a&gt; park at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt; on the river.  It was a favourite spot of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola,Pindola-Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Pindola-Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;, who often spent the day there.  On one occasion when he was there, Udena came with the women of the palace to the pleasaunce to enjoy himself.  When the king fell asleep the women wandered about the park and, seeing Pindola, they went up to him and he preached to them.  The king, on waking, was enraged to find the women absent and, on learning the cause, went to Pindola and questioned him.  Pindola, knowing that the king had no wish to learn, sat silent.  The king, in great anger, threatened to cast a net of red ants on the Elder, but before he could carry out his threat, Pindola vanished through the air (SnA.ii.514f; SA.iii.27f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udakapūjaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In a previous birth he saw Padumuttara Buddha journeying through the air and wished to offer him some water.  He, therefore, threw some water into the air, which the Buddha, out of compassion, stopped to receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five kappas ago Udakapūjaka became king three times under the name of Sahassarāja (Ap.i.142-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Kutivihāriya Thera.  ThagA.i.129.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttara-Vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another name for the Abhayagiri-Vihāra (q.v.).  The inhabitants of the Uttaravihāra seem to have kept a chronicle, in the same way as did the dwellers of the Mahā-Vihāra.  This is often referred to in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, as the Uttara-Vihāra-atthakathā and the Uttara-Vihāra-Mahāvamsa.  Judging from the quotations from this work given in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, the Uttara-Vihāra chronicle seems to have differed from the tradition of the Mahā-Vihāra more in detail than in general construction.  It is not possible to say whether it contained exegetical matter on the Pāli Canon besides matters of historical interest.  For a detailed account of the work see Geiger: The Dīpavamsa and the Mahāvamsa, pp.50ff; also my edition of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uppalavanna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The god to whom Sakka entrusted the guardianship of Lankā and its people.  He met Vijaya and his followers when they landed in Ceylon and sprinkled water on them and wound a sacred thread about their hands for protection (Mhv.vii.5).  The god is generally identified with Visnu, though there is evidence to show that, at least in later mythology, the two gods were distinct.  Somewhere about A.D.  790, a shrine was erected to Uppalavanna in Devanagara (modern Dondra) in South Ceylon.  This shrine was later plundered by the Portuguese.  King Vīrabāhu offered there a sacrifice of victory (Cv.lxxxiii.49; see also Cv.Trs.ii.152, n.3) and Parakkamabāhu II.  rebuilt the shrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ukkāsatika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety-four kappas ago he had seen the Pacceka Buddha Kosika, in Himavā, engaged in meditation, and for seven days he had one hundred torches kept lighted near the Buddha.  On the eighth day he gave alms to the Pacceka Buddha.  As a result he was born in Tusita, and from his body rays of light issued, spreading one hundred leagues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five kappas ago he reigned as king of Jambudīpa, with his capital in Sobhana, built by Vissakamma himself, entirely of gold.  Ap.ii.414-15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ummadantī Jātaka (No.  527)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ummadantii,Ummadantī')"&gt;Ummadantī&lt;/a&gt;.  The story was related in connection with a backsliding brother who, having seen a very beautiful woman as he was going his alms-rounds in Sāvatthi, gave himself up to despair and had to be led to the Buddha for admonition (J.v.209ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also found, with certain slight variations, in the Jātakamālā under the title of Ummādayantī Jātaka (No.xiii).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tale of a maiden who made all who saw her mad, and of the love-smitten monarch who preferred walking in the right path and even meeting death itself to indulging in passion, is found also in the Kathāsaritsāgara.  E.g., in the 15th, 23rd and 91&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;taranga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uggasena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uggasena.-King of Benares.  The Nāga king, Campeyya, was brought before him by a brahmin snake-charmer for a performance, but when the king learnt from the Naga's sister, Sumanā, what had happened, he caused the Nāga to be set free.  Later, Campeyya took him to the Nāga-world and shewed him every honour.  Uggasena's subjects were allowed to bring back from the Nāga-world whatever they desired (J.v.458ff; Mtu.ii.177ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in the Campeyya Jātaka (q.v.).  In the present age Uggasena became Sāriputta.  J.v.468.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uggasena.-Son of a banker of Rājagaha.  He fell in love with a very skilful acrobat, married her and followed her about with her troupe.  When he discovered that she despised him for his lack of skill as an acrobat, he learnt the art and became a clever tumbler.  The Buddha knew that Uggasena was ready for conversion and entering Rājagaha while Uggasena was displaying his skill before a large crowd of people, withdrew their attention from his skilful feats.  Seeing Uggasena's disappointment, the Buddha sent Moggallāna to ask him to continue his performance, and while Uggasena was displaying his skill by various tricks, the Buddha preached to him, and Uggasena became an arahant, even as he stood poised on the tip of a pole, and later became a monk.  His wife also left the world soon after and attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha they were husband and wife.  On their way to the shrine of the Buddha where they worked as labourers, they saw an Elder and gave him part of the food they had with them and expressed the desire that they should, one day, like him, realise the Truth.  The Elder, looking into the future, saw that their wish would be fulfilled and smiled.  The wife, seeing him smile, said to her husband that the Elder must be an actor, and the husband agreed.  Because of this remark they became actors in this life, but through their pious gift they attained arahantship.  DhA.iv.59-65; also ibid., 159.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uggasena.-King, husband of Queen Dinnā (q.v.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ugga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A banker in the time of Konāgamana Buddha; he was one of the Buddha's chief lay-supporters and built for him a residence, half a league in extent, on the site of the later Jetavana.  J.i.94; Bu.xxiv.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-The chief minister of Pasenadi, king of Kosala (AA.ii.697).  He once visited the Buddha and told him how he rivalled in power and wealth the setthi Migāra, grandson of Rohana.  He was worth one hundred thousand in gold alone, to say nothing of silver.  The Buddha tells him that all this wealth could easily be lost in various ways, not so the seven kinds of Ariyan wealth (saddhā, sīla, etc.).  A.iv.6-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-One of those that formed the retinue of the rājā Eleyya.  He was a follower of Uddaka-Rāmaputta, whom the king too held in veneration.  A.ii.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;.  Ugga (-Gahapati).-&lt;/b&gt; A householder of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthigama,Hatthigāma(ka)')"&gt;Hatthigāma(ka)&lt;/a&gt; of the Vajji country.  Among householders he was declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who waited on the Order (sanghupatthākānam) (A.i.26).  On his father's death he was appointed to the post of setthi.  Once when the Buddha went to Hatthigāma during a tour and was staying in the Nāgavanuyyāna there, Ugga came to the pleasance, with dancers, at the conclusion of a drinking-feast of seven days' duration.  At the sight of the Buddha he was seized with great shame and his intoxication vanished.  The Buddha preached to him and he became an anāgāmī.  Thereupon he dismissed his dancers and devoted himself to looking after members of the Sangha.  Devas visited him at night and told him of the attainments of various monks, suggesting that he should choose only the eminent ones as the recipients of his gifts.  But what he gave, he gave to all with equal delight (AA.i.214-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha once stated that Ugga was possessed of eight special and wonderful qualities.  One of the monks, hearing the Buddha's statement, went to Ugga and asked him what these qualities were.  Ugga replied that he was not aware of what the Buddha had in mind and proceeded to explain eight wonderful things that had happened to him, viz.: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) As soon as he saw the Buddha, his state of drunkenness vanished and he made obeisance to the Buddha, who talked to him on various topics, such as dāna, sīla, etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) When the Buddha saw that Ugga's mind was ready, he preached to him the Four Truths, which he understood and realised.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) He had had four young and beautiful wives; when he took the vow of celibacy, he made ample provision for them; for one of them he obtained the husband of her choice, because she so desired, and this he did with no tinge of jealousy.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) All his immense wealth he shared with men of good and lovely conduct.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(5) On whatever monk he waited, he did it with whole-heartedness; to the monk's preaching he listened earnestly; if the monk did not preach, Ugga himself taught him the doctrine.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(6) Devas told him of the different attainments of various monks, but he gave to all alike, without distinction.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(7) He felt no pride that he should hold converse with devas.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(8) He did not worry about death because the Buddha had assured him that he would never more return to this world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monk reports this conversation to the Buddha and the Buddha tells him that these were the very qualities he had in mind when praising Ugga (A.iv.212-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikāya (Vajjī Sutta&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt; S.iv.109f) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Ugga, at Hatthigāmaka.  He asked the Buddha why it was that some beings attained full freedom in this very life, while others did not.  Because of grasping, says the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ugga had been a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He once heard the Buddha preach and declare, at the end of his sermon, one of his lay disciples to be the best of those who waited on the Order.  He wished for himself a similar attainment and did many good deeds towards that end (AA.i.214).  v.l.  Uggata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A householder of Vesāli, declared by the Buddha to be the best of those who gave agreeable gifts (manāpadāyakānam).  (A.i.26; in SA.iii.26 he is wrongly described as aggo panītadāyakānam - the title of Mahānāma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His original name is not known.  He came to be called Ugga-setthi, because he was tall in body, lofty in morals and of striking personality.  The very first time he saw the Buddha, he became a sotāpanna and later an anāgāmī.  When he was old, the thought came to him one day, while he was alone, "I will give to the Buddha whatever I consider most attractive to myself and I have heard from him that such a giver obtains his wishes.  I wish the Buddha would come to my house now." The Buddha, reading his thoughts, appeared before his door with a following of monks.  He received them with great respect and, having given them a meal, announced to the Buddha his intention of providing him and the monks with whatever they found agreeable (AA.i.213-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While staying at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, the Buddha once declared to the monks that Ugga was possessed of eight marvellous qualities.  The rest of the story is very similar to that of Ugga of Hatthigāmaka, given above.  This Ugga states as the first wonderful thing which happened to him, the faith he found in the Buddha at their very first meeting; three and four are the same; the fifth is that whatever monk he waits on, he does it whole-heartedly; the sixth, that if the monk preaches he would listen with attention, if the monk does not preach, Ugga would teach to him the doctrine; the seventh is the same; the eighth that he has got rid of all the orambhāgiya-samyojanas mentioned by the Buddha.  The conversation is reported to the Buddha who agrees that Ugga does possess the qualities mentioned (A.iv.208-12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.109f) repeats under Ugga of Vesāli the same discussion with the Buddha as was given in connection with Ugga of Hatthigāma, regarding the reason why some beings do not attain complete freedom in this very life.  This is perhaps due to uncertainty on the part of the compilers as to which Ugga took part in the original discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sutta in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.49-51) gives a list of things of which Ugga himself was fond.  We are told that he offered these things to the Buddha.  The list includes rice-cakes made in the shape of Sāla-blossoms, the flesh of sucking pig and Kāsi robes.  These and other things were given not only to the Buddha, but, according to the Commentary (AA.ii.602), also to five hundred monks.  The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died soon after and was born among the Manomayadevā.  He visited the Buddha from the deva-world and stated that he had achieved his goal (of reaching arahantship).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is included in a list of householders who possessed six special qualities: unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan conduct, insight and liberation (A.iv.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His desire to become chief of those who give agreeable things was first conceived in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was a householder in Hamsavatī; he heard the Buddha describe one of his disciples as being a giver of such gifts (AA.i.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera.  He was the son of a banker in Ugga, in the Kosala country.  When the Buddha was staying in the Bhaddārāma there, Ugga heard him preach and entered the Order.  Soon afterwards he became an arahant (Thag.v.80; ThagA.i.174-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a householder in the time of Sikhī Buddha and offered him a ketaka-flower.  As a result, he was born twelve times as king.  He is probably to be identified with Sudassana Thera of the Apadāna (i.164-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ugga.  &lt;/b&gt; A banker of the city of Ugga; he was a friend of Anāthapindika and, according to some accounts, his son married Anāthapindika's daughter, Cūla Subhaddā.  He and his family had been followers of the Niganthas, but they later became followers of the Buddha through the intervention of Subhaddā.  For the story see Cūla Subhaddā.  See also Kālaka (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ugga.&lt;/b&gt;-A township (nigama) in Koala.  The Buddha stayed there at the Bhaddārāma (ThagA.i.74).  The town was the residence of the banker Ugga, and was once a stronghold of the Niganthas; after the conversion of Ugga's family, through Cūla Subhaddā's intervention, the people became faithful followers of the Buddha and for some time Anuruddha lived there, at the Buddha's special bidding, to preach to the new converts (DhA.iii.465-9; according to ThagA.i.65 Mahā Subhaddā also lived in Ugga, in a family of unbelievers).  Probably the Uggārāma, mentioned in the story of Anganika Bhāradvāja (ThagA.i.339; Brethren, 157, n.4), was also in Ugga, in which case it was near the village of Kundiya of the Kuru country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upavatta (Upavattana)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sāla-grove of the Mallas of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusināra')"&gt;Kusināra&lt;/a&gt;, on the further side of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hirannavati,Hiraññavatī')"&gt;Hiraññavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  This was the last resting-place of the Buddha on his last tour, and here he passed away, lying on a bed placed between two sāla trees (D.ii.137ff; Dpv.xv.70).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda,Subhadda')"&gt;Subhadda&lt;/a&gt; visited the Buddha in the earlier part of the last night of his life, was converted and gained admission into the Order, afterwards winning arahantship.  (See also DhA.iii.377).  It was here, too, that the Buddha asked the monks if they had any doubts they wished to hear solved regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, magga and patipadā, or any questions they wished to ask (A.ii.79), and here he gave his last admonition to the monks (S.i.157; see also Ud.37f).  Ananda tried to persuade him to die in a place of greater importance, and the Buddha, in order to disabuse his mind, preached to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s,Mahā Sudassana Sutta')"&gt;Mahā Sudassana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.169f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.572f) that the road to the sāla-grove from the Hiraññavatī led from the further bank of the river, like the road from the Kadambanadī to the Thūpārāma in Anurādhapura which led through the Rājamātu-vihāra.  The row of sāla-trees stretched from south to east and then continued to the north ("like the chief street in Anurādhapura").  Hence the name Upavattana.  The grove was to the southwest of Kusināra.  UdA.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uracchadā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the nine daughters of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii,King Kikī')"&gt;King Kikī&lt;/a&gt;.  She was born with the semblance of a necklet upon her neck and shoulders, as though drawn by a painter, hence her name, Uracchadā.  When sixteen years old she heard Kassapa Buddha preach, and became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;.  That same day she attained arahantship, entered the Order and passed into Nibbāna (J.vi.481).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī, both Uracchadā and Queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa,Māyā')"&gt;Māyā&lt;/a&gt; (mother of Gotama Buddha) were born as the daughters of King Bandhumā.  One day the king received a present of a golden wreath, worth a thousand, and a box of precious sandalwood.  He gave the sandalwood to the elder daughter and the wreath to the younger.  The two girls, wishing to present their gifts to the Buddha, obtained the king's consent.  The elder princess powdered the sandalwood and filled a golden box with it.  The younger had the wreath made into a necklet and placed it in a golden casket.  They then went to the Buddha, and the elder reverently sprinkled his body with sandalwood and scattered it in his cell with the prayer, "May I, in time to come, be the mother of a Buddha like you." The younger reverently placed the necklet on the Buddha and prayed, "Until I attain arahantship, may this ornament never part from my body." (J.vi.481)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Vimānavatthu Commentary (pp.  270f), Uracchadā's name was Uracchadamālā and her teacher was a brahmin named Gopāla, who was also present when the Buddha preached to Uracchadamālā.  But he did not acquire any special attainments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upacāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Upacālā and nephew of Sāriputta and Khadiravaniya-Revata.  He was ordained by Revata (Thag.v, 43; ThagA.i.110).  He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya (v.133) in a list of very eminent disciples, together with Cāla, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata and Katissaha.  They lived in the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, but when the Licchavis went there to visit the Buddha, they moved to the Gosingasālavana in search of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uggaha Mendakanattā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grandson of the banker &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka,Mendaka')"&gt;Mendaka&lt;/a&gt;; he lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya,Bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt;.  Once when the Buddha was staying in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana,Jātiyāvana')"&gt;Jātiyāvana&lt;/a&gt; at Bhaddiya, Uggaha invited him and three monks to a meal at his house.  At the conclusion of the meal, he asked the Buddha to speak a few words of advice to his daughters who were about to be married.  The Buddha preached to them the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uggaha_s,Uggaha Sutta')"&gt;Uggaha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.36ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that their nuptials were already in progress at the time of the Buddha's visit (AA.ii.597).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttarī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nun.  She continued going on her rounds for alms until she reached the age of one hundred and twenty.  One day, when returning from her round, she met a monk in the street and gave him all she had in her bowl.  On the second and third days she did likewise.  On the fourth day, as she was going her round, she met the Buddha in a very crowded spot.  She stepped back and, while doing so, she trod on the skirt of her robe which had slipped down.  Unable to keep her feet, she fell down.  The Buddha came up and spoke to her.  She became a Sotāpanna.  DhA.iii.110-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udumbarikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A queen (devī) who built the Udumbarikā Paribbājakārāma near Rājagaha (D.iii.36; DA.iii.832).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close to the ārāma was the lotus-pond Sumāgadhā and a feeding ground for peacocks (Moranivāpa) (D.iii.39).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was here that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s,Udumbarikā Sīhanāda Sutta')"&gt;Udumbarikā Sīhanāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uttara Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uttara Sutta.-The conversation between Uttara devaputta (Uttara 3) and the Buddha.  One's life is short, says the devaputta; one should, therefore, gather merit, in order to gain bliss.  Rather, answers the Buddha, reject the bait of all the worlds and aspire after final Peace (S.i.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uttara Sutta.-Preached to the monks by Uttara Thera (Uttara 6) at Mount Sankheyya at Dhavajālikā in Mahisavatthu.  From time to time we should reflect on our own misfortunes as well as on those of others, and likewise on our successes.  Vessavana heard this sutta being preached as he was journeying from north to south on some business.  He went to Tāvatimsa, where he informed Sakka of what he had heard Uttara say.  Sakka, thereupon, appeared before Uttara and asked him whether his sermon was based on his own illumination (patibhāna), or on what he had heard from the Buddha.  Uttara's reply was that his words were garnered from the Doctrine of the Buddha just as a man takes a handful of grain from a heap of grain.  Sakka then repeated the whole sermon on the same subject, which be had heard the Buddha preach to the monks at Gijjhakūta in Rājagaha.  A.iv.162-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Udena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;.  He was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parantapa,Parantapa')"&gt;Parantapa&lt;/a&gt;.  His mother, when pregnant with him, was carried off by a monster-bird and deposited on a tree near the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/allakappa,Allakappa')"&gt;Allakappa&lt;/a&gt;.  The child was born in a storm (utu?) - hence the name.  Allakappa, having discovered the mother and child, took them under his protection.  One day, when Udena was grown up, Allakappa saw by the conjunction of the planets that Parantapa had died.  When he announced the news, Udena's mother revealed to him her identity.  Allakappa taught Udena the various charms he knew for taming elephants and sent him to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;, with a large following of elephants, to claim the kingdom.  Some time after he became king, Udena appointed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi,Ghosaka')"&gt;Ghosaka&lt;/a&gt; as his treasurer, and one day, having seen Ghosaka's adopted daughter, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Sāmāvatī')"&gt;Sāmāvatī&lt;/a&gt;, going to the river to bathe, sent for her and married her.  Later he married, in very romantic circumstances, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasuladattaa,Vāsuladattā')"&gt;Vāsuladattā&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota,Canda Pajjota')"&gt;Canda Pajjota&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;.  The Dhammapadatthakathā (i.161ff) contains a whole story-cycle of Udena from which these details, except where otherwise stated, are taken.  For details of other persons mentioned in the article and their encounters with Udena, see under their respective names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena had another wife, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiyaa,Māgandiyā')"&gt;Māgandiyā&lt;/a&gt;, who took advantage of her new position to wreak vengeance on the Buddha for having once slighted her.  When Sāmāvatī was converted to the Buddha's faith by her handmaiden &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khujjuttaraa,Khujjuttarā')"&gt;Khujjuttarā&lt;/a&gt;, Māgandiyā tried to poison the king's mind against her, but the attempt was frustrated, though Sāmāvatī very nearly lost her life at the king's hand.  When Udena realised how grievously he had wronged her, he promised to grant her a boon, and, as the result of her choice, the Buddha sent &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; with five hundred monks to the palace every day, to preach to the women of the court.  Udena himself does not seem to have been interested in religion.  Once when be discovered that the women of the court had given five hundred costly robes to Ananda, he was annoyed, but when in answer to his questions Ananda explained to him that nothing given to members of the Order was wasted, he was pleased and himself made a similar offering of robes to Ananda.  Mentioned also in Vin.ii.291. The incident took place after the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His encounter in his park the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udakavana,Udakavana')"&gt;Udakavana&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola,Pindola Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Pindola Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;, in somewhat similar circumstances, did not, however, end so happily.  Udena's women had given Pindola their robes, and when the king questioned Pindola as to the appropriateness of the gift, he remained silent.  Udena threatened to have him bitten by red ants; but Pindola vanished through the air.  (SnA.ii.514-5; SA.iii.27; in a previous birth too, as Mandavya, Udena had been guilty of abusing holy men, see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatanga_jat_497,Mātanga Jātaka')"&gt;Mātanga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, J.iv.375ff).  Later (S.iv.110f) we find him visiting Pindola again on friendly terms and receiving information as to how young members of the Order succeeded in curbing their passions in spite of their youth.  In this context Udena calls himself a follower of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena had a son named Bodhi (J.iii.157), among whose activities the building of a palace, called Kokanada, is specially recorded.  It is clear from the incident of the presentation of robes to Ananda, referred to above, as well as by a definite statement to that effect contained in the Petavatthu Commentary (p.140), that Udena survived the Buddha; but whether his son Bodhi succeeded him or not is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Udena's possessions mention is made of his bow, requiring one thousand men to string it (DhA.i.216), and of his elephant Bhaddavatikā (J.iv.384).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena is sometimes referred to as Vamsarājā (king of the Vamsas) (E.g., J.iv.375; the Dvy.  e.g., 528, calls him Vatsarājā), the Vamsas or the Vacchas being the inhabitants of Kosambī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Udāna Commentary (p.382) he is called Vajjirājā.  The Milinda-pañha (p.291) tells a story of a woman called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaalamaataa,Gopāla-mātā')"&gt;Gopāla-mātā&lt;/a&gt;, who became a queen of Udena.  She was the daughter of peasant-folk, and, being poor, she sold her hair for eight pennies, with which she gave a meal to Mahā Kaccāna and his seven companions.  That very day she became Udena's queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera.  He once stayed, after the Buddha's death, in the Khemiyambavana near Benares.  There the brahmin Ghotamukha visited him.  Their conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghotamukha_s,Ghotamukha Sutta')"&gt;Ghotamukha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  At the end of Udena's sermon, the brahmin offered to share with him the daily allowance he received from the Anga king.  This offer was refused, and at Udena's suggestion Ghotamukha built an assembly-hall for monks at Pātaliputta; this assembly-hall was named after him (M.ii.157ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Udena (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-An upāsaka of Kosala.  He built a vihāra for the Order, and he invited monks for its dedication, which took place during the Vassa.  It being against the rules to go on a journey before the Vassa, the monks asked him to postpone the dedication.  This annoyed him.  When the matter was referred to the Buddha, he altered the rule so that a journey lasting not more than seven days could be undertaken during the Vassa.  Vin.i.139.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Udena Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-The personal attendant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.  Bu.v.24; J.i.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king.  He joined the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kondanna,Kondañña')"&gt;Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, with ninety crores of followers, all of whom became arahants.  BuA.111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A yakkha.  See Udena Cetiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king, father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siddhattha,Siddhattha')"&gt;Siddhattha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha (Bu.xvii.13); also called Jayasena (BuA.187).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Udena.&lt;/b&gt;-A king, a former birth of Ukkhepakata-vaccha Thera (ThagA.i.148), called in the Apadāna (i.56), Ekatthambhika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Udena Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant, probably identical with Udena (2).  During the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a hermit, with eighty-four thousand others, living in a hermitage near Paduma-pabbata in the Himālaya.  Having heard the Buddha's praises from a yakkha, he visited Padumuttara, offered him a lotus flower and spoke verses in praise of him.  Ap.ii.362ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Upāsikā Vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nunnery in Anurādhapura, built by Devānampiyatissa, for the accommodation of Anulā and her followers, pending the arrival of Sanghamittā (Mhv.xviii.12).  Later, Sanghamittā took up her residence there and it was enlarged by the addition of twelve buildings, three of which gained peculiar sanctity because in these were set up the mast, the rudder and the helm of the ship that had brought the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon, and these buildings were called, respectively, the Kupayatthithapita-ghara, the Piyathapita-ghara and the Arittathapita-ghara.  Even when other sects arose, these twelve buildings were occupied by the Hatthālhaka (or orthodox) nuns.  Mhv.xix.68ff; the Tikā (p.408) says the houses were originally called Cūlaganā-gāra, Mahāganāgāra and Sirivaddhāgāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uposatha Suttā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Uposatha Suttā.-Suttas dealing with questions asked by monks of the Buddha as to why certain Nāgas (egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born and born without parents) should keep the fast day, divesting themselves of their Nāga forms! The Buddha replies that they do so because they wish to be born in happy states.  S.iii.241f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Uposatha Sutta.-One Uposatha-day, the Buddha, surrounded by the company of monks, was seated in the Migāramātu-pāsāda, in Sāvatthi.  Looking round and finding them seated in silence, he spoke their praises, saying how some of them had won access to the devas, some to Brahma, others to the Imperturbable (ānejja), and yet others to the Ariyan state.  A.ii.183f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Uposatha Sutta.-One uposatha-night, during the first watch, Ananda approaches the Buddha and asks him to recite the Pātimokkha.  Three times he asks, but the Buddha remains silent, and at last says that the assembly is impure.  Mahāmoggallāna, who is present, looks round, and seeing there a monk given up to wicked ways, asks him to leave.  On his refusing to do so, Moggallāna takes him by the hand and leads him away.  Thereupon the Buddha proceeds to explain how, just as the sea is full of eight kinds of marvels, so is the Dhamma.  A.iv.204ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Uposatha (v.l.  Uposathanga) Sutta.-Visākhā, having taken the uposatha vows, visits the Buddha at noontide in the Migāramātu-pāsāda.  The Buddha explains to her that there are various ways of observing the sabbath; these he describes as the herdsman's sabbath, the sabbath of the naked ascetics and the sabbath of the Ariyans.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Uruvelā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Uruvelā.&lt;/b&gt;-A locality on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/neranjara,Nerañjarā')"&gt;Nerañjarā&lt;/a&gt;, in the neighbourhood of the Bodhi-tree at Buddhagayā.  Here, after leaving &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalara_kaalaama,Alāra')"&gt;Alāra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uddaka_raamaputta,Uddaka')"&gt;Uddaka&lt;/a&gt;, the Bodhisatta practised during six years the most severe penances.  His companions were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya,Pañcavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt;-monks, who, however, left him when he relaxed the severity of his austerities (M.i.166).  The place chosen by the Bodhisatta for his penances was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/senaaniinigama,Senā-nigama')"&gt;Senā-nigama&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka version (J.i.67f) contains additional particulars.  It relates that once the Bodhisatta fainted under his austerities, and the news was conveyed to his father that he was dead.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt;, however, refused to believe this, remembering the prophecy of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaladevala,Kāladevala')"&gt;Kāladevala&lt;/a&gt;.  When the Bodhisatta decided to take ordinary food again, it was given to him by a girl, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa,Sujātā')"&gt;Sujātā&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s6_siy,Senānī')"&gt;Senānī&lt;/a&gt; of the township of Senānī.  In the neighbourhood of Uruvelā were also the Ajapāla Banyan-tree, the Mucalinda-tree and the Rājāyatana-tree, where the Buddha spent some time after his Enlightenment, and where various shrines, such as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/animisa_cetiya,Animisa-cetiya')"&gt;Animisa-cetiya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratanacankama_cetiya,Ratanacankama-cetiya')"&gt;Ratanacankama-cetiya&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/ratanaghara_cetiya,Ratanaghara')"&gt;Ratanaghara&lt;/a&gt; later came into existence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Uruvela the Buddha went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;, but after, he had made sixty-one arahants and sent them out on tour to preach the Doctrine, he returned to Uruvelā, to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappaasika,Kappāsikavanasanda')"&gt;Kappāsikavanasanda&lt;/a&gt; and converted the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavaggiya,Bhaddavaggiyā')"&gt;Bhaddavaggiyā&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.23f; DhA.i.72).  At Uruvelā dwelt also the Tebhātika-Jatilas: &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela-Kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nadi_kassapa,Nadī-Kassapa')"&gt;Nadī-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa_kassapa,Gayā-Kassapa')"&gt;Gayā-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, who all became followers of the Buddha (Vin.i.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (E.g., Mhv.i.17ff; Dpv.i.35, 38, 81), it was while spending the rainy season at Uruvelā, waiting for the time when the Kassapa brothers should be ripe for conversion, that the Buddha, on the full-moon day of Phussa, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, paid his first visit to Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of several temptations of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvela, apart from the supreme contest with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt;, under the Bodhi-tree.  Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him.  On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly.  Another time Māra tried to fill the Buddha's mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment (S.i.103ff).  Seven years after the Buddha's Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away discomfited, that Mars's three daughters, Tanhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose (S.i.124f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Uruvelā, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices.  The Brahmā &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati,Sahampatī')"&gt;Sahampatī&lt;/a&gt; thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence (S.i.136ff; Vin.i.4f).  It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha's mind that the sole method of winning Nibbāna was to cultivate the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthānas')"&gt;satipatthānas&lt;/a&gt; and that Sahampatī visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view (S.v.167; and again, 185).  A different version occurs elsewhere (S.v.232), where the thought which arose in the Buddha's mind referred to the five controlling faculties (saddhindriya, etc.), and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name Uruvela is explained as meaning a great sandbank (mahā velā, mahanto vālikarāsi).  A story is told which furnishes an alternative explanation: Before the Buddha's appearance in the world, ten thousand ascetics lived in this locality, and they decided among themselves that if any evil thought arose in the mind of any one of them, he should carry a basket of sand to a certain spot.  The sand so collected eventually formed a great bank (AA.ii.476; UdA.26; MA.i.376; MT.84).  In the Divyāvadāna (p.202), the place is called Uruvilvā.  The Mahāvastu (ii.207) mentions four villages as being in Uruvelā: Praskandaka, Balākalpa, Ujjangala and Jangala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Uruvelā.&lt;/b&gt;-A township in Ceylon, founded by one of the ministers of Vijaya (Dpv.ix.35; Mhv.vii.45).  According to a different tradition (Mhv.ix.9; perhaps this refers to another settlement), it was founded by a brother of Bhaddakacānā, called Uruvela.  Uruvelā was evidently a port as well, because we are told that when Dutthagāmanī decided to build the Mahā-Thūpa, six wagonloads of pearls as large as myrobalan fruit, mixed with coral, appeared on dry land at the Uruvela-pattana (Mhv.xxviii.36).  Near Uruvelā was the Vallī-vihāra, built by Subha (Mhv.xxxv.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geiger thinks (Mhv.Trs.189, n.2) that Uruvelā was near the mouth of the modern Kalā Oya, five yojanas - i.e.  about forty miles - to the west of Anurādhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Uruvelā.&lt;/b&gt;-A village to which Queen Sugalā (q.v.) fled, taking the sacred relies, the Alms Bowl and the Tooth Relic (Cv.lxxiv.88).  It is identified with Etimole about five or six miles south-east of Monorāgala (Cv.Trs.ii.29, n.4).  It is perhaps to be identified with Uruvelamandapa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
