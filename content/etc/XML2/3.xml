  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ādicca&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another name for Suriya, the Sun (D.iii.196).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains the name as meaning Aditi's son (Aditiyā putto).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ādicca was also the gotta name of the Sākyans who were called the Ādiccā (Sn.v.423).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (VibhA.466) gives it as a gotta-name of the Khattiyas, together with Kondañña-gotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also below, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aadiccabandhu,Ādiccabandhu')"&gt;Ādiccabandhu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ānandā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five daughters of the chief queen of the king of the third &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka,Okkāka')"&gt;Okkāka&lt;/a&gt; dynasty (DA.i.258: SnA.i.352).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.84) says that Okkāka was the youngest of the sixteen kings of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasammata,Mahāsammata')"&gt;Mahāsammata&lt;/a&gt; dynasty and makes no mention of three Okkāka dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of Okkāka's chief queen was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthaa,Hatthā')"&gt;Hatthā&lt;/a&gt; (v.l.  Bhattā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āyupāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera who lived in the Sankheyya Parivena near Sāgala.  King Milinda's royal astrologer informed the Elder that the king wished to see him, and the king, having obtained his permission, visited him at the Parivena, attended by five hundred Yonakas.  The king discussed with the Elder the aim of those who became monks, and Āyupala was unable to meet the king's arguments.  Mil.19f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ānanda-bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;.  Ānanda discourses to the assembled monks on the nature of the True Saint- (Bhaddekaratta).  The Buddha appears on the scene and on being told of Ānanda's discourse, asks him how exactly he had proceeded.  Ānanda repeats to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddekaratta_s,Bhaddekaratta Sutta')"&gt;Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, which he had previously learnt from the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha recites it himself from beginning to end and praises Ānanda for his skill.  M.iii.189-91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ādiccabandhu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ādiccabandhu&lt;/b&gt;.-An often-used epithet of the Buddha (E.g., D.iii.197; Sn.v.1128; Thag.  26, 158, 417, etc.).  The Vimanavatthu Commentary (p.116) says that Ādicca (the Sun) belonged to the Gotamagotta, as did also the Buddha, hence his epithet Ādiccabandhu; other explanations are given in the same context: the Buddha is born in the same ariyā jāti and is the descendant of the Sun (tam paticca tassa ariyāya jātiya jātattā), or the Sun is the Buddha's kinsman because the Sun is the Buddha's orasaputta (breast-born son) inasmuch as the Sun is the Buddha's disciple.  It is in this sense that in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.57) the Buddha speaks of the sun as "mama pajā," which Buddhaghosa (SA.i.86) explains as meaning disciple and spiritual son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ādicca is described as tapatam mukham (chief of heat-producing things).  MA.ii.783.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ādiccabandhu&lt;/b&gt;.-A Pacceka Buddha who was instrumental in enabling the author (son of the King of Benares) of the twentieth verse of the Khaggavisāna Sutta to become a Pacceka Buddha.  Ādiccabandhu saw that the young prince, who had renounced the world and was living in his father's park near the city, did not, on account of the visits of his parents and others, have sufficient peace of mind to develop his power of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, therefore, visited the prince and persuaded him to go into the forest by showing him how real pabbajitas lived.  The first two lines of the Sutta Nipāta verse (No.  54) were uttered by Ādiccabandhu.  Sn.v.54; SnA.i.104-5; see also ApA.i.105, 152.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ātumā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town that lay between Kusinārā and Sāvatthi.  Once the Buddha, with a large company of bhikkhus, visited the town.  At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life (a buddhapabbajita, identified by Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.599) with the buddhapabbajita Subhadda) and had formerly been a barber.  He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber's art.  When the monk heard of the Buddha's coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal.  The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him.  The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a dukkata offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber's equipment (Vin.i.249-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.131-2) the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā.  There was a thunderstorm and two peasants (brothers) and four oxen were struck by lightning.  A large number of people having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of the accident.  But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it.  Such was the state of calm of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āsanka Jātaka (No.  380)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic in the Himālaya.  At that time a being of great merit left Tāvatimsa and was born as a girl in the midst of a lotus in a pool near the Bodhisatta's hermitage.  The Bodhisatta, noticing some peculiarity in the growth of the lotus, swam to it and recovered the girl, whom he brought up as his daughter, giving her the name of Āsankā.  Sakka, coming to visit him, saw the girl, and, inquiring what he could do for her comfort, he provided her with a crystal palace and divine food and raiment.  She spent her time waiting on the Bodhisatta.  The King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, having heard of her great beauty, came to the forest with a large following and asked for her hand.  The Bodhisatta agreed, on condition that the king would tell him her name.  The king spent a whole year trying to guess it and, having failed, was returning home in despair, when the girl, looking out of her window, told him of the creeper Āsāvatī, for whose fruits gods wait for one thousand years.  She thus encouraged him to try again.  Another year passed and she again raised hopes in the disappointed king by relating to him the story of a crane whose hopes Sakka had fulfilled.  At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, and in the course of their talk the girl's name was mentioned.  When the king was told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and told it to him.  The Bodhisatta then gave Āsankā in marriage to the king (J.iii.248-54).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ādāsamukha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as the King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He was the son of Janasandha (also called Dasaratha), and because his face was resplendent with beauty like a well-polished golden mirror, he was called Ādāsamukha.  His father died when he was seven years old, and the courtiers tested the boy in various ways before crowning him king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of his wisdom soon spread abroad and once, when an old servant of his father's (Gāmani Canda) was being brought to the court to answer various charges, fourteen problems were entrusted to him by different inhabitants of the kingdom to be placed before the king for solution.  The king solved them all and ruled righteously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gaamani_jat_257,Gāmani Canda Jātaka')"&gt;Gāmani Canda Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ājañña Jātaka (No.  24)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Brahmadatta was ruling in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, seven kings laid siege to the city.  A warrior sent by Brahmadatta harnessed two horses (brothers) and, sallying forth from the city, overcame six camps and captured six kings.  Just then the elder horse (who was the Bodhisatta) was wounded.  The charioteer unfastened the horse's armour as he lay on his side, and started to arm another horse.  The Bodhisatta addressed the charioteer and said that as an Ājañña horse he must fight on.  The charioteer set him on his feet again and, with his help, captured the seventh camp and its king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, having counselled the victorious king to show mercy to his captives, died, and his body was burnt with all honours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk who had given up striving.  J.i.181-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ālambara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drum of the Asuras made from the claw of the crab of Kulīradaha.  (For the story see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aanaka,Ānaka')"&gt;Ānaka&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asuras')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt; were defeated in battle they left the drum in their flight and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; took possession of it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its sound resembled a peal of thunder and for that reason, probably, came to be called Ālambara-megha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āsīvisa Sutta/Vagga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Āsīvisa Sutta.-Preached at Sāvatthi.  Man has to tend four snakes of fierce heat and fearful venom - the four mahābhūtas; be is constantly followed by five murderous foes - the five upādānakkhandhā; he is pursued by a murderous housebreaker with uplifted sword - passionate desire (nandirāga); while trying to escape them, he wanders into an empty village, where everything is empty - the sixfold personal sense sphere (ajjhattikāyatana), and into it come village-plunderers - the six fold external sense-spheres (bāhirāyatana.) Fleeing from there he comes to a broad sheet of water beset with danger on the hither side; the further side is secure from fear, but there is no boat and no bridge - the fivefold flood (ogha), the hither shore being sakkāya and the further shore nibbāna.  S.iv.172-b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Āsīvisa Sutta.-There are four kinds of snakes in the world: the venomous but not fierce, the fierce but not venomous, the one that is both and the one that is neither.  Similarly there are four kinds of persons: the one quick to get angry but with short-lived anger, the one slow to get angry but with lasting anger, etc.  (A.ii.110-11)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Āsīvisa Vagga.-The nineteenth chapter of the Salāyatana Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikāya.  J.iv.172-204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ānandakumāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shipwright, who, with three hundred others, was sent by Mahosadha to the Upper Ganges to secure timber wherewith to build three hundred ships in preparation for Mahosadha's visit to the capital of Pañcala in order to erect buildings for King Vedeha.  A.vi.427.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ācāmadāyikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family in Rājagaha was afflicted with plague and all its members died except one woman.  She broke through a wall (that being the customary method of avoiding infection) and went and lived in the backyard of another house.  The inmates of the house, having compassion on her, gave her the remnants of their food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Mahā Kassapa, rising after seven days and nights from nirodha-samāpatti, knowing that he could be of use to the poor woman, appeared before her asking for alms.  Having nothing but rice-water to give him, she asked him to go elsewhere, but the Elder showed his desire to accept her gift and refused alms offered to him by Sakka and by the inmates of the house behind which the woman lived.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With great joy she gave him the rice-water, and the Elder then told her that three births earlier she had been his mother.  That same night she died and was born in a vimāna among the Nimmānaratī gods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her story forms the basis of the Ācāma-dāyikā-Vimāna Vatthu.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ābha Vagga&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifteenth chapter of the Catukka Nipāta of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anguttara_nikaya,Anguttara Nikāya')"&gt;Anguttara Nikāya&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It consists of ten suttas on such subjects as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four splendours, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four due seasons, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four sins and virtues of speech and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four choicest parts (sāras).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.ii.139-41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āsava Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Āsava Sutta.-On the six qualities which make a monk worthy of honour and offerings, due to destruction of the āsavas, and also on the methods which lead to such destruction.  A.iii.387-94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Āsava Sutta.-Ten things that conduce to the destruction of the āsavas: the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path, in addition to sammāñāna and sammāvimutti.  A.v.237.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āyu Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Āyu Sutta.-Preached at the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha.  The Buddha tells the monks that human life is very brief and has its sequel elsewhere.  Therefore good must be done and the holy life must be lived.  Mars approaches the Buddha and suggests that men should take no heed of death, but should enjoy life like a babe replete with milk.  The Buddha points out to him the error of such a view (S.i.108).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Āyu Sutta.-Preached at the same place, on another occasion.  Māra utters the same sentiment and the Buddha refutes his views.  Māra retires vanquished.  S.i.108-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āraññaka Mahā-abhaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk.  For twelve years a devotee gave him his requisites including cloth for his robes; but a thief, Harantika, always stole the cloth.  Discovering this, the devotee caught the rogue, beat him soundly, and, having tied him to a corpse, warned the villagers that a Yakkha would be prowling about that night, calling himself Harantika.  The villagers fastened their doors and gave him no admission, even his wife refusing to recognise his voice.  Then Harantika went to Mahāabhaya, and having confessed his guilt, asked for protection.  Mahāabhaya bathed him in warm water and rubbed oil on his body, saying it was not his business to take revenge.  Harantika later became a monk and attained arahantship.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ālamba&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ālamba.&lt;/b&gt;-Probably the name of a divine musician, one of a large number who wait on Sakka and on his wives (Vv., pp.16, 47).  Dhammapāla (VvA.96) quotes this view and objects to it, saying that the name is not that of a musician but of a musical instrument.  The opinion that the name denotes a celestial musician seems, however, to be the right one.  For a discussion see Hardy: Vimānavatthu Commentary (P.T.S.  Ed.), 372-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āyasmanta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general of King Sāhasamalla.  Āyasmanta deposed the king and installed Kalyānavatī, chief queen of Kittinissanka, on the throne of Ceylon.  It was he who really administered the government, the queen's power being only nominal.  The Cūlavamsa calls him a man of almost unsurpassable courage, a descendant of the Khandhāvara family.  He slew the Adhikārin Deva and had a vihāra erected at Valliggāma.  He also built a parivena called after him Sarājakulavaddhana (this evidently being one of his honorific titles) and gave land and other possessions for its maintenance.  He had a text-book of law compiled for the use of administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was slain by the Mahādipāda Anīkanga.  Cv.lxxx.33-44.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āvenika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are five special (āvenika) woes which a woman has to undergo as distinct from a man: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;at a tender age she goes to her husband's family, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;leaving her relations; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;she is subject to menses; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;to pregnancy; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;to labour at child-birth; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and she has to wait upon a man.

Ākankheyya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-The sixth sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, preached at Jetavana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk must conform to the sīla, the pātimokha and the sikkhāpadas, whatever be his yearnings, whether to be beloved of his fellows, to be given robes etc., to gain the four jhānas, to make an end of dukkha or to be possessed of such powers as dibbacakkhu, etc.  (M.i.33-6) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is often mentioned (E.g., DA.i.50; MA.i.13) as an example of a discourse preached by the Buddha of his own accord (attano ajjhāsayen'eva).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ākankkheyya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached to the monks at Jetavana on the ambitions that should stir a monk's heart.  A.v.131-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ānandabodhi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodhi-tree planted by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ānanda')"&gt;Ānanda&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika,Anāthapindika')"&gt;Anāthapindika&lt;/a&gt;, suggested to Ānanda that some place should be provided where they might offer flowers and perfumes in the name of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, when the Buddha was away on his periodical tours.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After consultation with the Buddha, Ānanda obtained, with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna's&lt;/a&gt; assistance, a fruit from the bodhi-tree at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gayaa,Gayā')"&gt;Gayā&lt;/a&gt;, and had it planted at the gateway of Jetavana in the presence of a large and distinguished gathering, including &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; Kosala and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seed was planted by Anāthapindika in a golden jar filled with fragrant earth.  Immediately a sapling sprang up, fifty cubits tall, with five branches, each fifty cubits long.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king poured round the tree perfumed water from eight hundred jars of gold and silver.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to consecrate the new tree, the Buddha, at Ānanda's request, sat under it for one night, in the rapture of samāpatti.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the tree was planted by Ānanda, it became known as Ānandabodhi (J.iv.228-30).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilgrims who came to the Buddha at Jetavana were in the habit of paying respect to the Ānandabodhi (J.ii.321).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paduma_jat_261,Paduma Jātaka')"&gt;Paduma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479,Kālingabodhi Jātaka')"&gt;Kālingabodhi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; were both preached in reference to this bodhi-tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ālokalena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave in the cleft of a mighty primeval landslide, not far from the modern Matale in Ceylon.  According to tradition it was here that the Buddhist scriptures were first reduced to writing in Ceylon under the patronage of a chieftain of King Vattagāmani.  The Burmese believe that Buddhaghosa's Atthakathās were also written in this spot (Mhv.xxiii.100f.  See PLC.43f).  In the eighteenth century King Vijayarājasīha built images of the Buddha in the rock cave.  Cv.xcviii.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Āsanatthavika Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In a previous birth, while wandering about in the forest, having lost his way, he came across the cetiya named Uttama, of Sikhī Buddha.  Calling to mind the Buddha's good qualities, he uttered his praises and paid him homage at the altar in the cetiya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven kappas ago he was king seven times under the name of Atulya (Ap.i.255).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

We are told that though he was no "Ariya" he was a dignitary of great power.  He laid waste the kingdom and entered the capital Subhagiri.  There he seized the Tooth Relic and the costly treasures which were kept with it and took them back to King Kulasekhara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cv.xc.43-7. Kulasekhara reigned 1268-1308. His general Āriyacakkavatti is mentioned in a South Indian Inscription (No.  110, in the Annual Report of Epigraphy, Southern Circle, Madras, 1903).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ābhassara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brahma-world where live radiant devas from whose bodies rays of light are emitted, like lightning.  It belongs to the Rūpaloka and is in the plane of second jhāna (Abhs.  v.3; Compendium 138, n.4).  The devas living there subsist on joy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(pītibhakkha) (S.i.114.; DhA.iii.258; J.vi.55).  Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition (A.ii.127; but see Abhs.  v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas).  From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying "aho sukham, aho sukham." This sound is the best of sounds.  These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena abhisaññā parisaññā) (A.iii.202; D.  iii.219).  Their world forms the third station of consciousness (viññānatthiti), they are of uniform body, but their perceptions are diverse (ekattakāyā nānat-tasaññino) (A.iv.40, 401; D.ii.69; D.iii.253).  During the periods of the development of the world many beings are born in the Abhassara realm and they are then called the highest of the devas, yet even they change their condition (A.v.60).  In lists of devas (E.g., M.i.289) they are given below the Appamānābhā and above the Subhā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhisattas are sometimes born in the Ābhassara world (AA.i.73; J.i.406, 473; M.i.329; , MA.i.553; SA.i.162), but they are never born in Arūpa worlds even when they have developed Arūpa-jhānas.  Baka Brahmā was born in Ābhassara after having passed through Vehapphala and Subhakinna, and it was then that he conceived the belief that he was eternal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited him and convinced him of the error of his belief (J.iii.359).  When the universe is dissolved after the lapse of a long epoch and is again evolved, beings are mostly born in the Ābhassara world.  When, sooner or later, the world begins to re-evolve (vivattati), the Brahmavimāna appears, but it is empty.  Then some being or other, either because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves the Ābhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavimāna.  Others follow his example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks of himself as Brahmā, the eternal, etc.  (D.iii.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When inhabitants of the Ābhassara-world are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had in the brahma-world itself.  As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253).  Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.865) says that their birth on earth is opapātika (by spontaneous regeneration) and they are mind-born (manomaya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the occasions when the world is destroyed by fire, the fire spread up to the Ābhassara-world; when by water, the water rises to the Subhakinna; when by wind, the wind reaches to the Vehapphala (CypA.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.i.29; VibhA.520; cp.  DA.ii.510), the Ābhassaras are so called because radiance spreads from their bodies in all directions, like flames from a torch (dandadīpikāya acci viya etesam sarīrato ābhā chijjitvā chijjitvā patantī viya sarati visaratī ti Abhassarā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scholiast of the Candābha Jātaka (q.v.), beings who meditate on the Sun and Moon are born in this world.  The Moon appears at the wish of the Abhassara Brahmās.  See Candimā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumāra-Kassapa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kumāra-Kassapa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He was foremost among those who had the gift of varied and versatile discourse (cittakathikānam) (A.i.24).  His mother was the daughter of a banker of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, and she, having failed to obtain her parent's consent to become a nun, married and, with her husband's consent, joined the Order, not knowing that she was with child.  When her condition was discovered her colleagues consulted &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, who declared that she was no true nun.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, on being consulted, entrusted the matter to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaali,Upāli')"&gt;Upāli&lt;/a&gt;, who had it fully investigated by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt; and other residents of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, and he gave his finding in the assembly, in the presence of the king, that the nun was innocent.  (For details see J.i.148; Upāli's handling of the case won the Buddha's special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172).  When the boy was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven.  The boy came to be called Kumāra, because he joined the Order so young and was of royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kumāra Kassapa.  Once when Kumāra Kassapa was meditating in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana,Andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt;, an anāgāmī Brahmā, who had been his companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer.  This led to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vammiika_sutta,Vammika Sutta')"&gt;Vammika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa became an arahant.  (For Kumāra Kassapa's story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f).  His mother, too, developed insight and attained to arahantship.  It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe.  Kassapa, realising that her great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that she might love him the less.  The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that very day (DhA.iii.147).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety towards that end.  When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous asceticism on the summit of a mountain.  (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa's companions were also Pukkusāti, Dārucīriya, Dabba Mallaputta and Sabhiya; see also UdA.80f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses of deep significance ascribed to Kumāra-Kassapa are found in the Theragāthā (vv.201.202).  Although it is said that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are extremely scanty.  The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with Pāyāsi, as related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/payasi,Pāyāsi Sutta')"&gt;Pāyāsi Sutta&lt;/a&gt;; but this cannot be correct for, according to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala,Dhammapāla')"&gt;Dhammapāla&lt;/a&gt; (VvA.297), the events of the Pāyāsi Sutta took place after the Buddha's death.  The Sutta, however, does justify Kassapa's reputation.  (For his praises see also MA.i.500f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa's upasampadā took place in his twentieth year.  A doubt arose as to whether this was valid because, according to the rule, twenty years must be completed for upasampadā.  The Buddha held that in reckoning the age the time spent in the mother's womb could also be included.  Vin.i.93; Sp.iv.867.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesakārī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin maiden of Bārānasī.  Having seen a young monk begging alms, she asked her mother why men in the prime of life should renounce the world.  Her mother told her of the appearance of the Buddha in the world.  An upāsaka who heard the conversation told her more of the Buddha and taught her the saranas and the sīlas.  Later he told her of the nature of the body, and she, reflecting thereon, became a sotāpanna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death she became one of Sakka's women-attendants, and her story was related to Moggallāna by Sakka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Komāyaputta Jātaka (No.299)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some ascetics in Himavā failed to take their duties seriously and spent their time in eating and making merry.  They had a monkey who provided them with amusement.  One day when the ascetics went to the plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin ascetic named Komāyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics.  The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told at the Pubbārāma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.  At the Buddha's request, Moggallāna made their house shake in order to frighten them.  J.ii.447f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

She had beautiful hair which, however, she lost, owing to the machinations of a rival.  She once stole clothes from some men who lay asleep, and on another occasion gave alms to a monk.  She was later born in an ocean vimāna as a naked peta with lovely hair; some merchants, while going to Suvannabhūmi, saw her, and on learning her story gave clothes on her behalf to a pious man in their company, and as a result clothes immediately appeared on her.  Later the merchants gave alms to the Buddha in her name, and she was born in Tāvatimsa.  Pv.i.10; PvA.46ff.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimpakka Jātaka (No.85)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a caravan.  During a journey through a forest he gave orders to his men not to eat any fruit without his leave.  Seeing the fruit of a kimpakka-tree, which in appearance and flavour resembled a mango, some of the men ate of the fruit and died in spite of efforts to save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk who was stirred to lust by the sight of a beautifully dressed woman in Sāvatthi.  Lusts of the senses are like the fruit of the kimpakka-tree, sweet and attractive in the hour of enjoyment, but leading later to death.  J.i.367f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokālika Jātaka (No.331)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Brahmadatta was very talkative, and his minister, the Bodhisatta, sought an opportunity of admonishing him.  This opportunity occurred while they were watching a crow's nest in which a cuckoo had laid an egg.  The crow watched over it and fed the young cuckoo after its birth.  One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away.  The king inquired of the Bodhisatta the reason for this, and he explained that the garrulous who talk in and out of season meet with a similar fate.  The king was cured of his evil habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Kokālika, who is identified with the young cuckoo.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimsukā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk asks a fellow-monk as to when a monk's insight is said to be fully purified.  When he really understands the arising and the passing away of the six-fold sense sphere answers the other.  Not being satisfied, the first monk asks others who, in turn, declare in similar terms of the five upādānakkhandhas, the four mahābhūtas, etc.  Finally he asks the Buddha, who says that the answers of the monks were like those of men who, on being asked what the kimsuka (Judas) tree was like, describe it, not as it really is, but as each one of them happens to have seen it.  The Buddha explains the monk's question by means of the parable of a city, strongly guarded, having six gates and a watchful warden of the gates, receiving messengers from various quarters (S.iv.191ff).  Cf.  Kimsukopama Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

For five hundred births they thus return hatred for hatred.  Finally the girl is reborn in Sāvatthi as a woman, and the hen as an ogress.  The ogress eats two of the woman's children, and is about to eat the third when the woman seeks refuge in the monastery.  The Buddha admonished them to return good for evil and they become friends.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kisa-Vaccha &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(also called Vaccha Kisa) (J.v.150, 267)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hermit (isi), the chief disciple of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga,Sarabhanga')"&gt;Sarabhanga&lt;/a&gt;.  Desiring solitude, he lived in the park of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakii,Dandaki')"&gt;Dandaki&lt;/a&gt;, near Kumbhavatī in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalinga,Kalinga')"&gt;Kalinga&lt;/a&gt;.  A certain courtesan of the city walking about in the park, having lost the king's favour, saw Kisa-Vaccha, and considering the sight an ill-omen, she spat on him and threw her tooth stick at his head.  That same day she received again the patronage of the king and decided that it was as a result of spitting on the hermit.  Later, when the purohita lost his office, she advised him to do as she had done, and by coincidence he, too, was restored.  Some time after, the king going to quell a border rising, was advised to spit on the ascetic and throw his tooth stick at him; in this way he would find good luck.  The king followed this advice, all his soldiers doing likewise.  The king's general, a supporter of Kisa-Vaccha, bathed the holy man, and on being told that the Gods would destroy the kingdom unless apology were made, urged the king to apologise.  The king was, however, unwilling, and the whole tract of Kalinga, sixty leagues in extent, was turned into a waste; only three people escaped unhurt - Kisa-Vaccha, the king's general, and Matuposaka Rāma.  Kisa-Vaccha himself was taken in a palanquin to Sarabhanga by two of Sarabhanga's pupils (J.iii.463, 469; v.133-6; MA.ii.599ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was evidently well known in India and is often referred to (E.g., J.v.267; DA.i.266).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kisa-Vaccha is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (E .g., J.vi.99).

Kondañña.&lt;/b&gt;-The second of the twenty-four Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sixteen asankheyya and one hundred thousand kappas of pāramī, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;he was born in Rammavatī, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his father being King Sunanda and his mother Sujātā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to the Kondaññagotta and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his body was twenty-eight cubits in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten thousand years he lived as a layman in three palaces - Ruci, Suruci and Subha (Rāma, Surāmā and Subha, according to BuA); &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his chief wife was Rucidevī and his son Vījitasena.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left home in a chariot, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;practised austerities for ten months and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;was given a meal of milk-rice by Yasodharā, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;daughter of a merchant in Sunanda, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;grass for his seat by the Ājīvaka Sunanda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bodhi was a Sālakalyāni tree, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his first sermon was preached to ten crores of monks in the Devavana near Amaravatī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He held three assemblies of his disciples, the first led by Subhadda, the second by Vijitasena and the third by Udena, all of whom had become arahants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died at the age of one hundred thousand at Candārāmā, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the thūpa erected over his relics was seven leagues in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chief disciples were Bhadda and Subhadda among monks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Tissā and Upatissā among nuns, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his constant attendant being Anuruddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chief patrons were Sona and Upasona among laymen and Nandā and Sirimā among laywomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a king, Vijitāvī of Candavatī.  He left his kingdom, joined the Order and was later reborn in the Brahma-world.  Bu.iii.; BuA.107ff; J.i.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khajjanīya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well-taught Ariyan disciple, remembering his past lives, realises how, in the past, he has been a prey to the body, feelings, perception, activities and consciousness; how he is still their prey, and will be so in the future, too, if he be enamoured of them.  Thus realising, he conceives disgust for the body, etc., is repelled by them, and obtains release from them.  He thereby attains freedom and becomes aware that he is free.  S.iii.86-91; this sutta is wrongly titled Sīha in the Samyutta text; see KS.iii.72, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was also preached by Mahinda in the Nandana grove on the fifth day of his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xv.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.32) the sutta is referred to as the Khajja-nīyapariyāya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumbhanda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kumbhanda.-A Nigantha for whom Pandukābhaya built a hermitage, named after him, near the Gāmani Tank.  Mhv.x.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumbhanda.-A class of spirits mentioned with Yakkhas, Asuras and Nāgas.  They live in the South and Virūlha is their king (D.ii.257; D.iii.198).  In the Vidhurapandita Jātaka (J.vi.272), Kumbhīra (q.v.) is mentioned as one of their chiefs.  They had huge stomachs, and their genital organs were as big as pots, hence their name.  DA.iii.964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khajjopanaka-Pañha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, as a result of the conspiracy of Senaka and the other ministers of Vedeha, Mahosadha was compelled to flee from the Court and live as a potter outside the city gates, the devatā of the king's parasol, wishing to see him reinstated, appeared to the king and put to him several questions.  The king consulted Senaka and his colleagues, but they could find no solution.  The deity appeared again to him and said he was like a man who, wanting a fire, blows a firefly, crumbling over it cow-dung and grass, or, wanting milk, milks the cow's horn.  She then threatened the king with death if her questions were not answered.  In despair, the king sent for Mahosadha (J.vi.371f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is evidently this story which is mentioned elsewhere (J.iii.197) as a separate Jātaka, but no details are given, and the reader is referred to the Khajjopanaka-Pañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kittisirimegha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Moggallāna II.  and king of Ceylon from 656 A.C.  The length of his reign is uncertain; he was slain by Mahānāga (Cv.xli.65-92; see also Cv.Trs.i.61, n.2).  Rūpavatī, queen of Parakkamabāhu I., was probably a lineal descendant of this king.  Cv.lxxiii.136, 142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mittā, sister of Vijayabāhu I.  and of a Pandu king (Pandurājā).  Mānābharana and Sirivallabha were his brothers, and be married Vijayabāhu's daughter, Lokanāthā (Cv.lix.42, 44).  After Vijayabāhu's death, Kittisirimegha ruled over the province of Dvādasasahassaka at Mahānāgahula with Mittā and Jayabāhu I.  (Cv.lxi.22-7).  After the death of Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha took over also his province of Rohana (Cv.lxiii.2).  When Gajabāhu succeeded Vikkamabāhu II.  Kittisirimegha fought against him, but was defeated by the king's officer Gokanna, and retired to his own province, where he was later joined by Parakkamabāhu at Sankhanāyakatthalī (Cv.lxiii.20, 34, 43).  Parakkama stayed with him, being adopted as his son, and his upanayana was held under Kittisirimegha's orders at Baddalatthalī (Cv.lxiv.18, 25, 36).  When, however, Parakkama escaped from the prince's protection, he sent an army to capture him, but without success (Cv.lxvi.57ff).  Later, Parakkama himself went to see Kittisirimegha in the company of his mother Ratnāvalī, and Kittisirimegha gave orders to his followers to regard the prince as their master.  He himself died soon after (Cv.xvii.16, 55, 60, 83, 87).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kittisirimegha.-Son of Mānābharana by his second queen Pabhāvatī.  His grandfather was Sirivallabha (Cv.lxiv.24).  His father, on his deathbed, repented of the harm he had done to the Buddha's religion and asked his son to do reparation by joining Parakkamabāhu I.  The latter, on hearing this, sent for Kittisirimegha and made him a member of his court (Cv.lxxii.303, 311).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkutamitta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hunter.  The daughter of a rich man in Rājagaha looks out of her window on the seventh storey and seeing the hunter pass through the street, falls in love with him.  Learning from her slave that he is leaving the city the next day, she leaves her home secretly, joins Kukkutamitta on the road and elopes with him.  Seven sons are born to them who, in course of time, marry and set up households of their own.  One day, perceiving that the whole family is ripe for conversion, the Buddha goes to the place where Kukkutamitta's nets are spread, leaves there his footprint and sits down under a tree.  The hunter, having caught nothing, suspects that someone has set the animals free and on seeing the Buddha draws his bow.  By the Buddha's power he is rooted to the spot, and likewise his sons who come with their wives to seek him.  Kukkutamitta's wife also comes, and seeing what has happened exclaims in riddling phrase: "Do not kill my father." (It transpires that she had become a sotāpanna while yet a girl.) The family ask pardon of the Buddha, and all become sotāpannas.  When the monks hear of this, they complain that Kukkutamitta's wife, though a sotāpanna, had all this while assisted her husband to take life.  The Buddha assures them that such is not the case.  A man may take poison in his hand, but if there be no wound there no harm comes to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous existence, a county treasurer bid against a city treasurer for the principal share in the building of a shrine for the relics of Kassapa Buddha.  When the city treasurer bid more than the county treasurer possessed, the latter offered to devote himself to the service of the shrine, together with his wife, his seven sons and their wives.  Kukkutamitta was the county treasurer.  DhA.iii.24-31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kiñchanda Jātaka (No.511)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chaplain of the king of Benares, who took bribes and gave false judgments, is reborn to a state of suffering all day, but as a result of having given a mango fruit to a woman who was keeping the fast, he enjoys great glory throughout the night in a charming mango-grove.  His king, who had become an ascetic, eats a mango which had been carried by the river from this grove, and wishes for some more.  He is transported by a river nymph (Uppalavannā of this age) to the mango-grove, where he hears from his erstwhile chaplain the story of his alternate bliss and misery.  The Buddha related the story to some of his lay disciples who were keeping the fast (J.v.1ff).  The king is identified with the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundakakucchisindhava Jātaka (No.254)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder was lodging in a poor old woman's house on the road from Benares to Uttarāpatha.  During his stay there his thoroughbred mare foaled, and the foal was given to the woman at her request, in part payment of her charges.  She brought up the foal as though he were her own child.  Some time after, the Bodhisatta, who was then a householder, happened to pass the same way and discovered the thoroughbred's presence by the behaviour of his own horses.  The woman agreed to part with the foal to him for a large price on condition that he should be provided with all manner of luxuries.  The Bodhisatta kept his word, and when the king came to inspect his horses, made the foal, who knew his own worth, exhibit his marvellous powers.  The king installed him as his state horse, and thereafter the lordship of all India passed into the king's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Sāriputta.  Once, when the Buddha was returning to Sāvatthi after a tour, the citizens decided to celebrate his arrival by each one taking on himself the task of feeding a certain number of monks in the Buddha's retinue.  A poor old woman wished to feed a monk, but all the monks were already allotted, only Sāriputta remaining.  She invited him to her house, and he accepted her invitation.  When it became known that Sāriputta was to feed with her, the king and all the rich citizens of Sāvatthi sent her food and garments and money to help in her entertainment of the Elder.  As a result, through the kindness of Sāriputta, she became rich in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta is identified with the thoroughbred of the Jātaka (J.ii.286ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is evidently the same story as that which, in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.325), is called the Kundakasindhayapotaka Jātaka.  But there the story is related, not in reference to Sāriputta, but to the Buddha himself, because he accepted a cake of rice-husks from the slave-woman &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa,Punnā')"&gt;Punnā&lt;/a&gt;.  This is probably due to some confusion with two or more stories of similar import.  See also&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kundakapuuva_jat_109,Kundakapūva Jātaka')"&gt;Kundakapūva Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kolambahālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon, where Bhalluka pitched his camp (Mhv.xxv.80; see also Mhv.  Trs.176, n.2).  It is probably identical with Kolambālaka (Mhv.xxxiii.42), in which case it was near the Titthārāma, in the neighbourhood of the northern gate of Anurādhapura.  There was also a monastery called Kolambahalāka founded by Sūratissa, and said to have been near Raheraka (Mhv.xxi.5).  The Kolambahālaka-parivena was the residence of the monk Dāthāvedhaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khattiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khattiya Sutta.-A conversation between a devatā and the Buddha regarding the four best things of the world - best of bipeds, quadrupeds, of wives, and of sons.  S.i.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khattiya Sutta.-A conversation between Jīnussonī and the Buddha on the ends of their efforts as envisaged by khattiyas, brahmanas, house-holders, women, thieves and recluses.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesadhātu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very high rank bestowed by the Sinhalese kings.  It appears to have corresponded to the modern Orders.  It may have originated in the members of the Order being entrusted with the care of the Hair Relic (Kesadhātu), which was brought to Ceylon in the reign of Moggallāna I (Cv.xxxix.49).  This duty afterwards evidently became a mere formality.  The word Kesadhātu may be an abbreviation of the fuller Kesadhātunāyaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first come across the term in the time of Vijayabāhu I., when a Kesadhātu, Kassapa by name, became governor of Rohana (Cv.lvii.65f).  Parakkamabāhu I.  conferred the title on his general, the Dandādhināyaka Rakkha.  Cv.lxx.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokālika &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kokālika (Kokāliya).&lt;/b&gt;-A monk, one of the chief partisans of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;.  Knowing the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; might, he was, at first, reluctant to join in Devadatta's plot against him, but later allowed himself to be persuaded on hearing the scheme explained (Vin.ii.196; iii.171).  When the monks blamed Devadatta for his misdeeds, Kokālika was always ready to defend him (Vin.iii.174).  When Devadatta's gains diminished, Kokālika went about praising him, his birth, accomplishments and holiness, and many believed him (J.ii.438f).  He was a great friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa,Thullanandā')"&gt;Thullanandā&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.iv.335).  We are told that once he expressed resentment because he had never been asked to recite the texts; so one day the monks gave him his chance.  He ate his favourite soup, and at sundown, wearing a blue lower robe and an outer robe of white and carrying an elegantly carved fan, he appeared in the assembly.  But when he tried to recite sweat poured from his body and he was utterly confused.  Henceforth the monks knew that his claim to learning was but pretence (J.ii.65f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Jātakas are related showing how, in previous births also, Kokālika had come to grief because of his fondness for talk and how he had been the accomplice of Devadatta.  He is identified with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the jackal in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/daddara_jat_172_304,Daddara Jātaka')"&gt;Daddara Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.65ff) and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sihakotthuka_jat_188,Sīhakotthuka Jātaka')"&gt;Sīhakotthuka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.108); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ass in the lion's skin in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihacamma_jat_189,Sīhacamma Jātaka')"&gt;Sīhacamma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.110); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the talkative tortoise in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kacchapa_jat_178_215_273,Kacchapa Jātaka')"&gt;Kacchapa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.175); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the crow who praised the jackal (Devadatta) in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambukhaadaka_jat_294,Jambukhādaka Jātaka')"&gt;Jambukhādaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.438); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the young cuckoo who lost his life because he sang, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokaalika_jat_331,Kokālika Jātaka')"&gt;Kokālika Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (iii.102); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tawny-brown brahmin in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkaariya_jat_481,Takkāriya Jātaka')"&gt;Takkāriya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (iv.242; but see Kokālika 2); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and the wicked deity in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samuddavanija_jat_466,Samuddavāgija Jātaka')"&gt;Samuddavāgija Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (iv.166).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.473; AA.ii.850; SA.i.167) that this Kokālika was a brahmin and a pupil of Devadatta, and that he was called Mahā Kokālika to distinguish him from another Kokālika who was similarly called Cūla Kokālika (see Kokālika 2).  There seems to be great confusions in the stories of these two men - if they were really two.  In the Jātaka Commentary, for instance, the introductory stories of several of the Jātakas refer to the Takkāriya Jātaka for details of Kokālika, obviously having in mind Devadatta's partisan; but the introductory story of the Takkāriya Jātaka is identical with that related elsewhere of Cūla Kokālika.  See also DhA.iv.91f, where the story of the talkative tortoise is related to Kokālika of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokaalika_jat_331,Kokālika Sutta')"&gt;Kokālika Sutta&lt;/a&gt; which, according to Buddhaghosa (SNA.ii.473) refers to Cūla Kokālika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vyaggha_jat_272,Vyaggha Jātaka')"&gt;Vyaggha Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.356) Kokālika is mentioned as having tried to persuade &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; to go with him to his own country and as having been very angry when they refused.  Possibly this story also refers to Cūla Kokālika.  See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kokālika (Kokāliya)&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk, also called Cūla Kokālika to distinguish him from Kokālika (1).  He was the son of Kokāli-setthi of Kokāli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in Kokāli.  Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy season with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence.  After the rains, as the Elders were about to return, Kokālika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blamed them for not showing them hospitality.  The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kokālika, who had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed.  The Elders promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour.  The gifts were divided among the monks, Kokālika not receiving a share.  He thereupon became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place.  The people were annoyed, and insisted that Kokālika should either bring them back or depart himself.  The Elders refused to return, and Kokālika, in great anger, sought the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples.  Having three times accused the Elders of sinful desires, he left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, but boils immediately came out on his body, swelling and bursting.  Groaning with pain, he fell down at the gate of Jetavana.  His spiritual teacher, the anāgāmī Brahmā, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tudu,Tudu')"&gt;Tudu&lt;/a&gt;, hearing his cries, came to him and begged him to seek forgiveness from the Elders.  But he cursed the Brahmā and refused to listen to him.  Kokālika died and was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paduma,Paduma-niraya')"&gt;Paduma-niraya&lt;/a&gt;.  S.i.149ff; A.v.171f; SN.123f; SNA.ii.473f; J.iv.242f; AA.ii.850; SA.i.167f; DhA.iv.91f The different sources vary in a few minor details; the Jātaka version is the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in reference to this incident that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkaariya_jat_481,Takkāriya Jātaka')"&gt;Takkāriya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmā &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sahampati,Sahampati')"&gt;Sahampati&lt;/a&gt; informed the Buddha of Kokālika's birth in the Paduma-niraya (S.i.151; SN.  p.125).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kokālika Sutta was preached in reference to this Kokālika.  See also Kokālika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokālika is mentioned as an example of a person guilty of misdemeanour regarding the Buddha's disciples (Tathāgatasāvake micchāpatipanno).  AA.i.335, 466.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Konāgamana (Konāgamana)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa.  He was born in the Subhagavatī Park in Sobhavatī, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttarā.  He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattā and their son was Satthavāha.  Konāgamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka.  His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree.  His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahā-sāla tree.  He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand.  His body was thirty cubits in height.  He died in the Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand.  His relics were scattered.  His chief disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya.  His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen.  The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilā.  He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sanghārāma half a league in extent (J.i.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Buddha's birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudīpa, hence he was called Kanakāgamana, Konāgamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konāgamana visited their Island (then known as Varadīpa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahānoma garden at Vaddhamāna, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine.  At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth.  At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l.  Kanakadattā) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree.  The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship.  He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Konāgamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191).  Konāgamana held the uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konāgamana is called Kanakamuni, Konākamuni, and Kanakaparvata.  A Thūpa, erected on the spot where Konāgamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: Inscrip.  of Asoka, p.165).  Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., ii.19) says he saw thūpas at Konāgamana's birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father after the Enlightenment.  Fa Hien (Travels, p.36) saw thūpas at the latter place and also at the place of the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokālika Jātaka (No.331)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Brahmadatta was very talkative, and his minister, the Bodhisatta, sought an opportunity of admonishing him.  This opportunity occurred while they were watching a crow's nest in which a cuckoo had laid an egg.  The crow watched over it and fed the young cuckoo after its birth.  One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away.  The king inquired of the Bodhisatta the reason for this, and he explained that the garrulous who talk in and out of season meet with a similar fate.  The king was cured of his evil habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Kokālika, who is identified with the young cuckoo.  J.iii.102f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kurandaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave, probably in Ceylon.  It contained beautiful paintings of the renunciation of seven Buddhas, but the Elder Cittagutta (q.v.), who lived in the cave for a long time, never saw them because he had never lifted his eyes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a great ironwood (nāga) tree at the entrance to the cave.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder, at the request of the king, once went to visit him, but after seven days, not being happy in the palace, he returned to Kurandaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ketumatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ketumatī.-The future name of Bārānasī.  It will be at the head of eighty-four thousand towns, the capital of the Cakkavatti Sankha and the birthplace of the Buddha Metteyya.  D.iii.75f; J.vi.594; Anāgat., vv.8, 30; according to v.8 it is the same as Kusāvati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ketumatī.-A river in the Himalaya region.  Vessantara, with his wife and children, had a meal on its banks, bathed and drank in the river, and from there went to Nālika.  J.vi.518f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Ketumatī.-The palace of the deva Mahāsena (a previous birth of Nāgasena).  (Mil., p.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Ketumatī.-The Pali name for the Burmese city of Taungu (Bode: op.  cit., 45).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketumatī is in Jeyyavaddhanarattha.  It was once the capital of King Mahāsirijeyyasūra who possessed a famous elephant, called Devanāga.  Buddhism was established in Ketumatī by a monk from Ceylon who was named Mahāparakkama.  It later became the residence of famous monks.  Sās., pp.80, 81; see also 101, 118, 162.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundaliya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paribbajaka,Paribbājaka')"&gt;Paribbājaka&lt;/a&gt; who visits the Buddha at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana,Añjanavana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt; in Sāketa.  He asks the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; what profit comes from the Buddha's way of living.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation leads to a discussion of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga,bojjhangas')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;, the&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthāna')"&gt;satipatthāna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and virtuous ways of behaviour.  At the end of the discussion Kundaliya becomes the Buddha's follower.  S.v.73ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korandapupphiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant.  Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the footprint of the Buddha Vipassī and offered to it a koranda-plant in bloom.  Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Vītamala (Ap.i.206).  He is probably to be identified with Ramanīyavihārī.  ThagA.i.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant.  He was a woodsman in the time of Tissa Buddha, and having seen three footprints of the Buddha, he offered to him a flowering koranda-plant.  In all subsequent births his skin was the colour of the koranda-flower.  The same verses appear in two places in the Apadāna with very slight variations (Ap.ii.383, 434).  Perhaps these are two distinct persons, because in the Theragāthā Commentary the verses appear twice - once under the name of Sugandha (ThagA.i.81) and once under that of Sabbamitta (ThagA.i.270).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khañjadeva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ten chief warriors of Dutthagāmanī.  He was the youngest son of Abhaya, a householder of Mahisadonika in the Nakulanaga district.  His name was Deva, but because of a slight limp he came to be known as Khañjadeva.  When out hunting with the villagers, he would chase and catch buffaloes, grasp their leg with his hand, whirl them round his head and dash them on the ground, breaking their bones.  Kākavannatissa, hearing of this, caused him to be brought to the court.  Later, Khañjadeva took part in Dutthagāmanī's campaigns.  Mhv.xxiii.3, 78ff.  See also Ras.ii.99f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kummāsapinda Jātaka (No.416)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was servant to a rich man in Benares, and having received four portions of sour gruel for wages, gave them to four Pacceka Buddhas.  After death he was born as heir to the king of Benares, and made the daughter of the Kosala king his chief queen.  Remembering his previous life, he composed a song about it; the song became very popular, though no one understood its import.  The queen, having been promised a boon, chose to know the meaning of the song, and the king, having summoned the people from twelve leagues round, explained the allusions.  The queen, too, revealed how she had once been a slave in the court of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambahattha,Ambattha')"&gt;Ambattha&lt;/a&gt; and had given alms to a holy monk.  She is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rahulamata,Rāhulamātā')"&gt;Rāhulamātā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"&gt;Mallikā&lt;/a&gt;; she was a garlandmaker's daughter, and one day gave three portions of sour gruel to the Buddha.  That same day she became the chief queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;.  J.iii.405ff.  Cp.  the third story of the Jātakamālā, also Divyāvadāna, p.88, and Kathāsaritsāgara xxvii.79ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khiddāpadosikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of devas who live in the Cātummahārājika-world.  For ages they spend their time in laughter and in sport of sensual lusts.  In consequence their self-possession is corrupted and they fall from their state (D.i.19; PsA.441; NidA.i.108).  They are so called because they are corrupted and are destroyed by sport (khiddāya padussanti, vinassanti) (DA.i.113).  It is said that while playing about in such pleasances as Nandanavana, Cittalatāvana and Phārusakavana, they forget to eat and drink and fade away like flowers.  Their death is due to self-consciousness (attasañcetanā) (AA.ii.544).  They are, as it were, burnt up by their infatuation (mohassa anudaha-natāya-mohanavasena hi tesam satisammoso) (VibhA.498).  They were present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.260).  v.l.  Khiddāpadūsikā.  &lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khaya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khaya Sutta.-Preached to Rādha.  The body, etc., are liable to destruction.  That which, by nature, is transient and perishing must be put away.  S.iii.197, 199, 201.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khaya Sutta.-All things are liable to destruction.  S.iv.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khaya Sutta.-The Buddha exhorts the monks to cultivate the seven bojjhangas, which lead to the destruction of craving.  In answer to a question of Udāyī he goes on to explain how the cultivation is pursued.  S.v.86f.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesadhātuvamsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A book containing the history of the Buddha's Hair Relic.  The Relic was brought to Ceylon from India by Silākāla in the reign of Moggallāna I.  The king placed it in a crystal casket in a beautiful building with a picture of Dīpankara's city (?) and established a festival in its honour.  Silākāla was appointed custodian of the Relic (Cv.xxxix.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;The Kesadhātuvamsa is not now available.  It was evidently easily obtainable at the time of the writing of the first part of the Cūlavamsa (See, e.g., Cv.xxxix.56).  It seems to have been quite distinct from the Chakesadhātuvamsa (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumbhakāra Jātaka (No.408)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a potter in Benares, and to his house came four Pacceka Buddhas - Karandu, Naggaji, Nimi and Dummukha - from Nandamūla-pabbhāra.  He welcomed them and asked them the stories of their renunciation.  Having heard them, both he and his wife wished to leave the world, but his wife, deceiving him, went before him, leaving him to look after their son and daughter.  When the children were old enough he, too, became an ascetic, and though he met his wife later he refused to have anything to do with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son was Rāhula and the daughter Uppalavannā, the wife being Rāhulamātā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to five hundred monks who had lustful thoughts at midnight.  The Buddha read their thoughts and visited them with Ananda (J.iii.375ff).  See also the Pānīya Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khuddakapātha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fifteen books of the Khuddaka Nikāya, generally mentioned first in this list (E.g., DA.i.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its rightful claim to be included as part of the Tipitaka was disputed both by the Dīghabhānakas and the Majjhimabhānakas (DA.i.15).  It is generally acknowledged (for a discussion see Law, Pāli Lit., i.7f; 34f) that the work is of later composition and that it contains extracts from earlier works.  It may have been composed in Ceylon, and it is significant that its first mention as a canonical book should occur only in the commentaries.  It is not mentioned even in the Milindapañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book consists of nine sections on texts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saranattaya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasasikkhā-pada, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dvattimsākāra, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumārapañha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and five suttas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangala, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirokudda, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nidhikanda, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metta&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;- all found elsewhere in the canon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary the book derives its name from the first four texts, which are shorter than the remaining five.  KhpA.13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary was written by Buddhaghosa.  See also Gv.59, 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuvera (Kubera)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru,Uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;His royal residence is Ālakamandā and his citadel Visāna.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His messengers are Tatolā, Tattolā, Tatotalā, Ojasi, Tejasi, Tatojasi, Sūra, Rāja, Arittha and Nemi.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His lotus-lake is called Dharanī.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His sons are all called Inda (D.iii.201f).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He rules over the northern clime and is lord of the Yakkhas, with a splendid retinue (D.ii.257).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He is a follower of the Buddha (SN.v.379).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana,Vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was once a brahmin called Kuvera and owned a sugar-cane farm, where he worked seven mills.  The produce of one mill he gave in charity, and when his profits increased he gave alms for twenty thousand years.  After death he was born as one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummakārājika-devas')"&gt;Cātummakārājika-devas&lt;/a&gt; (DA.iii.966; SNA.i.369f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In literature the name Kuvera signifies the god of wealth, and his city, Ālakamandā, is said to embody all prosperity (E.g., Cv.xxxvii.106; xxxix.5; lxxx.5).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had nine treasures (Cv.lxxxvii.31; see Hopkins' Epic Mythology, 142f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka,Punnaka')"&gt;Punnaka&lt;/a&gt; calls himself the minister of Kuvera (J.vi.307, 325).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuvera is mentioned in a list of those who reached heaven through generosity (J.vi.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundadhāna Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was proclaimed the first among those who received food tickets (salāka) (A.i.24).  He came of a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and his name was Dhāna.  He knew the Vedas by heart, and when advanced in years, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  From that day, however, in all his movements the form of a young woman followed him wherever he went, though he himself could not see the figure.  This caused great merriment and evoked many sarcastic remarks, which he could not understand.  When he went for alms women would put into his bowl two portions of food, saying, "One is for your Reverence and the other for your friend, the young lady, your companion." In the monastery the novices and young monks would point at him and say: "Look, our venerable one has become a konda" (gallant?).  From this he became known as Konda- or Kundadhāna.  Driven to distraction by this teasing, he became abusive and was reported to the Buddha, who hade him be patient as he was only being pursued by the remnant of an evil kamma.  Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of Kundadhāna, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no longer go round for alms.  This enabled him to concentrate his mind, and he became an arahant.  Thereupon the figure of the woman disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhāna's claim to be the first among receivers of salāka was due to the fact that he it was who received the first food-ticket when the Buddha visited &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahā-Subhaddā at Ugganagara, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culla-Subhaddā at Sāketa, and also &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Sunāparanta-janapada.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only khīnāsavas were allowed to accompany the Buddha on these visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhāna's determination to attain this special eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  Once he gave Padumuttara a well-ripened "comb" of bananas when the Buddha arose from a long trance.  As a result he became king of the devas eleven times and king of men twenty-four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was an earthbound sprite in the time of Kassapa Buddha.  Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her hair, adjusting her garments, and so on.  The second monk, seeing his friend return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing to perform the uposatha with him.  Realising the effect of his practical joke, the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks was for ever spoilt.  The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadhāna his evil kamma pursued him, as seen above.  AA.i.146ff; Thag.A.i.62ff; also Ap.i.81f; Thag.15. The version given in Dh A.iii.52f differs very slightly in certain details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhāna was among those to whom the Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta, and was therefore probably a friend of Anuruddha and the other Sākyan nobles present on that occasion (M.i.462).  v.l.  Konda-dhāna, Konthadhāna, Kuddadhāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotapabbata (Kotipabbata)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain in Rohana; near it was the village of Kitti (Mhv.xxiii.55).  There was a monastery on Kotapabbatta called the Kotapabbata-vihāra.  This was the residence of the Sāmanera who was afterwards born as Dutthagāmanī (Mhv.xxii.25); also of Mahā-Summa Thera (Mhv.xxiii.61), of Asubhakammika-Tissa and of his teacher Mahā-Tissa (MT.553).  The Vihāra was near Mahāgāma (MT.553).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Visuddhi Magga (p.292) mentions an Elder, Tissa, of Kota (Koti) pabbata, who, having attained arahantship through meditation on breathing, was able to limit the term of his life.  According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iv.50), an Elder named Anula lived in the monastery during the time of Dutthagāmanī, and the village Bhokkanta, residence of Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, was in its vicinity.  It was probably the same as Gotapabbata (q.v.) (See Mhv.xxxv.124; MT.667).  The Nāgalena was in the Kotapabbata-vihāra (DA.ii.695).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Koka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hunter.  While on his way to the forest with his dogs he meets a monk.  He bags no game that day and blames the monk, whom he again meets on his way home.  Koka sets his dogs on the monk, and when the latter climbs a tree, pierces the soles of his feet with arrows.  The monk's cloak falls upon the hunter, completely covering him.  The dogs, thinking that the monk has fallen from the tree, devour their own master.  The monk, fearing that he is to blame, seeks the Buddha, who reassures him and relates the story of a wicked physician who cajoled a boy into catching a snake, pretending that it was a bird.  When the boy discovered that it was a snake, he threw it on the physician's head, who died from its bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physician is identified with Koka.  DhA.iii.31f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past is evidently derived from the Sāliya Jātaka, which, however, according to the Jātaka Commentary, was related in reference, not to Koka, but to Devadatta.  (J.iii.202f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimsīla Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached by the Buddha in reply to a question put by Sāriputta beginning with the word kimsīla.  Sāriputta visited the Buddha, taking with him a young man, son of a friend of his father.  The youth had joined the Order under Sāriputta renouncing his immense wealth, but he could gain no attainment.  Sāriputta desired him to hear an exposition by the Buddha, hence his question (SnA.i.331).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One who aspires to the highest good should not be envious, obstinate, or careless, but diligent in his training, cultivating self-restraint and chastity, intent in the dhamma, making the dhamma his first and last concern (Sn.pp.56f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is the ninth of the Culla Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta, and derives its name from the first word (kimsilo) in Sāriputta's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

(SA.ii.188; UdA.307; DhA.iv.101; AA.i.246, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā Kaccāna')"&gt;Mahā Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; also lived there.  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokanadā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kokanadā.-Two daughters of Pajjunna, both called Kokanadā, though the younger was sometimes called Cūla-Kokanadā.  They visited the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and spoke verses in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  S.i.29f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokanadā.-One of the palaces of Siddhattha Buddha in his last lay life.  Bu.xvii.14; BuA.  (185) calls it Padumā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuntani Jātaka (No.343)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the court of the king of Benares was a heron who carried messages.  Once, when she was away, the boys of the palace killed her two young ones.  In revenge she persuaded a tiger to eat the boys, and told the king what she had done.  She then flew away to the Himālaya because, she said, there could be no friendship between the wrong-doer and the wronged one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a heron of the Kosala king, who acted in a similar way (J.iii.311f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotigāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in the vicinity of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya,Bhaddiyanagara')"&gt;Bhaddiyanagara&lt;/a&gt;.  The village was one gāvuta distant from the Ganges (MT.560).  The Buddha went there from Bhaddiyanagara.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th,Bhaddaji')"&gt;Bhaddaji&lt;/a&gt; preceded the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; to Kotigāma and awaited his arrival there.  The people, led by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanduttara,Nanduttara')"&gt;Nanduttara&lt;/a&gt;, made ready a meal and provided boats in which the Buddha and the monks might cross the river.  In the middle of the river, submerged in the water, stood the palace once occupied by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada,Mahāpanāda')"&gt;Mahāpanāda&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.332f; ThagA.i.287f; Mhv.xxxi.5f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his last tour the Buddha crossed the river at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaligāma')"&gt;Pātaligāma&lt;/a&gt;, went on to Kotigāma, and remained in that village preaching to the monks.  Hearing that the Buddha was there, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambapaalii,Ambapāli')"&gt;Ambapāli&lt;/a&gt; and hosts of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavis')"&gt;Licchavis&lt;/a&gt; came from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; to visit him, and Ambapāli gave him a meal.  From Kotigāma the Buddha went to Nādikā (Vin.i.230f; D.ii.90f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says (DA.ii.542; iii.856) that the village was so called because it was built near the dome (koti or thūpikā) of Mahāpanāda's palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikāya (v.431), Kotigāma was a village of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajjians')"&gt;Vajjians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khemankara &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khemankara Thera.-The constant attendant of Sikhī Buddha.  v.l.  Khemankura.  (D.ii.6; Bu.xxi.20; J.i.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemankara.-The king of Khema or Khemavatī, where the Buddha Kakusandha was born.  v.l.  Khemākara.  His purohita was Aggidatta, Kakusandha's father (Bu.xxii.13; BuA.209; Dvy.242).  He is sometimes also called Khema (MT.351; D.ii.7).&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosiya, Kosiyagotta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kosiya, Kosiyagotta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a brahmin clan.  In the Pācittiya it is given as one of the lower gottas.  (Vin.iv.8; but it is also Sakka's gotta, and is therefore generally regarded as a high one; see e.g., Thag.415; ThagA.i.452).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those mentioned as belonging to this gotta are the brahmin Kevatta (J.vi.418f), the brahmin who was the father of Sona Kumāra (the Bodhisatta) (J.v.319ff), Bhaddākāpilāni, born in Sāgala (AA.i.99; ThagA.68; SA ii.144), and the banker who came to be known as Macchariya-Kosiya (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kātiyāna's father was a Kosiyan, but he married a woman of the Kātiyāna family (ThagA.i.452).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543,Bhūridatta Jātaka')"&gt;Bhūridatta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.181; Mtu.ii.49) mentions a sage Kosiya, who taught Alambāyana the Nāga-spell.  The scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salikedara_jat484,Sālikedāra Jātaka')"&gt;Sālikedāra Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.278f) mentions a brahmin of Sālindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same reason.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosiya_jat_130_226_470,Kosiya Jātaka')"&gt;Kosiya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-brāhmanī.  All these are either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts.  The name Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka - once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), once by Mahā Moggallāna (M.i.252) - and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahā Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name means "belonging to the Kusika family." It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not known.  Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, 315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only the god of a Kusika clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means "Owl" and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of animals (cf.  Vaccha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Macchari-Kosiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant.  He belonged to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name.  He often listened to the preaching of Sāriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won arahant ship.  He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatī and in the time of Vipassī Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane.  (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ucchukandika of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.393.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Kosika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kosiya.&lt;/b&gt;-See Nanda Mānava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kurundī-Atthakathā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the great collections of commentaries on the Tipitaka used by Buddhaghosa in the compilation of his works.  Tradition says (See, e.g., Saddhamma-Sangaha, p.55) that it was written in Sinhalese, and was so called because it was compiled in the Kurundavelu-Vihāra in Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to have been chiefly concerned with Vinaya rules, for we find frequent references to it; particularly in the Samantapāsādikā.  E.g., Sp.i.281; ii.319; iii.537, 544, 545, 573, 583, 597, 616, 620, 626, 627, 660, 664, 668, 688, 722, 726; iv.745, 758, 778, 783, 789, 813, 818, 861, 920, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also called Kurundī-gandha (Gv.59).  In many cases its explanations appear to have been different from those of other commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korandaka Vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon.  The Visuddhi Magga (p.91) contains the story of a young monk, nephew of the Elder of the Vihāra, who went to Rohana for study; he later returned to the Vihāra, and for three months was waited on by his parents, but he did not reveal his identity, fearing that his parents would prove an impediment to him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This monastery was once the residence of an Elder named Mahā Sangharakkhita.  v.l.  Corakandaka.  MT.606.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kebukā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river.  It had to be crossed in order to reach the territory of the Garuda king who carried away the queen Kākātī (J.iii.91, 92).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast says it was beyond the Jambudīpasamudda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, in the Jātaka Commentary (J.vi.42), Kekuba is a name for water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotthita Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kotthita Sutta.-A conversation between Mahā Kotthita and Sāriputta as to whether or not anything exists after the passionless ending, without remainder, of the six spheres of contact (phassāyata nānam asesavirāganirodhā).  The conversation is repeated between Mahā Kotthita and Ananda.  A.ii.161f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kotthita Sutta.-Mahā Kotthita asks Sāriputta a series of questions as to why the holy life (brahmacariyā) is lived by the Blessed One, to all of which Sāriputta answers "No." He then goes on to explain that the purpose of the holy life is the realisation of the four Ariyan truths.  A.iv.382f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kotthita Sutta.-Three suttas.  Mahā Kotthita visits the Buddha and asks for a brief statement of the Dhamma.  The Buddha answers that desire should be put away for that which is (1) impermanent, (2) Ill, (3) without a self.  S.iv.145f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kotthita Sutta.-Kotthita visits Sāriputta at Isipatana and asks him which is true: to say that the eye is the bond of objects or that objects are the bond of the eye? Sāriputta replies that neither is true: the bond consists in the desire and lust arising from their contact.  If two men be yoked one to the other, the bond consists not in either of the men but in the yoke-tie which binds them.  If this were not so, the religious life would be purposeless.  S.iv.162f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Kotthita Sutta.-A group of three suttas containing conversations between Mahā Kotthita and Sāriputta on what constitutes ignorance.  S.iii.175.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusa Jātaka (No.531)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kusa (q.v.).  It was told in reference to a backsliding monk who fell in love with a woman in Sāvatthi, neglected all his duties and refused food.  He was taken to the Buddha, who related this story to show how even mighty men may lose their power and come to misery through love of a woman.  (J.v.278ff; the story is also given in Mtu.iii.1ff; ii.441f; the details differ, as do some of the names, from the Pāli version).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story bears much resemblance to that of Anitthigandha (q.v.).  See also Sammillabhāsinī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kosala Sutta.-While Pasenadi is visiting the Buddha, a messenger arrives and announces the death of Mallikā.  The king is greatly grieved, but the Buddha consoles him by pointing out how it is impossible to escape old age, decay, disease, destruction.  A.iii.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kosala Sutta.-Everything changes, even Pasenadi, king of Kāsi-Kosala, the whole universe, even Mahā Brahmā and the devas of the Abhassara world.  Instability and change are everywhere; therefore the wise loathe all, having a mind only to attain in this life the anupadāparinibbāna (A.v.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kosala Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the Buddha at Jetavana after having won a battle, and, falling at the Buddha's feet, shows great humility and does obeisance.  When the Buddha asks the reason for such profound homage, the king gives various reasons for his honouring of the Buddha (A.v.65ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khemaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khemaka.-A Sākyan of Kapilavatthu, father of Abhirūpa-Nandā.  See also Kāla-Khemaka.  ThigA.25; Ap.ii.608.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemaka Thera.-An arahant.  Once, when he lay very ill at the Badarikārāmā, near Kosambī, some monks, staying at the Ghositārāma, sent one of their number, Dāsaka, with a message to Khemaka, inquiring whether he managed to bear his pains.  Dāsaka returned with the reply that he did not; he was sent again to ask if Khemaka had seen the self in the five khandhas; when Dāsaka returned with the answer that he had not, be was sent a third time to ask whether Khemaka was an arahant.  "No," came the answer, and Dāsaka had to visit him a fourth time with the inquiry, What did Khemaka mean by self? In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositārāma and explained how, even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still clings to him a subtle remnant of the "I" conceit.  It is said that as a result of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants (S.iii.126ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.ii.230f) explains that the monks wished to hear Khemaka because they knew his ability, and they also knew that if they showed keenness to learn he would come to them.  They did not go to him because his but was small, and they did not actually ask him to come to them because he was ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khemaka, Khema, Khemanesāda.-The name given to the fowler who caught the golden swan from Cittakūta, at the request of King Seyya (v.l.  Samyama), as narrated in the Mahāhamsa Jātaka (q.v.).  Khemaka received his name from the lake Khema, of which he was in charge.  He is identified with Channa (J.v.356ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Khemaka.-See Khemavatī.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimbilā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town on the banks of the Ganges.  It was in a veluvana (more probably a niceluvana; the Anguttara Commentary ii.642 explains it as a Mucalindavana) there the Buddha stayed and where the Kimbila and Kimbilā Suttas were preached (A.iii.247, etc.; S.iv.181f; v.322).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), it was the birthplace of the setthiputta Kimbila (Kimbila 2).  The city existed in the time of Kassapa Buddha and was the residence of the woman who later became Kannamundapetī (Pv.12; PvA.151).  Among the palaces seen by Nimi when he visited heaven was that of a deva who had been a very pious man of Kimbilā (J.vi.121).  Another such pious person of the same city was Rohaka with his wife Bhadditthikā.  Vv.xxii.4; VvA.109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitāgiri Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kitāgiri to the Assajipunabbasukā, who were reported to the Buddha as having ridiculed the idea that they should themselves have only one meal a day because the Buddha and his devoted disciples did so.  The Buddha sent for them and impressed on them that all his teachings were based on experience and knowledge and should therefore be followed by them.  Chaffering such as their's was not seemly in the seeker after truth (M.i.473ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kittinissanka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;also known as Nissanka Malla, king of Ceylon (1187-1196 A.C.).  He was uparāja of Vijayabāhu II., and became king after the murder of Mahinda VI.  Among his acts of piety were the building of a stone temple for the Tooth Relic at Pulatthipura and the embellishment of the famous rock-temple at Jambukola-vihāra.  His son was Virabāhu.  For other details see Cv.lxxx.30ff; also Cv.Trs.ii.127, n.1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimbila, Kimila, Kimmila-Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sākiyan of Kapilavatthu.  He was converted with Bhaddiya and four other Sākyan nobles at Anupiyā, shortly after the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu (Vin.ii.182; DhA.i.112f).  The Theragāthā Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiyā the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing into old age.  Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship.  Kimbila seems to have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that.  The Buddha visited them at Pācīna-vamsadāya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant monks of Kosambī.  (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff and ThagA.i.275f).  They were in the Gosingasālavana when the Buddha preached to them the Cūla-Gosinga Sutta, at the conclusion of which, Dīgha Parajana Yakkha sang the praises of all three (M.i.205ff).  Their number was increased by the presence of Bhagu, Kundadhāna, Revata and Ananda, on the occasion when the Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta in the Palāsavana at Nalakapāna (M.i.462ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three different places in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made to endure long after the Buddha's death and what were the causes which might bring about its early disappearance.  The conversation took place in the Veluvana (Niceluvana?) in Kimbilā.  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the Sākyan but another.  We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbilā.  He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births.  He recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse.  It was this memory of his previous life which prompted Kimbila's question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing.  Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times.  Ananda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha's death he erected a pavilion of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235).  He is probably to be identified with Salalamandapiya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.115; iv.126) mentions a story which shows how delicately nurtured Kimbila was.  One day, in a discussion with his friends, Anuruddha and Bhaddiya, as to where rice came from, Kimbila remarked that it came from the granary (kotthe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kimbila.&lt;/b&gt;-A setthiputta of Kimbilā who later became a monk.  See Kimbila (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kurangavī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of the king of Benares.  She fell in love with Elakamāra (q.v.) and was ultimately married to him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She misconducted herself with Chalangakumāra and his attendant Dhanantevāsī (J.v.429f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kurangavī forms one of the tales related by Kunāla.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korandapupphiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant.  Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the footprint of the Buddha Vipassī and offered to it a koranda-plant in bloom.  Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Vītamala (Ap.i.206).  He is probably to be identified with Ramanīyavihārī.  ThagA.i.116.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Korandapupphiya Thera.-An arahant.  He was a woodsman in the time of Tissa Buddha, and having seen three footprints of the Buddha, he offered to him a flowering koranda-plant.  In all subsequent births his skin was the colour of the koranda-flower.  The same verses appear in two places in the Apadāna with very slight variations (Ap.ii.383, 434).  Perhaps these are two distinct persons, because in the Theragāthā Commentary the verses appear twice - once under the name of Sugandha (ThagA.i.81) and once under that of Sabbamitta (ThagA.i.270).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kulumba Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discourse, evidently well known, but not included in the Three Rescensions (tisso sañgīti) (Sp.iv.742, 743).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atthasālinī (DhSA.91) gives an extract from it and refers "to an infanticide of Kulumba." The quotation is to show that a bodily action may arise also in the mind-door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkura Jātaka (No 22)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kukkura Jātaka (No 22).-Because his carriage straps, left in the rain, are gnawed by his own dogs, the king of Benares orders all dogs except his own to be killed indiscriminately.  The Bodhisatta, who is the leader of the pack of dogs in the cemetery, visits the king, points out to him his iniquity, and reveals the truth by causing an emetic to be administered to the king's dogs.  Having convinced the king, the Bodhisatta teaches him the ten stanzas of Righteousness found in the Tesakuna Jātaka (dhammañ cara mahārāja, etc.) (J.v.123).  Great are the benefactions made to dogs thereafter.  The Bodhisatta's teaching lasted for ten thousand years under the name of Kukkurovāda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda (J.i.175ff).  The occasion for the story is given in the Bhaddasāla Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kukkura Jātaka.-See Kakkara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Komāyaputta Jātaka (No.299)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some ascetics in Himavā failed to take their duties seriously and spent their time in eating and making merry.  They had a monkey who provided them with amusement.  One day when the ascetics went to the plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin ascetic named Komāyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics.  The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told at the Pubbārāma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.  At the Buddha's request, Moggallāna made their house shake in order to frighten them.  J.ii.447f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumudadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In Padumuttara's time he was a bird named Kakudha in a lake in Himavā and offered the Buddha a lotus-flower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen hundred kappas ago he became king eight times under the name of Varuna (Ap.i.180).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Malitavambha.  ThagA.i.211f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotamalaya (? more probably Kotthamalaya)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountainous region in South Ceylon, whither Dutthagāmanī fled from his father's wrath, and where he lived while making preparations for his campaign (Mhv.xxiv.7; xxxii.29; MT.332, 430).  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokanuda (Kokanada)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paribbājaka.  He meets Ananda on the banks of the Tapodā, where they are both bathing, and enters into conversation with him.  Kokanuda asks Ananda a series of questions, such as whether the world is eternal, whether the Tathāgata lives after death, etc., all of which, Ananda says, are impossible to answer, not because he himself does not know these things, but because he does know them.  Finally, Kokanuda asks Ananda who he is, and, on learning his identity, asks his pardon for his questions which he had asked in all ignorance.  A.v.196f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesakambala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the hair blanket is reckoned the meanest and lowest of all woven garments, even so, of all theories advanced by recluses, that of Makkhali is the meanest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makkhali proclaims that there is no doing of a deed, there is nothing done and no energy to do.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandahāla Jātaka (No.542)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khandahāla was the chaplain of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekaraaja,Ekarājā')"&gt;Ekarājā&lt;/a&gt; of Pupphavatī.  The chaplain took bribes, and the king's son, Candakumāra, having been told of this, once righted a wrong decision, thereby winning the applause of the people.  The king appointed him judge, and Khandahāla vowed vengeance.  Later the king, having dreamed of heaven, asked Khandahāla the way thither; the chaplain replied that the way lay through a sacrifice in which all the king's sons, his queens, his merchant princes, and his most treasured possessions should be offered.  Khandahāla hoped thereby to bring about the death of Candakumāra.  Ekarājā accepted the suggestion and made all preparations for the sacrifice.  Several times the king wavered in his resolve, being interceded with by his parents, Canda and his wives, and the people.  Khandahāla goaded him on, but at the moment when the sword was about to descend on the neck of Candakumāra, the latter's wife, Candā, daughter of the Pañcāla king, made an "act of truth," and Sakka appeared, brandishing a thunderbolt.  Canda was saved, the crowd killed Khandahāla, and would have killed the king too but for the intervention of Sakka.  The king was made an outcast and banished from the city, and Candakumāra, now the crowned king, supplied all his wants.  (J.vi.129-57; the story is also found in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cariyaapitaka,Cariyāpitaka')"&gt;Cariyāpitaka&lt;/a&gt; as the Candakumāra-cariyā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khandahāla is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, Candā with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rahulamata,Rāhulamātā')"&gt;Rāhulamātā&lt;/a&gt;, and Candakumāra with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's attempts to kill the Buddha by engaging the services of archers to shoot him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is referred to as an example of a husband being saved by the virtue of his wife (J.iv.47), and also of one instance of Devadatta having greater power than the Bodhisatta (Mil.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka is sometimes called the Candakumāra Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khata Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khata Sutta.-A man who praises and blames without scrutiny, who shows appreciation or displeasure without testing the object thereof - such a one carries with him an uprooted, lifeless self.  Not so the man who has the opposite qualities.  A.ii.2f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khata Sutta.-A man guilty of wrong conduct towards mother, father, the Tathāgata or a Tathāgata's followers is possessed of an uprooted, lifeless self.  A.ii.4f.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kunāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kunāla.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the seven great lakes in the region of the Himālaya.  The Buddha once visited it with a large concourse of Sākiyan youths who had joined the Order, and on that occasion he preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536,Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.415; MA.ii.692, 1021; AA.ii.759, etc.).  The sun's rays never reached the waters of the lake, which were therefore never warm (SnA.ii.407).  According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.358; DA.ii.675), the Kunāla Jātaka was actually preached on the banks of the Kunāladaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kunāla.&lt;/b&gt;-The Bodhisatta, born as the king of the Citrakokilas.  He lived in a beautiful forest in the Himālaya, attended by three thousand five hundred hen birds.  He was carried about on a stick by two birds while in front, behind, above and below flew his vast retinue, guarding him from all harm and providing for all his needs.  He distrusted and despised all womankind, and his stories of their wiles, as related by him to his friend &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnamukha,Punnamukha')"&gt;Punnamukha&lt;/a&gt;, are given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536,Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

They had numerous followers and, after death, were born in the Brahma-world (A.iii.371, 373; iv.135).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kuddāla-birth was one in which the perfection of paññā was developed (J.i.46).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kodhana Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kodhana Sutta.-A woman who is wrathful is reborn in purgatory.  S.iv.240.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutūhalasālā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vacchagotta asks the Buddha how his teaching on the subject of rebirth differs from that of other teachers; for example, of Pūrana Kassapa.  The Buddha explains that, according to his own teaching, rebirth comes only to a being who has fuel, the fuel being craving (S.iv.398f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion arises out of a conversation which, according to Vacchagotta, took place among paribbājakas in the Kutūhalasālā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.369; MA.ii.694) that there was no special place of that name; any place where discussions were held could be so called.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutelitissamahā-vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon.  It was once the residence of a Sāmanera of great iddhi-power who later lost all these powers as a result of falling in love with a weaver's daughter of Kabupelanda (VibhA.293; but see MA.ii.700).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may perhaps be the same as the Kūtāli-vihāra (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kevatta (v.l.  Kevaddha) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached in the Pārāvārika-ambavana in Nālandā.  Kevatta (1) visits the Buddha and asks him to order a monk to perform some mystic wonder in order to increase the faith of the Buddha's followers.  The Buddha expresses his hatred of miracles and tells Kevatta that a greater and better wonder than any or all of them is education in the system of self-training which culminates in Arahantship.  In illustration of this, he relates a legend: A monk, seeking the answer to the question "Where do the elements pass away?" goes up and up, by the power of his iddhi, from world to world, asking the gods for an answer.  In each heaven he is referred to those who are higher up, until he comes at last to the Great Brahmā himself, who takes him aside and tells him that he does not know the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monk seeks the Buddha, who explains to him that the question is wrongly put; it should be, "Where do the elements find no foothold; where do nāma and rūpa pass away?" And the answer is, "In the mind of the arahant, when intellect (viññāna) ceases, then nāma and rūpa cease." D.i.211ff; cp.  Ud.i.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Savittha asks Nārada the same questions at the latter's own request and receives the same answers; but Nārada declares that he is not an arahant.  Ananda is also present and joins in the discussion.

When the Buddha found that he could not induce the monks to live in harmony, he related to them the story of Dīghīti, king of Kosala, and when even that failed to produce the desired effect he uttered ten stanzas, standing poised in mid-air, and went away from Kosambī, leaving the monks to their fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kosambī Jātaka contains only a small portion of the story of Dīghīti, scarcely more than an allusion to it.  The Dīghīti Kosala Jātaka (q.v.) contains further details, but even when taken together, these two do not make the story complete.  The full story is related in the Vinaya Pitaka (Vin.i.342ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuhaka Jātaka (No.89)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a country squire, having great faith in the holiness of a matted-haired ascetic, buried some of his wealth in the hermitage he himself had provided for the ascetic.  The latter, coveting the gold, hid it elsewhere, and took leave of the squire as though he were going to some other part of the country.  The squire, after pressing him in vain to stay, accompanied him part of the way.  Suddenly the ascetic stopped and said he had found a straw from the roof of the hermitage sticking to his hair and wished to restore it as it did not belong to him.  The squire was greatly impressed by this show of non-covetousness, but another ascetic, who was the Bodhisatta, observing what happened and guessing the reason, communicated his suspicions to the squire.  When they searched for the gold it could not be found, but the ascetic confessed his guilt after a sound thrashing (J.i.375ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occasion for the telling of the story is given in the Uddāla Jātaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumārapañha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth chapter of the Khuddaka-Pātha (Khp.2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It consists of ten questions which, according to the Commentaries (KhpA.76; ThagA.i.479), the Buddha asked the young Sopāka, then an arahant though only seven years old, with the idea of giving him the upasampadā-ordination.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy-arahant answered the questions and this conversation formed his ordination.  (See also Thag.v.485; Ap.i.64f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions were elaborated by the nun of Kajangalā (see A.v.54ff).  (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.636) on the Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta seems to indicate a set of questions called Kumārapañha in connection with Rāhula when he was seven years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also SA.iii.99, where Buddhaghosa says that Cittagahapati, in a discussion with Nigantha Nātaputta, referred to the Kumārapañha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khomadussa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A (brahmin?) township in the Sākyan country.  The Buddha once stayed there and preached to an assembly of brahmin householders.  It is said that the brahmins were at first hostile to the Buddha, but that he won them over (S.i.184).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village was so called because of the preponderance (ussannatā) of khomadussā (linen cloth).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambī Jātaka (No.428)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory story relates how the monks of Kosambī quarrelled and brought about great dissension among themselves because one of their number had left in a vessel the surplus water for rinsing the mouth.  When the Buddha found that he could not induce the monks to live in harmony, he related to them the story of Dīghīti, king of Kosala, and when even that failed to produce the desired effect he uttered ten stanzas, standing poised in mid-air, and went away from Kosambī, leaving the monks to their fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kosambī Jātaka contains only a small portion of the story of Dīghīti, scarcely more than an allusion to it.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumbhīra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha who lived in the Vepulla mountain outside Rājagaha.  He was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta with a train of over one hundred thousand (D.ii.257).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is called Rājagahika because he was born in Rājagaha (DA.ii.686).  Sometimes (E.g., J.vi.272) he is spoken of as chief of the Kumbhandas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bimbisāra wished to visit the courtesan Padumavatī at Ujjeni, the chaplain enlisted Kumbhīra's assistance in transporting the king thither (ThigA.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Koliyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha.  The Koliyā owned two chief settlements - one at Rāmagāma and the other at Devadaha.  The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas.  We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest.  There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy.  Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons.  With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so.  The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā.  The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kunālā Jātaka (J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once "lived like animals in a Kola-tree," as their name signified.  The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī.  The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha.  (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262).  A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha.  In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.  (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā).  They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uttara, the residence of the headman Pātaliya (S.iv.340); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sajjanela, residence of Suppavāsā (A.ii.62); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sāpūga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kakkarapatta, where lived Dīghajānu (A.iv.281); and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) (attendant of Moggallāna), and Kankhā-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death the Koliyans of Rāmagāma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha's relics, over which they erected a thūpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff).  See also s.v.  Suppavāsā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kelisīla Jātaka (No.202)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta, king of Benares, could not look upon anyone old or decrepit without playing jokes on them.  He made old men roll about on the ground and played practical jokes on old women.  His friends behaved likewise.  All old people left his country; no parents or aged persons remained to be tended by the young, and newcomers among the gods were few in number.  Sakka (the Bodhisatta), wishing to teach the king a lesson, once appeared before him in the guise of an old man, with two jars of butter milk in a crazy old cart, having willed that only the king should be able to see him.  The king was riding his state elephant, and when he asked the old tarter to move the latter dashed the two jars on the king's head and the onlookers laughed to see the milk dripping down his face.  Resuming Sakka's form, the Bodhisatta admonished the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to account for Lakuntaka Bhaddiya's deformity.  J.ii.142-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keniya &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Keniya (v.l.  Kenniya).&lt;/b&gt;-A Jatila.  He lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aapana,Āpana')"&gt;Āpana&lt;/a&gt;, and when the Buddha once stayed there with one thousand three hundred and fifty monks, Keniya visited the Buddha, bringing various kinds of drinks, which he gave to him and to the monks.  The following day he invited the whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality.  It was as a result of the drinks offered by Keniya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks were permissible for monks and which were not (Vin.i.245f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Sutta Nipāta (p.104; M.ii.146f; see also ThagA.ii.47), it was owing to the elaborate preparations made by Keniya for the meal to the Buddha and the Sangha that the brahmin Sela, friend and counsellor of Keniya, came to discover the Buddha's presence in Āpana.  The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.440; MA.ii.779; Ap.i.318) that Keniya was a mahāsāla-brahmin, and that he became a Jatila with the object of protecting his wealth.  He bought some land from the king and built his hermitage there, and became the protector (nissaya) of one thousand families.  In his hermitage was a palm tree which yielded a golden nut each day.  Keniya was a yellow-robed ascetic by day; by night he enjoyed the pleasures of the senses.  On his first visit to the Buddha he took five hundred pingo-loads of badarapāna (SNA.ii.446) (? grape juice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keniya is mentioned (E.g., DA.i.270; see also DhA.i.323; UdA.241) as an example of one of the eight classes of ascetics - those who maintain wife and children (sa-puttabhariya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Keniya.&lt;/b&gt;-In the Apadāna (ii.469, v.16) Mahā Kappina is mentioned as having belonged to the Keniya-jāti.  Perhaps this is a wrong reading; the corresponding verse in ThagA.i.510 gives Koliya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kittaggabodhi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kittaggabodhi.-Nephew of Dappula II.  He married Devā, King Dappula's daughter, and leaving his brother, who was also called Dappula, will, the king, went to Rohana, and having subdued that, country, became king there (Cv.xlix.71).  He had four sons - Mahinda, Kassapa, Sena and Udaya - and three daughters - Sanghā, Tissā and Kitti (Cv.l.50ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kittaggabodhi.-Ādipāda and son of Mahinda, uparāja to Sena II and Kitti.  He rebelled against Udaya II.  and fled to Rohana, whose ruler he killed.  He was taken captive by Prince Mahinda, son of Kassapa, the yuvarāja of Udaya II, with the help of the general Vajiragga, in Malaya, and was probably killed by the latter at Guttasāla.  Cv.li.94ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khitaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khitaka Thera.-An arahant.  He was born in a brahmin family in Sāvatthi, and having heard of the supernormal powers of Mahā Moggallāna entered the Order, wishing to attain to a like proficiency.  He developed sixfold abhiññā and great supernormal powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a yakkha chief, and when he saw the Buddha and greeted him, the Buddha, to his great joy, preached to him.  Eighty kappas ago he became king under the name of Sumangala (Thag.v.104; ThagA.i.209f).  He is probably identical with Supāricariya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khitaka Thera.-An arahant.  He was born in a brahmin family of Kosala and, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, in due course winning arahantship.  Later he dwelt in the forest, stirring enthusiasm in the forest-dwelling monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a park-keeper, and having seen the Buddha going through the air offered him a coconut fruit, which the Buddha stopped to accept (Thag.vv.191-2; ThagA.315f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Nālikeradāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.447f).  His Apadāna verses are also found under the name of Kundala Thera.  ThagA.i.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kirapatika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A household of Vesalī, a pious follower of the Buddha.  Once when the Buddha was staying in Vesalī, a poor man, wishing to give alms to him and to the monks, asked Kirapatika for money to provide the alms; Kirapatika gladly gave him much money and the Buddha and the monks were invited.  But the monks, having heard of the man's poverty, had a full meal earlier, so that when the man served them with the food he had prepared they could eat but very little.  The man was greatly offended and the Buddha, hearing of it, made an order to the monks prohibiting such conduct (Vin.iv.75f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iv.817) that the householder's name was Kira, but that he was called Kirapatika on account of his great influence.  He gave his workmen regular and generous wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuvannā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkha maiden, whom Vijaya married on his arrival in Ceylon.  With her assistance he killed the Yakkhas at their feast in Sirīsivatthu.  Later Vijaya discarded her in favour of a royal maiden from Madhurā, and she left, with her two children Jīvahattha and Dipellā, for Lankāpura, where she was slain as a spy.  Her children fled to Malaya and their descendants became the Pulindas (Mhv.vii.9-68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuvannā had as companion a slave called Sisapātī (Sīsapātikā).  v.l.  Kuvenī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MT.255.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkutavatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some accounts the city, where Mahā Kappina ruled before he became a monk, is called, not Kukkuta (q.v.), but Kukkutavatī.  Perhaps the former was the name of the county and the latter that of its capital.  From here to Sāvatthi was a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and there was a trade route between the two cities which merchants travelled on foot (janghavānijā), and also a route from the Majjhimadesa.  Three rivers had to be crossed on the way: the Aravacchā, the Nīlavāhanā and the Candabhāgā.  DhA.ii.116ff; a less detailed account is given in SA.ii.177f and AA.i.175f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korabya, Koravya, Korabba&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurūs (cf.  Brahmadatta).  Once in the Jātakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457).  Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs.  Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavāsika (E.g., J.vi.273).  The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361).  The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha.  According to the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapāla), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarājā, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migācīra (q.v.).  This king was evidently interested in religious discussion.  Thullakotthika was his capital.  The Avadānasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb.  Hist.  of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcāla king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; vi.236).  In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.  (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f).  Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha's Parinibbāna (D.ii.146,169).  It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; from the south and the west.  (See, e.g., Vin.i.277).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was thirty leagues by river from Benares.  (Thus we are told that the fish which swallowed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula,Bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt; travelled thirty leagues through the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa,Yamunā')"&gt;Yamunā&lt;/a&gt;, from Kosambī to Benares, AA.i.170; PsA.491).  The usual route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; to Kosambī was up the river (this was the route taken by Ananda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, Vin.ii.290), though there seems to have been a land route passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anupiya,Anupiya')"&gt;Anupiya&lt;/a&gt; and Kosambī to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  (See Vin.ii.184f).  In the Sutta Nipāta (vv.1010-13) the whole route is given from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati,Mahissati')"&gt;Mahissati&lt;/a&gt; to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthi, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena's park, the Udakavana, where Ananda and Pindola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena's palace on two different occasions (Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; J.iv.375).  The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapāvana in Kosambī (S.v.437).  Mahā Kaccāna lived in a woodland near Kosambī after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī - the Kukkutārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambī, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pāvārika), and the Badarikārāma.  The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.  (Thomas, op.  cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambī, holding that these stories are of later invention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambī, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammāssadamma and was offered in marriage Māgandiyā, daughter of the brahmin Māgandiya.  The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Māgandiya Sutta.  Māgandiyā took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sāmavatī, who had been the Buddha's follower.  (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambī.  Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed.  The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong.  The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged.  The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace.  The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference.  In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakalonakāragāma and the Pācīnavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest.  In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute.  (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.  But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambī.  The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambī to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kāsī, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l.  Kusumbha).  Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhā) grew in great numbers in and around the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambī.  (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170).  In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambī a powerful Nāga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain.  The Nāga was converted by Sāgata, who thereby won great fame.  (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatikā).  Rujā was born in a banker's family in Kosambī (J.vi.237f).  Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392).  A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambī is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamunā) as being "Gangāya nadiyā tīre." This is either an error, or here the name Gangā refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamunī.  Kosambī is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad.  (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimikālā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river near Jantugāma.  Meghiya Thera was attracted by a mango-grove on its banks and asked the Buddha's permission to meditate there.  Twice the Buddha refused; the third time he gave his permission.  Meghiya went, but soon returned, finding that he could not concentrate his mind there.  The river was evidently in the neighbourhood of Cālikā (A.iv.354f; ThagA.i.149; Ud.iv.1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Udāna Commentary (UdA.217), it was so called because it abounded in black worms (kālakimīnam bahulatāya).v.l.  Kipillikā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesava Jātaka (No.346)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ascetic Kesava lived in Himavā with five hundred pupils.  The Bodhisatta, having been born as Kappa, a brahmin of Kāsī, joined him and became his senior pupil.  When the ascetics went to Benares for salt and vinegar, the king lodged them in his park and fed them, and when they returned to Himavā, persuaded Kesava to stay behind.  Kesava fell ill of loneliness, and the five physicians of the king could not cure him.  At his own request he was taken to the Himālaya by the king's minister, Nārada, and there, on seeing again his familiar haunts and his pupil Kappa, he immediately recovered, though his medicine was but the broth of wild rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king of the Jātaka is Ananda, Nārada is Sāriputta, and Kesava, Baka Brahmā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Pasenadi.  Having discovered that Anāthapindika daily fed five hundred monks in his house, the king gave orders that the same should be done in his palace.  One day he discovered that the monks would take the food from the palace, but would eat that which was given to them elsewhere by those who served them because they loved them.  When the king reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha pointed out to him that the best food was that which was given in love; love was the best flavouring for food (J.iii.142-5; iii.362; S.i.144; SA.i.165).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.342ff), the king personally looked after the monks for seven days, after which he forgot about them and they were uncared for.  Thereupon they omitted to go to the palace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past as given in this Commentary differs considerably from the Jātaka-version.  Here Kesava is described as a king who had left the world and become an ascetic.  The ascetics left the royal park, disliking the noise there, but they left Kappa with Kesava.  Soon after, Kappa went away, and it was then that Kesava fell ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesava is identified with the Bodhisatta, Kappa with Ananda, the king of Benares with Moggallāna, and Nārada with Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this reluctance of the Sākyan monks to accept Pasenadi's hospitality which led him to seek marriage with a Sākyan maiden; but the Sākyans gave him Vāsabhakhattiyā (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Savittha asks Nārada the same questions at the latter's own request and receives the same answers; but Nārada declares that he is not an arahant.  Ananda is also present and joins in the discussion.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitavāsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Benares.  A son was born to him who was named Dutthakumāra, and who, according to the fortune-tellers, would die for lack of water.  In order to falsify the prophecy, the king guarded his son closely, made numerous tanks near the city, and saw that vessels of water were placed wherever possible.  One day, while returning from the park, the prince saw a Pacceka Buddha, and being angry that obeisance should be paid to the Buddha instead of to himself, he took the Buddha's bowl and dashed it on the ground.  The prince's body burst into flames, but all the water around having dried up, they could not be quenched and he was swallowed up in hell.  When Kitavāsa heard of this he was greatly grieved, but on reflection he realised that his grief sprang from affection, and thenceforth resolved to fix his love on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitavāsa is identified with Chattapāni of the Dhammaddhaja Jātaka, Chattapāni himself being a former birth of Sāriputta (J.ii.194ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kitavāsa's son bears close resemblance to that of Kitava's son (see Kundinagariya Thera).  Perhaps Kitava and Kitavāsa are identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kunāla Jātaka (No.536)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kunāla, king of the Citrakokilas, though well served by his hen birds, always despised them and found fault with them.  The king of the Phussakokilas, Punnamukha, on the other hand, always sang the praises of his escort.  One day the two kings met, and Punnamukha asked Kunāla why he was not more gracious to his ladies.  "Because I know too much about women," was the answer; but Punnamakha was not in a mood to discuss the matter any more.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Punnamukha fell ill, and his hen birds deserted him and came to Kunāla.  He drove them away, ministered to Punnamukha, and cheered him.  Some time after, Kunāla, seated on the Manosilātala in Himavā (according to Buddhaghosa, D.ii.675, this was on the banks of the Kunāladaha), started to tell his friend of the wickedness of women.  Hearing of this, many inhabitants of numerous worlds came to listen to him, among them Ananda, king of the vultures, and the ascetic Nārada.  Many were the instances given by Kunāla to illustrate the deceitfulness, ingratitude and immorality of women - among them the stories of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhaa,Kanhā')"&gt;Kanhā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccatapāvī&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaakaatii_jat_327,Kākātī')"&gt;Kākātī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurangavii,Kurangavī')"&gt;Kurangavī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiyani,Pingiyānī')"&gt;Pingiyānī&lt;/a&gt;, Brahmadatta's mother who sinned with Pañcālacanda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the queen Kinnarā&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancapapa,Pañcapāpā')"&gt;Pañcapāpā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kunāla's diatribe was followed by Ananda's, and his by Nārada's, each claiming to speak from facts within their knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the stories related by Kunāla, the bird-king is identified with one of the characters concerned in each story, so that he was able to speak with authority.  Thus he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajjuna, one of Kanha's husbands; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the goldsmith in the story of Saccatapāvī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Garuda in Kākātī's tale; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chalangakumāra, who misconducted himself with Kurangavī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcālacanda, lover of Brahmadatta's mother; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the chaplain, also called Pañcālacanda, who saved Kinnarā from her husband's wrath; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka, one time husband of Pañcapāpā; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Brahmadatta, husband of Pingiyānī.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punnamukha is identified with Udāyī, the vulture-king with Ananda and Nārada with Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Kunāla Jātaka was followed by that of the Mahāsamaya Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Jātaka was related in order to destroy the discontent that rose in the hearts of the Sākiyan youths, kinsmen of the Buddha, who, having entered the Order, were troubled by the thought of the wives they had left behind.  The Buddha therefore took them to the Himalaya, showed them the magnificent beauty of the region, particularly the miraculous splendours of the Kunāladaha, and there preached to them.  At the end of the Jātaka they all became arahants.  We are told that that very day they became arahants (J.v.412-56; also DA.ii.674ff; AA.i.173).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_kunaala_jat_464,Cūla Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Cūla Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country inhabited by the Kosalā, to the north-west of Magadha and next to Kāsī.  It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mahājanapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.).  In the Buddha's time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Vidūdabha.  By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find that when Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, married Kosaladevī, daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi, a village in Kāsī was given as part of the dowry (J.ii.237; iv.342f).  Various Jātakas indicate that the struggle between Kāsi and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425).  Sometimes the Kāsi king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country.  At others the Kosala king would invade Kāsi and annex it to his own territory.  Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), Dīghāvu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of "Bāranāsiggāha," (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of Kāsi.  Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., Dīghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116).  Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407).  With the capture of Kāsi the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable.  Bimbisāra's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day.  Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants.  Once Ajātasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajirā, in marriage and for a time all went well.  Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Ajātasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala.  (See Vincent Smith, op.  cit., 32f).  In the sixth century B.C.  the Sākyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala.  The Sutta Nipāta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala.  Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, "Bhagavā pi Kosalako, aham pi Kosalako."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthi was the capital of Kosala.  Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348).  There was also Ayojjhā, on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the Rāmāyana, must once have been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C.  it was quite unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravatī (D.i.235) and the Sundarikā (S.i.167; SN.  p.97; but see M.i.39, where the river is called Bāhukā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among localities spoken of as being in Kosala are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icchānangala (A.iii.30, 341; iv.340, etc.), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukkatthā (D.i.87), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekasālā (S.i.111), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opasāda (M.ii.164), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesaputta of the Kālāmas (A.i.188), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candalakappa (M.ii.209), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toranavatthu (S.iv.374), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dandakappa (A.iii.402), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagaravinda (M.iii.290), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nalakapāna (A.v.122; M.i.462), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nālandā (S.iv.322), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pankadhā (A.i.236), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venāgapura (A.i.180), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veludvāra (S.v.352), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sālā (M.i.285, 400; S.v.227), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sālāvatika (D.i.244), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setavya (D.ii.316).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mtu.  adds Dronavastuka (iii.377) and Mārakaranda (i.317).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.400f; DA.i.239f) give a curious explanation of the name Kosalā.  It is said that when nothing could make Mahāpanāda smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone who could succeed in doing this.  People, accordingly, left their work and flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor that Mahāpanāda showed any signs of being amused.  When this happened the men returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their friends, they asked of each other, "Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam." The district where this occurred came to be called Kosalā on account of the repetition of the word kusala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in Sāvatthi or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala.  (See Vinaya Index, s.v.  Kosala).  It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown.  Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226).  Bāvarī himself was a native of Kosala (SN.v.976), yet he preferred to have his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, his unnaloma was deposited in a thūpa in Kosala (Bu.xxviii.9).  It is said that the measures used in Kosala were larger than those of Magadha - thus one Kosala pattha was equal to four Magadha patthas (SNA.ii.476).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosala is often mentioned in combination with Kāsi in the compound Kāsi-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kāsi-Kosala (e.g., A.v.59) (cf.  Ariga-Magadha).  See also Pasenadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kosala&lt;/b&gt;.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of names.  M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kontimārā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river which flowed from the hill Ārañjara.  Alongside this river ran the road taken by men who were banished by the people of Sibi; the road was also taken by Vessantara on his way to exile (J.vi.493).  The river is five leagues from Suvannagiritāla and five from Ārañjara.  J.vi.514.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kujjatissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He lived in Mangana in Ceylon, and was mentioned by the Sangha to King Saddhātissa as being worthy of his special worship.  The king travelled five leagues to see him, but the thera, lest the king should invite him to the palace, lay down on a bed at the time of the king's arrival and started scratching letters on the floor.  The king decided that the thera was not an arahant and went away.  When he was blamed for having displeased so pious a king, the thera undertook to make amends.  He requested that, after his death, he should be placed in a covered palanquin containing also a second bed.  This was done and the palanquin travelled by air to Anurādhapura, performing many miracles, applauded by the people.  In Anurādhapura it circled round the Thūpārāma and the Silācetiya and, when it reached the Lohapāsāda, the thera Mahāvyaggha entered the palanquin, lay down on the spare bed and entered Nibbāna.  The king made offerings of flowers and perfumes to the palanquin and it descended to earth, for such had been Kujjatissa's desire.  The bodies were burnt and thūpas were erected over the relics.  AA.i.384f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Khuddaka-Tissa (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kharadāthika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha.  The Bodhisatta, who became Mangala Buddha in one of his later births, left his kingdom and lived as a recluse in the forest with his wife and children.  The yakkha, having heard of the Bodhisatta's generosity, came to him, begged for his two children, and on being given them ate them in the sight of their father.  Even when the blood flowed from the yakkha's mouth the Bodhisatta remained unmoved, and wished that in the future there should issue from his own body rays of light, in colour like to streams of blood.  As a result of this wish Mangala's aura always spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of other Buddhas spread as a rule only one fathom from their body.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country inhabited by the Kosalā, to the north-west of Magadha and next to Kāsī.  It is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mahājanapadas (E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, etc.).  In the Buddha's time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Vidūdabha.  By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala, for we find that when Bimbisāra, king of Magadha, married Kosaladevī, daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi, a village in Kāsī was given as part of the dowry (J.ii.237; iv.342f).  Various Jātakas indicate that the struggle between Kāsi and Kosala had been very prolonged (See, e.g., J.ii.21f; iii.115f; 211f; v.316, 425).  Sometimes the Kāsi king would attack Kosala, capture the king and rule over the country.  At others the Kosala king would invade Kāsi and annex it to his own territory.  Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this, are mentioned by name - e.g., Dabbasena (J.iii.13), Dīghāvu (J.iii.211f), Vanka (J.iii.168) and Kamsa; the last being given the special title of "Bāranāsiggāha," (J.ii.403; v.112) probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of Kāsi.  Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned - e.g., Dīghiti (J.iii.211f; Vin.i.342f), Mallika (J.ii.3), and Chatta (J.iii.116).  Sometimes the kings of the two countries entered into matrimonial alliances (e.g., J.iii.407).  With the capture of Kāsi the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Magadha became inevitable.  Bimbisāra's marriage was probably a political alliance, but it only served to postpone the evil day.  Quite soon after his death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants.  Once Ajātasattu was captured alive, but Pasenadi spared his life and gave him his daughter, Vajirā, in marriage and for a time all went well.  Later, however, after his conquest of the Licchavis, Ajātasattu seems to have succeeded in establishing his sway in Kosala.  (See Vincent Smith, op.  cit., 32f).  In the sixth century B.C.  the Sākyan territory of Kapilavatthu was subject to Kosala.  The Sutta Nipāta (vs.405) speaks of the Buddha's birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans; see also A.i.276, where Kapilavatthu is mentioned as being in Kosala.  Elsewhere (M.ii.124) Pasenadi is reported as saying, "Bhagavā pi Kosalako, aham pi Kosalako."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthi was the capital of Kosala.  Next in importance was Saketa, which, in ancient days, had sometimes been the capital (J.iii.270; Mtu.i.348).  There was also Ayojjhā, on the banks of the Sarayu, which, judging from the Rāmāyana, must once have been the chief city; but in the sixth century B.C.  it was quite unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river Sarayu divided Kosala into two parts, Uttara Kosala and Dakkhina Kosala (Law: Geog., p.6).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravatī (D.i.235) and the Sundarikā (S.i.167; SN.  p.97; but see M.i.39, where the river is called Bāhukā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among localities spoken of as being in Kosala are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icchānangala (A.iii.30, 341; iv.340, etc.), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukkatthā (D.i.87), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ekasālā (S.i.111), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opasāda (M.ii.164), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesaputta of the Kālāmas (A.i.188), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candalakappa (M.ii.209), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toranavatthu (S.iv.374), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dandakappa (A.iii.402), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagaravinda (M.iii.290), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nalakapāna (A.v.122; M.i.462), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nālandā (S.iv.322), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pankadhā (A.i.236), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venāgapura (A.i.180), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veludvāra (S.v.352), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sālā (M.i.285, 400; S.v.227), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sālāvatika (D.i.244), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setavya (D.ii.316).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mtu.  adds Dronavastuka (iii.377) and Mārakaranda (i.317).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (E.g., SNA.ii.400f; DA.i.239f) give a curious explanation of the name Kosalā.  It is said that when nothing could make Mahāpanāda smile, his father offered a big reward for anyone who could succeed in doing this.  People, accordingly, left their work and flocked to the court, but it, was not until Sakka sent down a celestial actor that Mahāpanāda showed any signs of being amused.  When this happened the men returned to their various duties, and on their way home, when meeting their friends, they asked of each other, "Kacci bho kusalam, kacci bho kusalam." The district where this occurred came to be called Kosalā on account of the repetition of the word kusala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in Sāvatthi or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala.  (See Vinaya Index, s.v.  Kosala).  It is said (SA.i.221) that alms were plentiful in Kosala, though, evidently (J.i.329), famines, due to drought, were not unknown.  Yet, though woodland tracts were numerous (see, e.g., SA.i.225) where monks could meditate in solitude, the number of monks actually found in Kosala was not large (VT.i.226).  Bāvarī himself was a native of Kosala (SN.v.976), yet he preferred to have his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, his unnaloma was deposited in a thūpa in Kosala (Bu.xxviii.9).  It is said that the measures used in Kosala were larger than those of Magadha - thus one Kosala pattha was equal to four Magadha patthas (SNA.ii.476).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosala is often mentioned in combination with Kāsi in the compound Kāsi-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kāsi-Kosala (e.g., A.v.59) (cf.  Ariga-Magadha).  See also Pasenadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kosala&lt;/b&gt;.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of names.  M.iii.70; ApA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khadirangāra Jātaka (No.40)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was Treasurer of Benares, and a Pacceka Buddha, rising from a seven days' samāpatti, came to him at meal time.  The Bodhisatta sent him some food, but Māra created a pit of glowing khadira-embers between the Pacceka Buddha and the Treasurer's house.  When the Treasurer heard of this, he took the bowl of food himself and stepped into the pit, ready to die rather than to have his alms-giving thwarted.  A lotus sprang up to receive his foot, the pit vanished, and Māra, discomfited, vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika,Anāthapindika')"&gt;Anāthapindika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devatā, who lived in the upper storey of his palace, had to come with her children down to the ground floor whenever the Buddha visited Anāthapindika.  She tried to check the merchant's munificence by talking to his manager and his eldest son, but all in vain.  At last, when as a result of his extreme piety Anāthapindika's wealth was exhausted, the devatā ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take heed.  He ordered her out of the house, and she had, perforce, to obey.  In despair she sought the aid of Sakka, who suggested that she should recover for the merchant all his debts, and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been lost sight of.  She did so, but Anāthapindika, before consenting to pardon her, took her to the Buddha, who then related this Jātaka.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/velaama_sutta,Velāmaka Sutta')"&gt;Velāmaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was also preached on this occasion (J.i.226-34; see also the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visayha_jat_340,Visayha Jātaka')"&gt;Visayha Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;).  For a continuation of the story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siri_jat_284,Siri Jātaka')"&gt;Siri Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.447) the Khadirangāra Jākata was preached in reference to the two friends Sirigutta and Gharadinna.  It is said (AA.i.57) that at the preaching of the Jātaka eighty-four thousand beings realised the Truth.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khānu Kondañña&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera.  He became an arahant while living in the forest.  One day, while sitting on a flat stone, he entered into a trance.  A pack of thieves, mistaking him for the trunk of a tree, piled their sacks on to his head and body and slept around him.  In the morning, discovering their mistake, they begged forgiveness and, having listened to his preaching, became monks.  It was this incident which gained for him the name of Khānu ("stump").  The Buddha praised him on account of his achievement (DhA.ii.254f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khānu Kondañña's samādhi is classified under vipphārā iddhi, inasmuch as even the uproar, caused by the thieves in piling up their sacks, did not disturb it.  E.g., BuA.24; PsA.497.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotisimbali Jātaka (No.412)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Garuda-king seized a Nāga-king, and when the Nāga coiled himself round a banyan-tree the Garuda uprooted the banyan and took it with him.  He ate the Nāga's fat seated on a kotisimbali-tree, and threw away the banyan and the Nāga's carcase.  A bird who was in the banyan-tree left it and took up his abode in the simbali.  The Bodhisatta, who was a tree-sprite in the simbali, trembled at the sight of the tiny bird, because the sprite knew that from the bird's droppings huge trees would spring up and kill the simbali.  The Garuda, seeing the sprite trembling, asked the reason, and on learning it frightened the bird away.  It is right to distrust where distrust is proper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to five hundred monks who were in danger of being overcome by sinful desires (J.iii.397ff).  Cf.  the Pālasa Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of the Vatsas or Vamsas (J.iv.28; vi.236).  In the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;.  (MA.ii.740f; DhA.i.164f).  Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha's Parinibbāna (D.ii.146,169).  It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; from the south and the west.  (See, e.g., Vin.i.277).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city was thirty leagues by river from Benares.  (Thus we are told that the fish which swallowed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula,Bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt; travelled thirty leagues through the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yamunaa,Yamunā')"&gt;Yamunā&lt;/a&gt;, from Kosambī to Benares, AA.i.170; PsA.491).  The usual route from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; to Kosambī was up the river (this was the route taken by Ananda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt;, Vin.ii.290), though there seems to have been a land route passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anupiya,Anupiya')"&gt;Anupiya&lt;/a&gt; and Kosambī to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  (See Vin.ii.184f).  In the Sutta Nipāta (vv.1010-13) the whole route is given from&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maahissati,Mahissati')"&gt;Mahissati&lt;/a&gt; to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthi, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena's park, the Udakavana, where Ananda and Pindola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena's palace on two different occasions (Vin.ii.290f; SNA.ii.514; J.iv.375).  The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Simsapāvana in Kosambī (S.v.437).  Mahā Kaccāna lived in a woodland near Kosambī after the holding of the First Council (PvA.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already in the Buddha's time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī - the Kukkutārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana (these being given by three of the most eminent citizens of Kosambī, named respectively, Kukkuta, Ghosita and Pāvārika), and the Badarikārāma.  The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.  (Thomas, op.  cit., 115, n.2, doubts the authenticity of the stories connected with the Buddha's visits to Kosambī, holding that these stories are of later invention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha spent his ninth rainy season at Kosambī, and it was on his way there on this occasion that he made a detour to Kammāssadamma and was offered in marriage Māgandiyā, daughter of the brahmin Māgandiya.  The circumstances are narrated in connection with the Māgandiya Sutta.  Māgandiyā took the Buddha's refusal as an insult to herself, and, after her marriage to King Udena, tried in various ways to take revenge on the Buddha, and also on Udena's wife Sāmavatī, who had been the Buddha's follower.  (DhA.i.199ff; iii.193ff; iv.1ff; Ud.vii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great schism once arose among the monks in Kosambī.  Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed.  The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong.  The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged.  The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks' behaviour, the quarrel grew apace.  The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference.  In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakalonakāragāma and the Pācīnavamsadaya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest.  In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthi, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute.  (Vin.i.337-57; J.iii.486ff (cp.iii.211ff); DhA.i.44ff; SA.ii.222f; the story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in Ud.iv.5. and in S.iii.94, but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.  But see UdA.248f, and SA.ii.222f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give two reasons for the name Kosambī.  The more favoured is (E.g., UdA.248; SNA.300; MA.i.535. Epic tradition ascribes the foundation of Kosambī to a Cedi prince, while the origin of the Vatsa people is traced to a king of Kāsī, see PHAI.83, 84) that the city was so called because it was founded in or near the site of the hermitage once occupied by the sage Kusumba (v.l.  Kusumbha).  Another explanation is (e.g., MA i.539; PsA.413) that large and stately margossa-trees (Kosammarukkhā) grew in great numbers in and around the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula was the son of a banker in Kosambī.  (MA.ii.929; AA.i.170).  In the Buddha's time there lived near the ferry at Kosambī a powerful Nāga-king, the reincarnation of a former ship's captain.  The Nāga was converted by Sāgata, who thereby won great fame.  (AA.i.179; but see J.i.360, where the incident is given as happening at Bhaddavatikā).  Rujā was born in a banker's family in Kosambī (J.vi.237f).  Citta-pandita was also born there (J.iv.392).  A king, by name Kosambaka (q.v.), once ruled there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (Vin.ii.298; Mhv.iv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (Vin.ii.307).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambī is mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.179; but see AA.i.170; MA.ii.929; PsA.491, all of which indicate that the city was on the Yamunā) as being "Gangāya nadiyā tīre." This is either an error, or here the name Gangā refers not to the Ganges but to the Yamunī.  Kosambī is identified with the two villages of Kosam on the Jumna, about ninety miles west of Allahabad.  (CAGI.448f; Vincent Smith places it further south, J.R.A.S.1898, 503ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korakkhatta (Korakkhattiya)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naked ascetic in Uttarakā.  He bellowed like a dog, walked on all fours, and licked up food with his mouth only.  Sunakkhatta saw him and greatly admired him, but the Buddha prophesied that Korakkhatta would, in seven days, die of epilepsy and be born among the Kālakañjakas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prophecy proved true, and Sunakkhatta learnt the truth from Korakkhatta's corpse (D.iii.6ff; J.i.389f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.819) that Korakkhattiya was so called because his feet turned inwards (anto vankapādo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Kurungamiga Jātaka (No.21).-&lt;/b&gt; Once the Bodhisatta was an antelope who used to eat the fruit of a sepanni-tree.  One day a huntsman discovered him and lay in wait to kill him, but the Bodhisatta suspected his presence and so escaped death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; plots to kill the Buddha, the huntsman being identified with Devadatta.  J.i.173f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kurungamiga Jātaka (No.206).&lt;/b&gt;-In a forest lived three friends: an antelope, a woodpecker and a tortoise.  One night the antelope was caught in a huntsman's noose, and the tortoise set about biting through the thongs of the noose while the woodpecker, uttering cries of ill-omen, kept the huntsman in his hut.  The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, exhausted by his labours, was caught by the huntsman.  The antelope thereupon enticed the hunter into the forest and, eluding him, released the tortoise.  The antelope was the Bodhisatta, Sāriputta the woodpecker, Moggallāna the tortoise and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; the hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Devadatta's wickedness (J.ii.152ff; DhA.iii.152f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Jātaka is figured on the Bharhut Stupa.

But he was often seized by fits of lustful passion, and even when, following the Buddha's instructions, he meditated in the charnel field, he could not control the tendency.  The Buddha himself went with him and bade him mark the putrefaction and dissolution of dead bodies around him.  He attained first jhāna, developing which he won arahantship (ThagA.i.444f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā verses (393-8) ascribed to him are a record of this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A.ii.72f.; it is also found at Vin.ii.109; see also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandhavatta_203,Khandhavatta Jātaka')"&gt;Khandhavatta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Khandha Vagga.&lt;/b&gt;-The third book of the Samyutta Nikāya.  It consists of thirteen chapters (Samyuttas).  In Burma a special tīkā was written on this section.  Bode, op.  cit., 103.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Khandha Samyutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The twenty-second chapter of the Samyutta Nikāya and the first chapter of the Khandha Vagga.  It consists of one hundred and fifty suttas, divided into three sections.  The chapter deals mainly with the five khandhas or constituent elements.  S.iii.1-188.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkuta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kukkuta.-One of three bankers of Kosambī, the others being Ghosaka and Pāvāriya.  Having heard from some ascetics, whom they had entertained, of the appearance of the Buddha, they went with these ascetics to Sāvatthi, each carrying offerings in five hundred carts.  Having heard the Buddha preach, they became sotāpannas.  They gave alms to the Buddha for a fortnight, and then, with his permission, returned to Kosambī.  They built monasteries in their gardens for the use of the Buddha and his monks, that built by Kukkuta being called the Kukkutārāma.  The Buddha stayed one day at a time in each monastery, and on that day accepted the hospitality of its founder.  DA.i.318f; DhA.i.203ff; AA.i.234f; PsA.414.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.540f) that the bankers built a monastery for each league on the road between Sāvatthi and Kosambī for the use of the Buddha during his journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kukkuta.-A frontier town near Himavā; the capital of a kingdom three hundred leagues in extent, where Mahā Kappina once ruled.  There were three rivers to cross on the way from Kukkuta to Sāvatthi (ThagA.i.507f; Ap.ii.469).  See also Kukkutavatī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kukkuta.-A rock near Himavā.  Seven Pacceka Buddhas once lived there.  ThagA.i.216; Ap.i.178.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khemappakarana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A work written by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khema,Khema')"&gt;Khema&lt;/a&gt;, a thera, probably of Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhamma_pitaka,Abhidhamma')"&gt;Abhidhamma&lt;/a&gt; and forms one of the Let-than ("Little-finger" manuals) studied in Burma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also known as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naamaruupasamaasa,Nāmarūpasamāsa')"&gt;Nāmarūpasamāsa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commentary on it was written by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaacissara,Vācissara')"&gt;Vācissara&lt;/a&gt; (Gv.61, 71; SadS.63; for details see P.L.C.156).&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundukāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in South India on the tongue of land which juts out from the continent to the island of Rāmissara.  Kundukāla is about eight miles from Rāmissāra (Cv.lxxvi.101).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lankāpura built there a strong camp called Parakkamapura, where he had his headquarters.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokālika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika.  It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokālika.  The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death.  The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses (657-78).  The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta.  Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker.  The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu.  In the Anguttara Nikāya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokālika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokālika (2) speaking ill of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before the Buddha, of Kokālika's illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatī to the Buddha.  A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations.  The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu's verses.  A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kokālika Sutta.-Subrahmā visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and utters verses in reference to Kokālika.  The man who tries to limit the illimitable becomes confused.  S.i.148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kolambahālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon, where Bhalluka pitched his camp (Mhv.xxv.80; see also Mhv.  Trs.176, n.2).  It is probably identical with Kolambālaka (Mhv.xxxiii.42), in which case it was near the Titthārāma, in the neighbourhood of the northern gate of Anurādhapura.  There was also a monastery called Kolambahalāka founded by Sūratissa, and said to have been near Raheraka (Mhv.xxi.5).  The Kolambahālaka-parivena was the residence of the monk Dāthāvedhaka.  MT.176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Konāgamana (Konāgamana)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twenty-third in the list of the twenty-four Buddhas and the second Buddha to be born in the Bhaddakappa.  He was born in the Subhagavatī Park in Sobhavatī, the capital of King Sobha, his father being the brahmin Yaññadatta and his mother Uttarā.  He lived in the household for three thousand years, in three palaces, Tusita, Santusita and Santuttha; his chief wife was Rucigattā and their son was Satthavāha.  Konāgamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka.  His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree.  His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahā-sāla tree.  He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand.  His body was thirty cubits in height.  He died in the Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand.  His relics were scattered.  His chief disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya.  His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen.  The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilā.  He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order.  (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sanghārāma half a league in extent (J.i.94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the Buddha's birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudīpa, hence he was called Kanakāgamana, Konāgamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konāgamana visited their Island (then known as Varadīpa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahānoma garden at Vaddhamāna, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine.  At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth.  At the Buddha's wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l.  Kanakadattā) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree.  The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people's worship.  He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Konāgamana's time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191).  Konāgamana held the uposatha once a year (DhA.ii.236).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northern books (E.g., Dvy.333; Mtu.i.114; ii.265f, 300, 302, 304, 430; iii.240-7, 330) Konāgamana is called Kanakamuni, Konākamuni, and Kanakaparvata.  A Thūpa, erected on the spot where Konāgamana was born, is thought to have existed down to the time of Asoka, who rebuilt it to double its original size and worshipped it in his twentieth year (Hultszch: Inscrip.  of Asoka, p.165).  Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., ii.19) says he saw thūpas at Konāgamana's birthplace and also at the spot where he met his father after the Enlightenment.  Fa Hien (Travels, p.36) saw thūpas at the latter place and also at the place of the Buddha's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuñcanāga, Kuñjanāga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Kanitthatissa and king of Ceylon (246-8 A.C.) He slew his elder brother Khujjanāga.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his reign occurred the Ekanālika famine, but the king maintained his benefactions uninterrupted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was deposed by Sirināga.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Komudī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full-moon day of the fourth month, Kattika, usually found in the phrase Komudī Catumāsinī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (DA.i.139) says it was so called because then the white water-lily flowered luxuriantly (kumudāni supupphitāni honti).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.155, 176f; D.i.47; M.iii.79, 80; DhA.iii.461; J.v.262, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumārīpañhā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidently the name given to the questions asked of the Buddha by Māra's daughters, Tanhā, Arati and Ragā - when they visited him in order to tempt him - and the Buddha's answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These questions and answers form the Dhītaro Sutta of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f), but a quotation from them given in the Anguttara (A.v.46f) is mentioned as having been taken from the Kumārīpañhā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (AA.ii.828) mentions them as being the questions of Māra's daughters (kumārīnam Māradhītānam pucchā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kīlamangala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kīlamangala.-A district in South India which Lankāpura subdued and gave over to Mālava (Cv.lxxvi.209-11).  Its chieftain (nādālvāra) was Kulasekhara's ally (Cv.lxxvii.80).  It was one of the two divisions of Mangala, the other being called Melamangala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kīlamangala.-A Damila chieftain, ally of Kulasekhara.  Cv.lxxvii.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumbha Jātaka (No.512)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how a forester, Sura, accidentally discovered strong drink, and how, with the help of his accomplice, the ascetic Varuna, he spread abroad the discovery, thus leading to the destruction of all Jambudīpa, had Sakka not appeared on earth and by his exposition of the evils of drink induced Sabbamitta, king of Sāvatthi, to abstain from its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in answer to a question by Visākhā as to the origin of drink.  Once during a drinking festival at Sāvatthi five hundred women, friends of Visākhā visited Jetavana in her company.  On the way they became drunk, which led to their behaving improperly in the monastery.  The Buddha frightened them by his iddhi-power and restored them to their senses.  (J.v.11ff; the DhA.iii.100ff gives a slightly different version of the doings of Visākhā's friends).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the past is also given in the Jātakamālā (No.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kisāgotamī Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kisāgotamī Vatthu.-See Kisāgotamī (2).  DhA.i.70f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kisāgotamī Vatthu.-The story of Kisāgotamī (1).  The introductory part gives an account of her marriage.  DhA.ii.270ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kisāgotamī Vatthu.-The story of Kisāgotamī (1) becoming a sotāpanna.  DhA.iii.432f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosalavihārī Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was born in Vesāli, and was one of those who heard the Buddha preach when he came to quieten the panic which arose there, as recorded in the Ratana Sutta (q.v.).  After the sermon Kosalavihārī left the world.  At the conclusion of his novitiate he dwelt in a forest near a village in Kosala.  A lay adherent seeing him camping under a tree built for him a small hut, and there the thera attained arahantship.  He acquired his name from having dwelt long in Kosala (Thag.59; ThagA.i.134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic in Himavā and gave the Buddha some tuberous roots.  Fifty-four kappas ago he was a king named Sumekhalisama.  He is evidently to be identified with Bilālidāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kisasankicca&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naked ascetic (acelaka), contemporary with the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; and evidently a well-known head of a school; mentioned in company with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda_vaccha,Nanda Vaccha')"&gt;Nanda Vaccha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala,Makkhali Gosāla')"&gt;Makkhali Gosāla&lt;/a&gt; (E.g., M.i.238).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kisasankicca is spoken of as one of the three shining lights of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa,Ajivakas')"&gt;Ajivakas&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.524) and is classified among the paramasukkhābhijātas in the chalabhjāti of the Ajīvakas (q.v.) (A.iii.384; DA.i.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says (MA.i.463) that Kisa was his personal name and Sankicca that of his gotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosiya Jātaka (No.130).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kosiya Jātaka (No.130).&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Benares had a bad wife who lay in bed by day feigning sickness and spent her nights in enjoyment.  The husband worked hard to supply her with dainties, and, in consequence, could not visit his teacher who was the Bodhisatta.  When the latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this medicine or get up and work.  She then knew that her shamming was discovered and abandoned her evil ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a brahmin of Sāvatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way.  The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the story (J.i.463f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the atītavatthu the woman is addressed as "Kosiyā." The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the Kosiyagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya Jātaka (No.226).&lt;/b&gt;-The king of Benares, making war at an unseasonable time while camping in the park, saw an owl (kosiya) being attacked by crows.  The king asked his minister the reason for this; the minister, being the Bodhisatta, said the owl had left his hiding-place too early-that is, before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, who visited Jetavana on his way to quell a border rising; the time was unsuitable for such an enterprise.  J.ii.208f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Jātaka (No.470).&lt;/b&gt;-Given under the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhabhojana_jat_535,Sudhābhojana Jātaka')"&gt;Sudhābhojana Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusāvātī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in the kingdom of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa,Mallas')"&gt;Mallas&lt;/a&gt;.  In the present age it was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusinārā')"&gt;Kusinārā&lt;/a&gt;.  Once it was the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana and was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalakamandaa,Ālakamandā')"&gt;Ālakamandā&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.146f; J.i.392; Cyp.i.4; Dvy.227).  It was then at the head of eighty-four Towns (S.iii.144).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s,Mahā-Sudassana Sutta')"&gt;Mahā-Sudassana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.170f ) contains a long description of the city.  It was the capital of several kings of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasammata,Mahāsammata')"&gt;Mahāsammata&lt;/a&gt; dynasty (Mhv.ii.7; Dpv.iii.9), including &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka,Okkāka')"&gt;Okkāka&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa,Kusa')"&gt;Kusa&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.278ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Buddha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya,Metteya')"&gt;Metteya&lt;/a&gt;, Kusāvatī will be known as Ketumatī (Anāgat.v.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khujjuttarā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was born of a nurse in the house of the banker Ghosita (AA.i.232), and later became a slave of Queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Sāmāvati')"&gt;Sāmāvati&lt;/a&gt;.  The queen gave her daily the eight pieces of money allowed to her by the king for the purchase of flowers.  Khujjuttarā bought flowers with four pieces from the gardener &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining four pieces she kept.  One day the Buddha visited Sumana, and Khujjuttarā, having heard the Buddha preach to him, became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;.  That day she spent the whole amount on flowers.  The queen asked her how she had obtained so many, and she told her the whole story.  From that time Sāmāvatī showed Khujjuttarā all honour, bathed her in perfumed water, and heard the Dhamma from her.  Khujjuttarā became, as it were, a mother to Sāmāvatī, and going regularly to hear the Dhamma, would return and preach it to her and her five hundred attendant women.  Under the instruction of Khujjuttarā they all became sotāpannas.  When Sāmāvatī expressed a desire to see the Buddha, Khujjuttarā suggested that she should pierce holes in the walls of the palace and gaze on the Buddha as he passed along the street.  After the death of Sāmāvatī, Khujjuttarā seems to have spent all her time in religious works, listening to the preaching of the Dhamma.  The Buddha declared her foremost among lay women by reason of her extensive knowledge (bahussutānam).  A.i.26; DhA.i.208ff; AA.i.226, 237f; ItvA.23f.; PsA.498f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in the past, she was a serving-woman of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, and one day, having seen a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha,Pacceka Buddha')"&gt;Pacceka Buddha&lt;/a&gt; who was slightly hunch-backed, she threw a blanket over her shoulder, and bending down to look like a hunchback, she imitated the Buddha's manner of walking.  Therefore, in this present birth she herself was hunchbacked.  On another occasion eight Pacceka Buddhas, receiving their bowls filled with rice-porridge from the palace, found the bowls so hot that they were obliged to move them from one hand to the other.  Seeing this, Khujjuttarā gave them eight ivory bracelets as stands for their bowls.  It is said that these bracelets are still preserved in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara,Nandamūla-pabbhāra')"&gt;Nandamūla-pabbhāra&lt;/a&gt;.  Because of this act Khujjuttarā obtained profound wisdom in this birth, and was able to learn the Tipitaka by heart.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the daughter of a treasurer, and had a friend who was a nun; one day when she was adorning herself at eventide the nun visited her, and as there was no servant-girl at the time Khujjuttarā asked the nun to do various things for her.  As a result she was born as a slave.  Her desire to become chief among learned lay-women was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, on her seeing a similar rank bestowed on a lay-woman (DhA.i.226f, etc.; Dvy.339-41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the discourses in the Itivuttaka are those which Khujjuttarā learned from the Buddha and later repeated to Sāmāvatī and her attendant women.  Because these discourses were all preached at Kosambī and repeated there by her, there was no need to specify the place of their preaching; hence the formula "Ekam samayam Bhagavā Kosambiyam viharati" is omitted, and instead is found "vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā arahatā." (ItvA.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khujjuttarā is several times mentioned as the paragon among lay-women disciples (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.368; S.ii.236), and in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.iii.910) she is given as an example of kāmabhoginiyo (women who enjoyed the pleasures of the senses).  She possessed the patisambhidā while yet a householder, but it was the patisambhidā of the probationer (sekha) (Vsm.442; VibhA.388).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khujjuttarā is identified with the slave-girl in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uraga_jat_154_354,Uraga Jātaka')"&gt;Uraga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.168) and in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488,Bhisa Jātaka')"&gt;Bhisa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.314), the nurse in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_sutasoma_jat_525,Culla-Sutasoma Jātaka')"&gt;Culla-Sutasoma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.192) and the hunchback in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusa_jat_531,Kusa Jātaka')"&gt;Kusa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.312).  Owing to her personal experience (abhijānato) she had the power of recalling her past births (Mil.78).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (UdA.384) that when Sāmāvatī and her companions were burnt to death, Khujjuttarā escaped because she had not participated in their previous misdeeds.  At the time of the fire she was absent from the palace, some say ten leagues away.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesava&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kesava.-An ascetic in Himavā.  His story is given in the Kesava Jātaka.  He is identified with Baka Brahmā (J.iii.145; S.i.144; SA.i.165; MA.i.555).  He is sometimes addressed as Kesi.  E.g., J.iii.144, 362.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kesava.-An Ascetic, also called Nārada.  He saw the Buddha Atthadassī and paid him homage.  He was a previous birth of Pavittha Thera, who is evidently identical with Ekadamsaniya.  Ap.i.168; ThagA.i.185.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kesava.-Another name for Vāsudeva (q.v.).  It is said that he was so called on account of his beautiful hair (kesasobhanatāya).  J.iv.84; PvA.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khantivanna Jātaka (No.225)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A courtier of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, started an intrigue in the king's harem, and a servant of the courtier did likewise in his master's house.  When the courtier brought the servant to the king, the king advised the master to be patient, as good servants were rare, and, said the king, he knew of a courtier who had acted in the same way, but his king did not wish to lose him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to the king of Kosala, who had been made a cuckold by one of his young and zealous courtiers.  J.ii.206f.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korandaka Vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon.  The Visuddhi Magga (p.91) contains the story of a young monk, nephew of the Elder of the Vihāra, who went to Rohana for study; he later returned to the Vihāra, and for three months was waited on by his parents, but he did not reveal his identity, fearing that his parents would prove an impediment to him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This monastery was once the residence of an Elder named Mahā Sangharakkhita.  v.l.  Corakandaka.  MT.606.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kūtadanta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Khānumata.  Kūtadanta consults the Buddha on the best way of making a sacrifice efficacious, and the Buddha tells him of a sacrifice held in days of yore by King Mahā Vijitāvī, under the guidance of his enlightened purohita.  The sacrifice is undertaken with the co-operation of the four divisions of the king's subjects.  The king has eight personal qualifications, as has his chaplain.  No living thing is injured; all the labour is voluntary and the sacrifice is offered, not only on behalf of the king, but of all the good.  No regrets are felt at any stage of the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha then proceeds to tell Kūtadanta of other forms of "sacrifice" more potent than the gift of material things, and ends the sutta with a description of arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the discourse Kūtadanta declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.  D.i.127ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khuddasikkhā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Compendium of the Vinaya, composed by Dhammasiri and ascribed to a period before Buddhaghosa (J.P.T.S., 1883, pp.86f).  To this Compendium there exists a Sinhalese paraphrase of the eleventh century, and based on the Compendium is one Porāna-tīkā by Revata and another by Sangharakkhita.  For details see P.L.C., 77; Bode, op.  cit., 24; see also Sās.69; Svd.  1208f; Gv.62, 70; SadS.64.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukku Jātaka (No.396)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contains several parables which the Bodhisatta, as counsellor to Brahmadatta, king of Benares, employed for the king's instruction.  Like the peak of a roof which falls unless tightly held by the rafters, is a king who must be supported by his subjects who have been won over by his righteousness.  As a citron must be eaten without its peel, so must taxes be gathered without violence.  Like the lotus, unstained by the water in which it grows, is the virtuous man untainted by the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda (J.iii.317ff).  The occasion for the story is given in the Tesakuna Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khema&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The city in which Sumana Buddha was born.  J.i.34; but in Bu.v.21 it is called Mekhala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The city in which Tissa Buddha was born.  J.i.40. In Bu.xviii.16 it is called Khemaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Khema.&lt;/b&gt;-The city in which Kakusandha Buddha was born (J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.13 calls it Khemavatī).  It was the capital of King Khemankara.  See also No.6 below.  See also Dvy.242.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A Khattiya, the Bodhisatta in the time of Kakusandha Buddha.  He gave alms to the Buddha and the monks and entertained the Order (D.ii.7; J.i.42; Bu.xxiii.13; BuA.211).  He helped Rūpanandā to bring a branch of Kakusandha's bodhi-tree to Ceylon.  See also Khemankara.  Mhv.xv.79; MT.351.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The deer-park near Bandhumatī (J.vi.480; Bu.xx.4; AA.i.80, 169).  There the Buddha Vipassī was born, and there he preached his first sermon to his chief disciples, and later another sermon to their eighty-four thousand followers (BuA.196f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Khema is identical with the present Isipatana.  DA.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-The pleasance in which Kakusandha Buddha died (Bu.xxiii.27).  It was near Khemavatī and was the birthplace of Kakusandha.  BuA.209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Khema.&lt;/b&gt;-A pleasance near Usabhavatī; there the Buddha Vessabhū died.  Bu.xxii.30; BuA.209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;.  Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A lake, three gāvutas in extent, to the north of Benares.  It was constructed by King Seyya (v.l.  Samyama).  For details see the Mahāhamsa Jātaka.  J.v.356; J.iv.424.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A setthiputta, nephew of Anāthapindika.  He was very handsome and beloved of all women.  Several times he was brought before the king on charges of adultery, but the king pardoned him out of regard for Anāthapindika.  At the latter's request, the Buddha preached to Khema and showed him the error of his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a champion wrestler, and planted two coloured banners on the golden shrine of the Buddha and made a wish that all women, except his own kinswomen, should fall in love with him at sight.  DhA.iii.481f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A devaputta who visited the Buddha at Jetavana and spoke several verses on the desirability of leading the good life.  S.i.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Khema Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khema_s,Khema Sutta')"&gt;Khema Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (2).  A.iii.358.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Ceylon, pupil of Dhammapālita of Rohana.  He was well versed in the Tipitakā ("tipetakī"), and is mentioned among those who handed down the teaching of the Buddha in Ceylon in pupillary succession.  Vin.v.3; Smp.i.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;.  Khema.&lt;/b&gt;-A teacher, probably of Ceylon, author of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khemappakarana,Khemappakarana')"&gt;Khemappakarana&lt;/a&gt;.  Gv.61, 71; Svd.1222; SadS.65; Sās.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Khema&lt;/b&gt;.-See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khemaka,Khemaka')"&gt;Khemaka&lt;/a&gt; (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumudamāliya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kumudamāliya Thera.-An arahant.  In the time of Atthadassī he was a rakkhasa in a lake near Himavā and gave the Buddha a garland of flowers.  Fifteen kappas ago he was king seven times under the name of Sahassaratha (Ap.i.186f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumudamāliya Thera.-An arahant.  In the past he saw Vipassī Buddha walking in the street and gave him a garland of kumuda-flowers (Ap.i.257f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimsukopama Jātaka (No.248)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four monks came to the Buddha and asked him for a topic of meditation.  He gave them various topics and they, having retired to various places, all became arahants: one by understanding the six-fold sphere, the second the five khandhas, the third the four mahābhūtas, and the fourth the eighteen dhātu.  They returned and related to the Buddha each the particular excellence attained by him, and one of them asked the Buddha how all these methods could lead to Nibbāna.  The Buddha related a story of the past where four sons of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, having asked their charioteer to show them a kimsuka-tree, are shown the tree at four different times: when the buds were just sprouting, when the leaves were green, at the time of blossoming, and at the time of fruit-bearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked to describe the tree, the first likened it to a burnt stump, the second to a banyan tree, the third to a piece of meat, and the fourth to an acacia.  The matter was referred to the king, who solved the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king was the Bodhisatta.  J.ii.265f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandasumana Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was born in Pāvā in the family of a Malla chieftain, and was called Khandasumana because, on his birthday, molasses and jasmine appeared in his house.  Having heard the Buddha preaches in Cunda's mango-grove at Pāvā, he entered the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had built a railing of sandalwood round the thūpa of Padumuttara Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was unable to get any flowers, the king having bought them all for his offerings; he therefore bought a khandasumana-flower at a great price and offered it at the thūpa of the Buddha (Thag.96; ThagA.i.198).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Saparivāriya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.172).  His Apadāna-verses are almost the same as those attributed to Nandiya Thera.  See ThagA.i.82.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kolitagāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village in which &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Mahāmoggallāna')"&gt;Mahāmoggallāna&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was near Upatissagāma and not far from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  See, e.g., SNA.i.326; DhA.i.73; Mtu.iii.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutakannatissa (Kutikannatissa)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second son of Mahācūli and king of Ceylon (16-38 A.C.).  He had entered the Order through fear of the infamous Anulā, but later he led an army against her and slew her.  He founded the Pelagāma-vihāra, built the Vannaka canal, and laid out the Padumassara park.  He founded, for his mother, a nunnery called the Dantageha.  He had also constructed a wall, seven cubits high, round Anurādhapura.  Bhātikābhaya was his son and successor (Mhv.xxxiv.28ff).  The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xviii.37; but see xx.31, where he is called Tissa and his son Nāga) appears to call him Kutikanna-Abhaya, and speaks of him as a very devoted supporter of the nuns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutakanna had a horse of the Ājānīya race called Gulavanna (SA.i.27; MA.ii.654).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two theras are mentioned in the Vibhanga Commentary (VibhA.452) as having been held in special esteem by the king - Cūlasudhamma Thera of Girigāmakanna and Tipitaka-Cūlanāga Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutumbariya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Rohana.  A novice living there was in the habit of getting two ladles of rice at the house of a Lambakanna in the district.  It was a time of scarcity, and one day, seeing a guest in the house, he took only one ladleful.  The Lambakanna was greatly pleased, and when he reported the matter to his friends and acquaintances, they gave the novice sixty meals in perpetuity.  AA.ii.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusanāli Jātaka (No.121)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born as a sprite, in a clump of kusa-grass.  Hard by was a mukkhaka-tree in which lived a Tree-sprite.  One day the king's carpenter, looking for a suitable pillar for the king's one-pillared palace, reluctantly decided to fell the mukkhaka.  Learning of the Tree-sprite's imminent danger, the Bodhisatta assumed the shape of a chameleon and deceived the carpenter in such a way that he saw the mukkhaka as all rotten and of no use for his purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to one of Anāthapindika's friends.  He was of low rank and poor, and Anāthapindika's other friends protested against such intimacy.  But one day the poor friend saved Anāthapindika's house from being burgled.  The Buddha related the story to show how each, according to his strength, could help a friend in need (J.i.441ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the Tree-sprite.  The story is often quoted (E.g., J.iv.77) to show the value of a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandadeviyāputta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk, one of the associates of Devadatta, mentioned with Kokālika, Katamoraka Tissa and Samuddadatta.  They helped Devadatta in his attempt to cause a rift in the Sangha (Vin.ii.196; iii.171).  Khandadeviyāputta defended Devadatta when others blamed him (Vin.iii.174) and was held in great esteem by Thullanandā (Vin.iii.66; iv.335).  The Khuddakapātha Commentary (KhpA.126) mentions him in a list of wicked persons, together with those mentioned above, Ciñcamānavikā, and the brother of Dīghavidassa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimatthi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kimatthi Sutta.-The first part is identical with Kimattha Sutta.  If further questioned as to what is dukkha, monks should answer, "eye is dukkha, rūpa objects are dukkha, eye-contact, etc." S.iv.138&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kimatthi Sutta.-A discussion between Sāriputta and Jambukhādaka at Nālaka.  "What is the purpose of the good life?" "The comprehension of Ill." "Is there a way thereto?" "Yes, the Noble Eightfold Way." S.iv.253.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kimatthi Sutta.-See also Sāmandaka Samyutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khemavatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khemavatī.-The capital of King Khemankara and the birthplace of Kakusandha (D.ii.7; Bu.xxii.13; BuA.209; Dvy.242).  It is sometimes called Khema.  E.g., J.i.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemavatī.-The city of birth of Tissa Buddha (Bu.xviii.16).  There he preached the Buddhavamsa to his relatives (BuA.190).  It is sometimes also called Khema and Khemaka.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundala (v.l.  Kulakundala) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He came of a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and entered the Order, but from want of mental balance he could not concentrate his thoughts.  Then, one day, while begging for alms, he saw how men conducted water whither they wished by digging channels, how the fletcher fixed the arrow shaft in his lathe surveying it from the corner of his eye, how the chariot-makers planed axle and tire and hub.  Dwelling on these things, he soon attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he was a park-keeper, and gave a coconut to the Buddha Vipassī, which the Buddha accepted while travelling through the air (ThagA.i.71f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he is to be identified with Nālikeradāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.447f).  The same Apadāna-verses, however, are also ascribed to Khitaka Thera (ThagA.i.315f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verse attributed to Kundala in the Theragāthā (Thag.19) occurs twice in the Dhammapada, and is in the Dhammapada Commentary mentioned as having been preached once in reference to Pandita-Sāmanera (DhA.ii.147), and once in reference to Sukha-Sāmanera (DhA.iii.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khanda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief disciple of Vipassī Buddha (D.ii.11, 40; Bu.xx.28; J.i.41), whose step-brother he was.  The Buddha preached his first sermon to Khanda and his friend Tissa, the chaplain's son, in the Deer Park at Khema.  Later, Khanda became the Buddha's chief disciple Ekasaññaka (BuA.196; AA.i.80; DA.ii.416; see also 457), in a previous birth, once gave alms to Khanda.  Ap.i.121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khanda&lt;/b&gt;.-Name of a god, the Pali equivalent of the Sanskrit Skanda, mentioned with Siva in the Udāna Commentary.  UdA.351.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khila Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khila Sutta.-Fallowness of heart arises from doubt in the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and the way of training (sikkhā), and from anger against one's fellow-celibates.  A.iii.248; iv.460; D.iii.237; M.i.101; Vibh.377, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khila Sutta.-Same as the above, but here the five vinibandhā, which are elsewhere given as a separate section (see the Vinibandha Sutta), are added at the end of the khilā.  A.v.17ff.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kelāsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kelāsa.-A mountain range in Himavā.  It is one of the five ranges which stand round Anotatta and is of silver colour, two hundred leagues high, bent inwards "like a crow's beak." (SNA.ii.437f; MA.ii.585; UdA.300; AA.ii.759).  It is sixty leagues in breadth, and Ālavaka, on his way to his house, having heard to his great anger that the Buddha was there, placed his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta.  The touch of his foot sent pieces of the rock flying, and his shout "I am Ālavaka" was heard throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelāsa is often used in similes to describe an object that is perfectly white (E.g., J.iv.232; vi.490, 515; the horse Kanthaka, Mbv.26; DhA.i.192; Cv.lxxiii.114), very stately (E.g., an elephant's head or a big building, J.i.321; v.52, 53; Cv.lxxviii.77), or difficult to destroy (E.g., J.v.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahāvastu (ii.97, 109; see also iii.309, 438), Kailāsa is mentioned as the abode of the Kinnaras.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sanskrit mythology, Kailāsa is given as the abode of the gods, chiefly Siva and Kubera.  See, e.g., Epic Mythology passim and Ved.  Ind.  s.v.  The mountain range has been identified as belonging to the trans-Himālayan system and consisting of a group of mountains over twenty thousand feet in height (see Cv.Trs.i.280, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kelāsa.-A vihāra in Ceylon, probably in the district of Malagana.  At one time sixty thousand monks dwelt there with Khuddatissa at their head (M.xxxii.53).  This is probably not the Kelāsa vihāra (in Jambudīpa?) whence, we are told, Suriyagotta came with ninety thousand monks to the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa.  M.xxix.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kikī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Benares at the time of the Buddha Kassapa.  When the Buddha arrived in Benares, the king, having listened to his sermon, entertained the Buddha and his monks at the palace.  When the Buddha was asked to spend the rainy season there he refused, as he had already accepted the invitation of Ghatīkāra of Vehalinga.  Kikī was at first hurt by the refusal, but when the Buddha described Ghatīkāra's virtues, the king was pleased and sent five hundred cartloads of provisions to Ghatīkāra who, however, curtly refused the gift (D.ii.7; M.ii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Kikī's daughters was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uracchadaa,Uracchadā')"&gt;Uracchadā&lt;/a&gt;, who attained arahantship at the age of sixteen.  He had seven other daughters - Samanī, Samanā, Guttā, Bhikkhudāsikā, Dhammā, Sudhammā and Sanghadāsī - who, in this Buddha-age became respectively Khemā, Uppalavannā, Patācārā, Gotamā, Dhammadinnā, Mahāmāyā and Visākhā.  J.iv.481; in the Ap.ii.561f, the names are Samanī, Samapaguttā, Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā, Dhammā, etc., and they are mentioned as having lived celibate lives; see also Sattamba; both the Apadāna and the ThigA.17, 103f, omit the name of Mahāmāyā from this list and have, instead, the name of Bhaddā Kundalakesā, identifying her with Bhikkhadāyikā.  The Mtu.i.303f mentions another daughter Mālinī Kisāgotamī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had also a son, Pathavindhara (Puthuvindhara), who succeeded him to the throne (ThagA.i.151).  During the life of the Buddha Kassapa Kikī waited on him with many kinds of gifts (SnA.i.281, 283), and at his death built one of the four gates outside the Buddha's cetiya.  The gate was a league in width (SnA.i.194).  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.420), Kikī was the aggupatthāka of Kassapa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sanskrit books he is called Kikī, and is mentioned as owning a palace called Kokanada (E.g., Mtu.i.325; Divy.22f; Avadānas i.338, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambiya (Kosambaka) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama,Ghositārāma')"&gt;Ghositārāma&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt; to the quarrelsome monks of that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta deals with amity and the six means of promoting it - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acts, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;words &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and thoughts of goodwill, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sharing all things with one's fellow celibates, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;living the higher life in its entirety, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;following the doctrine that leads to the destruction of Ill, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and introspection, which leads to the realisation of truth (M.i.320ff; cp.&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upakkilesa_s,Upakkilesa Sutta')"&gt;Upakkilesa Sutta&lt;/a&gt; M.ii.152ff).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kosambaka Sutta is given (E.g., in DA.i.123) as an example of a discourse originating from a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokanadā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kokanadā.-Two daughters of Pajjunna, both called Kokanadā, though the younger was sometimes called Cūla-Kokanadā.  They visited the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and spoke verses in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  S.i.29f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokanadā.-One of the palaces of Siddhattha Buddha in his last lay life.  Bu.xvii.14; BuA.  (185) calls it Padumā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandhena Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khandhena Sutta.-All the khandhas are impermanent.  He who has faith in the doctrine is a saddhānusāri; he who has understood it moderately is a dhammānusāri; he who knows and sees the doctrine is a sotāpanna.  S.iii.227f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khandhena Sutta.-The arising of suffering is due to the arising of the body, etc.; its cessation is brought about by their cessation (S.iii.231).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khandhena Sutta.-Desire and lust (chandarāga) for body, etc., brings about corruption of the mind.  S.iii.234.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khantivādī Jātaka (No.313)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, under the name of Kundaka, was once born in a very rich family of Kāsī.  After the death of his parents he gave away his immense wealth in charity and became an ascetic in the Himālaya.  Returning later to Kāsī, he dwelt in the royal park, being tended by the commander-in-chief.  One day Kalābu, king of Benares, visited the park with his harem and, falling into a drunken sleep, left the women to their own devices; they, wandering about and meeting the ascetic, asked him to preach to them.  When the king woke he sought his women, and seeing the ascetic and being told that he had been preaching on patience (khanti), he gave orders that the ascetic's own patience be tested.  The ascetic was subjected to various forms of ill-treatment until, becoming more and more angry at his composure, the king gave orders for him to be tortured by the cutting off of his limbs.  As the king left the park the earth opened and he was swallowed in Avīci.  The commander-in-chief, hearing what had happened, hurried off to the ascetic to ask forgiveness.  The ascetic declared that he bore no malice, and died of his injuries with a blessing to the king on his lips.  It is told by some that he went back to the Himālaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related at Jetavana in reference to a wrathful monk (J.iii.39-43).  Kalābu was Devadatta and the commander-in-chief, Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka is frequently mentioned as an example of supreme forgiveness, the ascetic being referred to as Khantivādī (E.g., DhA.i.126; KhpA.149; J.i.46; iii.178; vi.257; BuA.51).  The Jātaka further illustrates how a man's anger can grow towards an unoffending victim (J.iv.11), and how an angry man loses all his prosperity (J.v.113, 119).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kula Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kula Sutta.-Families consisting of many women and few men are molested by robbers; likewise a monk who has not developed emancipation of mind through love is easily molested by non-humans (S.ii.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kula Sutta.  Asibandhakaputta visits the Buddha at the Pāvārika-ambavana in Nālandā at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta,Nigantha Nātaputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nātaputta's&lt;/a&gt; request, and tells the Buddha that he does wrong in obtaining alms from famine-stricken &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"&gt;Nālandā&lt;/a&gt;.  The Buddha replies that his begging does not come within the eight causes of injury to families: viz., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the actions of kings and robbers, fire, water, loss of savings, slothfulness, wastrels and impermanence.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asibandhakaputta becomes the Buddha's follower (S.iv.322f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kula Sutta.-The five advantages which accrue to families visited by holy men: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;they cleanse their hearts and attain to heaven; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they greet the monks respectfully and are born noble; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they conquer greed and gain power; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;give alms and obtain wealth; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ask questions and become wise (A.iii.244f).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kula Sutta.-Seven reasons for which a family is not worth visiting: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;they neither greet one nor show courtesy; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide no seats; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hide what they have; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;having much, give little; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;what they do give they give carelessly and half-heartedly (A.iv.10).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Kula Sutta.-Similar to 4. Nine reasons are given, the additional ones being: they show no desire to hear the doctrine and take no interest when it is preached to them.  A.iv.387.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kitti.&lt;/b&gt;-A court official of Kassapa Vikkamabāhu, son of Mahinda V.  He lived in Makkhakudrūsa, and when the Colas pillaged Rohana, he, with the help of the minister Buddha of Māragallaka, defeated them and drove them to Pulatthipura.  When the king offered him a boon, he desired that the portion of his revenues appropriated by the monks should be remitted.  Cv.lv.26ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kitti.&lt;/b&gt;-Commander-in-chief of Kassapa Vikkamabāhu.  When the king died he seized the throne and reigned for eight days, till be was killed by Mahālāna-Kitti.

Kitti.&lt;/b&gt;-Commander-in-chief of Vikkamabāhu.  He was slain by Viradeva.  Cv.lxi.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kitti Lankādhinātha.&lt;/b&gt;-A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  His son was Lankāpura.  They both took part in the great fight against Gajabāhu.  In recognition of his services he was given the office of Lankādhikari; he was earlier known as the Sankhanāyaka.  He helped in liberating Gajabāhu from the power of Mānābharana, and later defeated the forces of Gajabāhu when they attacked Parakkamabāhu (Cv.lxx.205, 215-20, 278, 300, 316).  Kitti took part in the campaigns of Parakkamabāhu against his foes, these latter being defeated at the Yakkhasūkara ford and at Billagāma.  Later, as a result of disregarding the king's instructions, Kitti fell into the enemy's hands at Surulla (Cv.lxxii.21, 122, 138).  He was, however, pardoned and sent to Dīghavāpi, where be helped in winning for Parakkamabāhu the Sacred Bowl and the Tooth Relics (Cv.lxxiv.90, 110, 119, 136ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Kitti.&lt;/b&gt;-Another general of Parakkamabāhu I.; one of the two Dandanāyakabhātaro (q.v.), the other being Sankhadhātu.  Kitti was granted the rank of Nagaragalla.  Cv.lxx.280; lxxii.162.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;.  Kitti Ādipotthakī.&lt;/b&gt;-A minister of Parakkamabāhu I.  He was first stationed at the Assamandala ford and later at Mangalabegāma.  Afterwards he was sent to Anurādhapura against Mahinda and to Kyānagāma against Mānābharana (Cv.lxxii.27, 160, 207).  He seems to have been known also as Bhandārapotthakī (Cv.lxxii.82) and Jīvitapotthakī.  Cv.lxxiv.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Kitti Lankāpura.&lt;/b&gt;-A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  and son of Kitti Lankādhinātha (Cv.lxx.218).  During the king's campaign against his enemies, Kitti was posted at Balapāsana (Cv.lxxiv.178).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Kitti Nagaragiri&lt;/b&gt;.-A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  He was one of the generals in charge of the Sinhalese expedition to Rāmañña and led the attack against the port of Kusumi.  Cv.lxxvl.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Kitti Kesadhātu.&lt;/b&gt;-A general of Parakkamabāhu I.  He was one of the leaders of the Sinhalese army which fought against the Damilas (Cv.lxxvi.255, 269).  He may be identical with Kitti (9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Kitti Senāpati.&lt;/b&gt;-General of Lilāvatī.  He deposed Codaganga, placed Līlāvatī on the throne, and carried on the government for three years (1197-1200) (Cv.lxxx.30).  He was a patron of learning (P.L.C.207).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Kitti (v.l.  Kittā).&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana, and wife of Mahinda, uparāja of Sena I.  (Cc.l.50, 60).  Her brothers were Kassapa, Sena and Udaya.  She had one daughter and four sons, one of whom was the Ādipāda of Kittaggabodhi (Cv.li.16, 94).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Kitti.&lt;/b&gt;-Queen of Mahinda IV.  She built a parivena to the west of the Thūpārāma, and had baths built there and in Kappāsagāma and Cīvaracetiya.  She dedicated a golden banner twelve cubits long to the Mahā Thūpa.  Cv.liv.50ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambiya (Kosambaka) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama,Ghositārāma')"&gt;Ghositārāma&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt; to the quarrelsome monks of that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta deals with amity and the six means of promoting it - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acts, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;words &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and thoughts of goodwill, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sharing all things with one's fellow celibates, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;living the higher life in its entirety, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;following the doctrine that leads to the destruction of Ill, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and introspection, which leads to the realisation of truth (M.i.320ff; cp.&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upakkilesa_s,Upakkilesa Sutta')"&gt;Upakkilesa Sutta&lt;/a&gt; M.ii.152ff).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kosambaka Sutta is given (E.g., in DA.i.123) as an example of a discourse originating from a quarrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kūtavinicchayaka-peta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Bimbisāra's judges, who was a cheat, a slanderer, and a taker of bribes, once observed the fast for half a day through a friend's persuasion.  He died that night and was born as a Vemānika-peta.  He enjoyed divine pleasures, but was condemned to eat the flesh off his own back in expiation of his evil deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nārada saw this peta and reported his story to the Buddha.  Pv.iii.9; PvA.209f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuhakābrāhmana Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A certain brahmin would climb a tree, grasp a branch with his feet and, swinging head downwards like a bat, demand pennies, etc., from passers by, threatening to kill himself and destroy the city if his request were refused.  The Buddha hearing of this related a Jātaka story in which a false ascetic, having received some lizard meat, liked it and wished for more.  He lay in wait for the king of the lizards when the latter came to pay his respects to him in order to kill him, but the lizard-king, suspecting him, escaped, reproaching him for his hypocrisy.  DhA.iv.153ff; cp.  the Godha Jātaka; also J.i.480f and ii.382f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutumbiyaputta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-He once went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; with twenty-nine of his friends from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; to make offerings to the Buddha.  Having heard the Buddha's preaching, they all became monks.  After five years' residence with their teachers, they wished to retire into solitude and obtained from the Buddha topics for their meditations.  While on the way to the forest, Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa weakened in his determination and turned back.  When the rains were over, the others, having won arahantship, returned and reported their various attainments to the Buddha.  Kutumbiyaputta heard the Buddha praise them, and made up his mind to follow their example and so to go back with them the next day to the forest.  That same night, however, filled with a yearning not to delay in beginning his austerities, he slept in an upright posture; but in the middle of the night he fell down and broke his thighbone.  This accident delayed the departure of the other monks, and the Buddha, hearing of it, blamed Tissa for his unseasonable zeal and related the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varana_jat_071,Varana Jātaka')"&gt;Varana Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, showing how, in the past too, he had behaved similarly (J.i.316f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries lead us to believe (E.g., SA.ii.216; AA.i.29; see also Padhānakammika-Tissa) that Kutumbiyaputta did ultimately attain arahantship, for he is mentioned several times with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pitimalla,Pitimalla')"&gt;Pitimalla&lt;/a&gt; and others as an example of one who put forth great exertion while suffering severe pain, in order to win his goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  He lived in Piyangudīpa.  Dutthagāmani, fleeing from the battle at Cūlanganiyapitthi, wished to give a share of his food to a monk before sitting down to eat.  When the meal-time was announced, the thera Gotama, hearing it with his divine ear, sent Kutumbiyaputta to receive the share set apart for the brotherhood (Mhv.xxiv.22ff; xxxii.31f).  It transpired later that the food so received was divided by Kutumbiyaputta among twelve thousand monks in Piyangudīpa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha, friend of Suciloma.  He was passing through Gayā with Suciloma when the latter questioned the Buddha on his doctrine, as recorded in the Suciloma Sutta (S.i.207f.; SN., p.47f.; SNA.i.302).  Khara had been a monk in a previous birth, and had once rubbed on his body oil belonging to the Sangha without asking the permission of the monks.  As a result his body was ugly, and his skin coarse and rough and like a "tiled roof." Whenever he wished to frighten anybody his skin would stand up like tiles on a roof.  At the end of the recitation of the Suciloma Sutta, Khara became a sotāpanna, and his skin became beautiful and golden-hued.  Ibid., 305.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumbhaghosaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the chief treasurer of Rājagaha.  Plague breaks out in the city and attacks the chief treasurer and his wife.  When about to die they bid farewell to Kumbhaghosaka, directing him to flee for his life and return later to dig up their treasure.  He spends twelve years in a jungle and returns to find the treasure undisturbed; but reflecting that since he is unknown in the city he may be subjected to annoyance if he is seen digging up the treasure and spending it, he decides to earn his own living and obtains a position as foreman.  One day the king, hearing his voice, exclaims: "That is the voice of some rich man." Several times this happens, and then a female servant, overhearing the king's words, offers for a consideration to make him master of the man's wealth.  She obtains lodgings for herself and her daughter in Kumbhaghosaka's house and contrives to make him seduce her daughter.  A marriage is arranged, and Kumbhaghosaka is obliged to dig up some of the wealth in order to defray the various expenses proclaimed by the king's orders.  When the plot is complete, Kumbhaghosaka is summoned before the king, who, having heard his story, confirms him in his inheritance and gives him his own daughter as wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king tells the story to the Buddha, who praises Kumbhaghosaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutajapupphiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kutajapupphiya Thera.-An Arahant.  Ninety-two kappas ago he offered a kutaja-flower to Phussa Buddha.  Seventeen kappas ago he was king three times under the name of Pupphita.  Ap.i.191.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kutajapupphiya Thera.-Thirty-one kappas ago, while travelling through the air, he saw the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana at Cāvala near Himavā, and offered him a kutaja flower (Ap.ii.451).  He is probably identical either with Hārita (ThagA.i.88) or Candana Thera (ThagA.i.395f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkuravatika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Haliddavasana to Punna, follower of the Bovine Vow (living like an ox), and to Acelaka Seniya, follower of the Canine Vow.  In answer to their persistent questions, the Buddha says that the further state of both is either purgatory or rebirth as an animal (among cattle and dogs respectively).  He then proceeds to describe the four kinds of actions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Dark, with dark outcome; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) bright, with bright outcome; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) both dark and bright with similar outcome; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) neither dark nor bright with corresponding outcome.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Punna and Seniya take refuge in the Buddha, Seniya later becoming an arahant (M.i.387ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kisalayapūjaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety-four kappas ago he was born in Dvāravatī.  One day, seeing the Buddha Siddhattha going through the air with his attendant monks, he threw up into the sky, as an offering, an asoka shoot covered with buds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Ekassara.  Ap.i.200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambika-setthi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker of Kosambī.  He adopted Ghosaka (q.v.), but later, when he had a son of his own, he tried in various ways to kill Ghosaka.  All his plans failed, and he developed diarrhoea and died, even his plans of disinheriting Ghosaka having been frustrated by Ghosaka's wife.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambika-setthi's slave-woman, who helped in all his nefarious schemes, was called Kālī.  DhA.i.174-85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkutārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kukkutārāma.-A monastery in Kosambī, built by the setthi Kukkuta (q.v.).  DA.i.318, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kukkutārāma.-A pleasaunce in Pātaliputta.  It was evidently the residence of monks from very early times, probably, for some time, of the Buddha himself.  The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.300) mentions the names of several theras who lived there: Nilavāsi, Sānavāsi, Gopaka, Bhagu, Phalikasandana.  The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.15f; 171f) records several discussions which took place there between Ananda and Bhadda.  It may have been a favourite resort of Ananda, for we find the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara going there to enquire as to his whereabouts (A.v.342; M.i.349).  It was also (probably at a later date) the residence of Nārada who converted King Munda (A.iii.57f), and afterwards of Sonaka, the upajjhāya of Siggava, and of Candavajji, the teacher Mogaliputta-Tissa (Mhv.v.122).  Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutarāma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further particulars.  Here there is probably some confusion with the ārāma of the same name at Kosambī.  Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op.  cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkutārāma was to the southeast of the old city of Pātaliputta and was built by Asoka when he first became a convert to the Buddha's religion.  "It was a sort of first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction." Only the foundation of the building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang's visit.  It is probable that this account refers to the Asokārāma which Asoka built as the first of his Buddhist structures, and that the Asokārāma was constructed on the site of the old Kukkutārāma.  It is significant that the Pāli books, in recording Asoka's doings, make no mention of a Kukkutārāma existing in his time, though the Sanskrit texts, the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.381f, 430ff; see also Smith: Asoka, 183, 193f), for instance, makes frequent reference to it.  If the conjecture made above, namely that the Asokārāma replaced the Kukkutārāma, be correct, it may have been that the place was known by both names in Asoka's time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kukkutārāma.-See Kukkutagiri-parivena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kosala Sutta.-While Pasenadi is visiting the Buddha, a messenger arrives and announces the death of Mallikā.  The king is greatly grieved, but the Buddha consoles him by pointing out how it is impossible to escape old age, decay, disease, destruction.  A.iii.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kosala Sutta.-Everything changes, even Pasenadi, king of Kāsi-Kosala, the whole universe, even Mahā Brahmā and the devas of the Abhassara world.  Instability and change are everywhere; therefore the wise loathe all, having a mind only to attain in this life the anupadāparinibbāna (A.v.59ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kosala Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the Buddha at Jetavana after having won a battle, and, falling at the Buddha's feet, shows great humility and does obeisance.  When the Buddha asks the reason for such profound homage, the king gives various reasons for his honouring of the Buddha (A.v.65ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Koñca&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Koñca.-See Kañcana (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Koñca.-One of the three palaces of Vidhura-pandita.  J.vi.289.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Koñca.-King of Mantāvatī, and father of Sumedhā.

Kosika, Kosiya.&lt;/b&gt;-A rock near Himavā where Nārada Kassapa had a hermitage.  Ap.ii.381.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosika.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha.  He once lived in Cittakūta, and Ukkāsatika, in a previous birth, seeing him wandering about Himavā, lit round him at night one hundred torches and gave him alms.  Ap.ii.414.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosika.&lt;/b&gt;-A king who was destroyed with his subjects for having insulted a sage.  ThagA.i.368.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundalā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of the king of Devaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she was a bitch in Kakubandhakandara and a sāmanera, Tissa, had given her a little food.  Later, when Tissa was on his way to the Bodhi-tree (in Gayā) she saw him, and, remembering her past existence, invited him to the palace and entertained him.  Later she built a vihāra for him, where he attained arahantship.  Ras.i.103f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kurudhamma Jātaka (No.276)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhananjaya,Dhanañjaya')"&gt;Dhanañjaya&lt;/a&gt;, king of the Kurūs, and, after his father's death, reigned in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indapatta,Indapatta')"&gt;Indapatta&lt;/a&gt;.  He observed the Kurudhamma - that is to say, the pañcasīla - as did the queen-mother, his queen-consort, the viceroy, the chaplain, the king's driver, his charioteer, the treasurer, the keeper of the royal granaries, the palace porter and the courtesan of the city.  The country thus became very prosperous and its people happy.  In the kingdom of Kalinga there was a drought and consequent scarcity of food.  The king, acting on the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to beg from the Bodhisatta the loan of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, who was reported to bring rain.  The elephant was lent willingly but no rain fell.  It was thereupon decided that the prosperity of the Kurus was due to the Kurudhamma observed by the king and the others, and messengers were despatched to find out which these Kurudhammas were.  From the king down to the courtesan, all had rigorously kept them, but each had unwittingly done something which he or she considered a violation of the dhamma.  The messengers, therefore, had to visit each one and take down a list of the dhamma.  The incidents related by each to the messengers, explaining wherein they had transgressed the dhammas, only served to emphasise how scrupulously they had conducted themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kalinga king practised the Kurudhamma and rain fell in his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had killed a wild goose.  Two monks bathed in Aciravatī, and while standing on the bank, drying, they saw two geese appear.  The monks took a bet as to which should hit the goose in the eye, and one of them threw a stone which pierced one eye and came out of the other.  The monk was reported to the Buddha.  J.ii.365ff; DhA.iv.86ff; cp.  Cariyāpitaka i.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introductory story compare that of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salittaka_jat_107,Sālittaka Jātaka')"&gt;Sālittaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.418).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kulupaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kulupaka Sutta.-Five qualities which make a monk disagreeable to the families he visits: he is intimate on slight acquaintance (asanthavavissāsī); takes privileges without justification (anissaravikappi); tries to bring together estranged families (viyatthūpāsevī); is a gossip (upakannakajappī); and is importunate (atiyācanako).  A.iii.136f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kulupaka Sutta.-The five evil results of visiting families: sitting together in secret, and in concealed places, tendency to go uninvited, talking about women, and being filled with lustful thoughts.  A.iii.258f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kulupaka Sutta.-Five evil results of visiting families too often-frequent sight of women and consequent danger to celibacy in varying degrees.  A.iii.259.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kulupaka Sutta.-The Buddha says that Mahā Kassapa has the qualities requisite to becoming a monk worthy of visiting families.  He is not vexed even if they give scantily, tardily or disrespectfully.  S.ii.200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kharaputta Jātaka (No.386)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Senaka, king of Benares, saved a Nāga-king from being beaten to death by village lads, and the Nāga in gratitude gave the king many gifts, including a Nāga maiden to minister to him, and a charm by which he might trace her if ever she went out of his sight.  One day the king went with her to the park, and there Senaka found her making love to a water-snake and struck her with a bamboo.  She went to the Nāga-world and complained that she had been ill-treated.  The Nāga-king sent four attendants to kill Senaka, but they, overhearing the king relating the story to his queen, reported the matter to the Nāga-king.  The latter confessed his error to Senaka, and in order to make amends taught him a charm which gave him the knowledge of all sounds.  Senaka was told that if he taught anyone else the charm he would perish in flames.  Senaka's queen discovered his possession of the charm, and did not cease to beg him to teach it to her, even though she knew that by so doing he would incur death.  Unable to resist her, Senaka went with his queen to the park to teach her the charm and enter the flames.  Sakka's throne was heated, and transforming himself and his wife into goats they waited for the king, and on the approach of his chariot began to make love.  The steeds in the chariot were shocked and upbraided the goats for their stupidity, but the goats replied that the steeds were stupid to let themselves be fastened to a chariot which carried so stupid a king as Senaka.  The king, hearing their conversation, alighted from the chariot and, sending the queen on, asked of Sakka how he could evade his promise.  Sakka suggested that the queen be told that she would receive one hundred lashes as part of her initiation.  The queen agreed to this, but, when the flogging started, wished to change her mind, but the king, remembering her selfishness, caused the flogging to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related concerning a monk who was tempted by his former wife.  Senaka was identified with the monk; Sāriputta was the chief steed and Sakka the Bodhisatta (J.iii.275ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the verses in the Jātaka occurs also in the Mahāsutasoma Jātaka.  J.v.498.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala-devī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of Mahā Kosala and sister of Pasenadi.  She was married to Bimbisāra, and a village in Kāsi was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry.  She was the mother of Ajātasattu.  (Ajātasattu is called Videhiputta).  When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed.  Bimbisāra satisfied her longing.  When Bimbisāra was imprisoned by Ajātasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so.  After his death she died of grief, and Pasenadi made war on Ajātasattu to avenge her death.  J.ii.237; 403; iii.121f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kisāgotamī &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kisāgotamī Therī.-An arahant.  She was declared chief among women disciples with respect to the wearing of coarse robes (lūkhacīvara-dharānam) (A.i.25; the DhA.iv.156 contains a story of the Buddha speaking to Sakka the praises of Kisāgotamī).  She came from a poor family in Sāvatthi (of a setthikula, which had fallen on evil days, says the Apadāna p.565, vs.19).  Gotamī was her name - she was called Kisā because of her thinness.  She was married into a rich family, by whom she was disdainfully treated; but as soon as she bore a son she was shown respect.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Except by her husband says the Apadāna loc.  cit.20. The DhA.ii.270ff account, however, makes no mention of her ill treatment; on the contrary, it leads us to expect that she should have been greatly esteemed because, prior to her arrival, her father-in-law's wealth, forty crores in amount, had all turned into charcoal.  When she touched the charcoal it once more became gold.  This account is found also in SA.i.149).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy, however, died when just old enough to run about; his mother, distraught with grief, fearful lest the dead child should be taken from her, went about with him on her hip, seeking medicine to revive his life.  People laughed at her, until one wise man, realizing her condition, directed her to the Buddha.  The Buddha asked her to bring him a mustard seed from a house where no one had yet died.  In the course of her search for the impossible her frenzy left her, and having grasped the truth, she laid the child in the charnel field, and returning to the Master begged admission to the Order.  She became a Sotāpanna, and soon after, when her insight was developed, the Buddha appeared before her in a blaze of radiance and, listening to his words, she became an arahant.  (ThigA.174ff; Ap.ii.564f; DhA.i.270ff; AA.i.205).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the verses ascribed to her in the Therīgāthā (vv.213-23), she incorporates the story of Patācārā in her own psalm, as though to utter more fully the pageant and tragedy inherent in woman's lot, whereof her own sorrow was but a phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was a householder's daughter in Hamsavatī, and having heard the Buddha assign to a bhikkhunī the foremost rank among wearers of coarse robes, she vowed that one day the same rank should be her's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the fifth daughter of Kikī and her name was Dhammā.  Then she entered the Order and lived a celibate life (Ap.ii.564f; ThigA.190f).  She is identified with the lizard in the Tittira Jātaka (J.iii.543).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta Nikāya (i.129f) records a visit paid to her by Māra as she sat resting in Andhavana.  He was forced to retire discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kisāgotamī.-A Khattiya-maiden of Kapilavatthu.  She saw from her balcony Siddhattha Gotama returning in his chariot to his palace on receipt of the news that a son had been born to him.  Gotamī was gladdened by the sight of him, and gave vent to her exultation in the famous "nibbutā-pada" (nibuttā nūna sā mātā, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gotama was pleased by the mention of the word nibbuta, which to him meant deliverance, and as a mark of his gratitude sent her the necklace of pearls which he wore, worth one hundred thousand.  She accepted it gladly as a token of his love (J.i.60f; BuA.232f).  She is sometimes spoken of as a cousin of Gotama, his father's brother's daughter (pitucchādhītā).  (E.g., DhA.i.70; DhSA.34. A parallel has been drawn between this story and that of Luke xi.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kisāgotamī.-Wife of the Buddha Phussa in his last lay life.  Their son was Ananda.  Bu.xix.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kisāgotamī.-One of the chief women supporters of the Buddha Tissa.  Bu.xviii.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Kūtadanta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very learned brahmin of Khānumata, which village had been given to him by King Bimbisāra as a brahmadeyya.  The Buddha arrived at Khānumata when Kūtadanta was making preparations for a great sacrifice and, wishing this sacrifice to be successful, he consulted the Buddha on the holding of sacrifices.  The Buddha preached to him the Kūtadanta Sutta.  At the end of the discourse he became a Sotāpanna (D.i.127ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversion of Kūtadanta is considered one of the great spiritual victories won by the Buddha (E.g., J.vi.329).  As a disputant, Kūtadanta is classed with Ambatthaka, Sonadanda and Saccaka.  E.g., MA.ii.697.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kolitagāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village in which &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Mahāmoggallāna')"&gt;Mahāmoggallāna&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was near Upatissagāma and not far from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokālika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika.  It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokālika.  The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death.  The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses (657-78).  The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta.  Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker.  The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu.  In the Anguttara Nikāya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kokālika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokālika (2) speaking ill of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before the Buddha, of Kokālika's illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatī to the Buddha.  A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations.  The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu's verses.  A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kokālika Sutta.-Subrahmā visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and utters verses in reference to Kokālika.  The man who tries to limit the illimitable becomes confused.  S.i.148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khujjasobhita Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Khujjasobhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  He was a brahmin of Pātaliputta.  He entered the Order under Ananda, after the Buddha's death, and in due course won arahantship.  At the First Council held in the Sattapanni Cave, he was sent to bring Ananda to the Assembly.  He travelled through the earth, gave the message to Ananda, and returning through the air announced his arrival to the Sangha, through the medium-ship of a devatā who had been placed at the door of the cave to ward off Māra and his followers.  Sobhita was called "Khujja" because he was slightly hunchbacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara he saw the Buddha passing with a large assembly of monks and praised him in ten stanzas (Thag.234-6; ThagA.i.350f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Sayampatibhāniya of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.410f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Khujjasobhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the Pācīnaka ("Eastern") monks who proclaimed the ten indulgences at Vesāli.  He was one of their representatives on the Committee of the Sangha appointed to settle the dispute between the monks of Vesāli and the orthodox monks (Vin.ii.305; Dpv.iv.44; v.25, 80).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa (iv.57; this passage is also found in the Samantapāsādikā i.34) this Khujjasobhita was a disciple of Ananda and, therefore, to be identified with Khujjasobhita (1).  The latter was, how-ever, an arahant, and therefore not likely to side with the Vesāli heretics.  The identification is evidently incorrect also on other grounds, among them that of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Licchavi Mahānāma sees a number of Licchavi youths sitting by the Buddha, at the foot of a tree in the Mahāvana at Vesāli; be expresses his joy at the sight for, he says, the Licchavis are usually so mischievous.  The Buddha thereupon tells Mahānāma of five things the practice of which will tend to progress: the tending of father and mother, the support of wife and children with well-gotten wealth, devotion to one's own business, honouring one's own ancestral gods, showing respect to good and holy men.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khemā &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khemā Therī.-An arahant, chief of the Buddha's women disciples.  She was born in a ruling family at Sāgala in the Madda country, and her skin was of the colour of gold.  She became the chief consort of King Bimbisāra.  She would not visit the Buddha who was at Veluvana, lest he should speak disparagingly of her beauty with which she was infatuated.  The king bade poets sing the glories of Veluvana and persuaded Khemā to go there.  She was then brought face to face with the Buddha, and he conjured up, for her to see, a woman like a celestial nymph who stood facing him.  Even as Khemā gazed on the nymph, whose extraordinary beauty far excelled her own, she saw her pass gradually from youth to extreme old age, and so fall down in the swoon of death.  Seeing that Khemā was filled with dismay at the sight, the Buddha preached to her on the vanity of lust, and we are told that at that moment she attained arahantship.  With the consent of Bimbisāra she entered the Order, and was ranked by the Buddha foremost among his women disciples for her great insight (mahāpaññānam aggā) (A.i.25; Dpv.xviii.9; see also MA.iv.168f.; Bu.xxvi.19; J.i.15,16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara she was a slave, and having seen the Buddha's chief disciple, Sujāta, gave him three cakes, and that same day she sold her hair and gave him alms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kassapa Buddha's time she became the eldest daughter of Kikī, king of Benares, and was named Samanī.  With her sisters she observed celibacy for twenty thousand years and built a monastery for the Buddha.  She learnt the Mahānidāna Sutta, having heard the Buddha preach it.  In the time of Vipassī she became a renowned preacher of the Dhamma, and during the time of both Kakusandha and Konāgamana she had great monasteries built for the Buddha and his monks.  AA.i.187f; Thig.139-44; ThigA.126ff; Ap.ii.543ff; DhA.iv.57ff; cf.  the story of Rūpa Nandā (DhA.iii.113-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Khemā was at Toranavatthu, between Sāvatthi and Sāketa, Pasenadi, who happened to spend one night there, heard of her presence and went to see her.  He questioned her as to whether or not the Buddha existed after death.  She explained the matter to him in various ways, and Pasenadi, delighted with her exposition, related it to the Buddha (S.iv.374ff).  She is mentioned in several places (E.g., A.i.88; ii.164; iv.347; S.ii.236) as the highest ideal of womanhood worthy of imitation, and is described as the nun par excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemā is identified with the mother in the Uraga Jātaka (J.iii.168), the queen in the Rohantamiga (J.iv.423) and in the Hamsa (J.iv.430), the queen, Khemā, in the Mahāhamsa (J.v.382), and the princess in the Mahājanaka (J.vi.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khemā Therī.-One of the two chief women disciples of Dhammadassī Buddha (Bu.xvi.19; J.i.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khemā.-The Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.791) (on A.iv.347) speaks of a Khemā Upāsikā in a list of lay-women.  This Khemā is most probably identical with Khemā (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Khemā.-Queen of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  She dreamed of a golden peacock preaching, and wished that her dream might come true.  Though the king tried every means in his power, the wish could not be fulfilled and the queen died.  See the Mora Jātaka.  J.ii.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Khemā.-Chief queen of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  She dreamed of a golden deer preaching the Dhamma, and her wish to see her dream come true was fulfilled (J.iv.256).  For details see the Ruru Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Khemā.-Chief queen of Brahmadatta, king of Benares (J.iv.334).  Her story is similar to that of Khemā (4).  For details see the Mahā-Mora Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Khemā.-Queen Consort of Brahmadatta, king of Benares (J.iv.413).  Her story is similar to that of Khemā (5).  She is identical with Khemā Therī (J.iv.423).  See the Rohantamiga Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Khemā.-Queen Consort of King Seyya (Samyama) of Benares.  She saw a golden swan in a dream, and wished to see one in real life (J.v.354).  She is identified with Khemā Therī (J.v.382).  For details see the Mahāhamsa Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Khemā.-A river flowing from Himavā (J.v.199f).&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosiya Jātaka (No.130).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kosiya Jātaka (No.130).&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of Benares had a bad wife who lay in bed by day feigning sickness and spent her nights in enjoyment.  The husband worked hard to supply her with dainties, and, in consequence, could not visit his teacher who was the Bodhisatta.  When the latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this medicine or get up and work.  She then knew that her shamming was discovered and abandoned her evil ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a brahmin of Sāvatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way.  The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the story (J.i.463f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the atītavatthu the woman is addressed as "Kosiyā." The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the Kosiyagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya Jātaka (No.226).&lt;/b&gt;-The king of Benares, making war at an unseasonable time while camping in the park, saw an owl (kosiya) being attacked by crows.  The king asked his minister the reason for this; the minister, being the Bodhisatta, said the owl had left his hiding-place too early-that is, before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, who visited Jetavana on his way to quell a border rising; the time was unsuitable for such an enterprise.  J.ii.208f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Jātaka (No.470).&lt;/b&gt;-Given under the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhabhojana_jat_535,Sudhābhojana Jātaka')"&gt;Sudhābhojana Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandhavatta Jātaka (No.203)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi,Kāsi')"&gt;Kāsi&lt;/a&gt;, and later became an ascetic.  On it being reported to him that many ascetics died of snake-bite, he gathered them together and taught them how, by cultivating love for the four royal races of snakes - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Virūpakkhas, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Erāpattas, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Chabbyāputtas, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Kanhagotamas - &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;they could prevent themselves from ever being bitten by any creature.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who died of snake-bite.  J.ii.144ff..  cf.  Vin.ii.109f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is evidently an expansion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandha_paritta_v_sam,Khanda Paritta')"&gt;Khanda Paritta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kevatta &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kevatta (v.l.  Kevaddha).-A householder of Nālandā.  Once when the Buddha was staying in the Pāvārika-ambavana at Nālandā, Kevatta visited him.  The interview is recorded in the Kevatta Sutta.  (D.i.211ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (DA.i.388) speaks of him as a young householder, distinguished and wealthy, belonging to the gahapati-mahā-sala-kula, with forty crores of wealth.  He was possessed of very great piety, and it was his extreme devotion to the Buddha which led him to make the request contained in the Kevatta Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kevatta.-Chaplain of Cūlani-Brahmadatta, king of Uttarapañcāla.  He was wise and learned and clever in device; the king followed his counsel and conquered all the territories of India except that of King Videha in Mithilā (J.vi.391-5).  When at last Brahmadatta laid siege to Mithilā, Kevatta was responsible for the details of the siege, but his plans were upset by Mahosadha, who, though his junior in age, was far wiser.  At one stage of the struggle Kevatta suggested that a trial of intellect be arranged between him and Mahosadha, the result of the conquest to decide the victory of Brahmadatta or Videha.  The challenge was accepted, but Mahosadha, by a ruse, made Kevatta appear as though paying obeisance to him and rubbed Kevatta's head in the dust, bruising it.  After the return, in disgrace, of Brahmadatta to Uttarapañcāla, Kevatta meditated revenge through the instrumentality of Pañcāla-candī.  Kevatta visited Mithilā with a proposal that Videha should go to Uttarapañcāla and marry Pañcālacandī.  During this visit, Kevatta went to visit Mahosadha, but the latter, guessing that the whole thing was a plot to kill Videha, refused to see Kevatta and caused him to be ill-treated (J.vi.400-19).  Kevatta was everywhere defeated in his schemes by Mahosadha.  J.vi.424, 438, 461; for details see the Mahā Umagga Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevatta is identified with Devadatta (J.vi.478).  He is mentioned as having belonged to the Kosiyagotta and is addressed as Kosiya.  J.vi.418, 419.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kulāvaka Jātaka (No.31)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born in Macala under the name of Magha.  He spent his time with the heads of the other twenty-nine families in the village, engaged in various forms of social service.  The headman, finding his gains diminish, made a false report to the king, who ordered Magha and his friends to be trampled by elephants; but by virtue of their mettā they could not be killed, and thereupon the king showed them great favour.  After death they were all born in Tāvatimsa, with Magha as Sakka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of Magha's wives - Sudhammā, Cittā and Nandā - who had persuaded him to let them share in his good work, were born as Sakka's handmaidens.  But Sujātā, who had taken no part in their activities, received no such honour.  At that time the Asuras shared Tāvatimsa with the Devas, but one day they got drunk and were hurled down to the foot of Sineru.  They therefore declared war on the Devas, and during one of their fierce battles Sakka was defeated and fled over the sea in his chariot Vejayanta.  When he came to Simbalivana, the chariot felled down the trees there, and the young Garulas were hurled into the sea.  Hearing their cries of agony, Sakka made his driver, Mātali, turn the chariot and go back.  The Asuras, seeing him return, thought it was another Sakka coming with reinforcements, and fled in terror.  The Vejayanta-pāsāda rose from the earth, and Sakka lived in it, having fortified his city with a fivefold guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had drunk water without first straining it, because his friend, with whom he was travelling and with whom he had fallen out, had the only strainer available.  Mātali is identified with Ananda (J.i.198ff; with the introductory story cp.  Vin.ii.118).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the version given in the Dhammapada Commentary (i.263ff; see also SA.i.260f; DA.iii.710ff; and SNA.ii.484f; according to these accounts Sakka was helped by not 29 but 33 others), the story of Magha is related in response to a question asked of the Buddha by the Licchavi Mahāli.  The reason given for Sakka's flight in the Vejayantaratha also differs.  According to this account, when Sujātā (q.v.) was reborn as the daughter of Vepacitti and the time came for her to choose a husband, Sakka went to the assembly in the guise of an aged Asura and was chosen by Sujātā.  Sakka thereupon revealed himself and fled with his bride in the chariot, the Asuras in full chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kulāvaka Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khallātanāga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Saddhā-Tissa and younger brother of Lañjaka-Tissa.  He was king of Ceylon (50-43 B.C.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his religious works was the construction of the Kurundavāsoka Vihāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was killed by the general Mahārattaka.  Khallātanāga's wife was Anulā, and his son was Mahācūlika.  Mhv.xxxiii.29ff.; Dpv.xx.12f.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusinārā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kusinārā Sutta.-Preached at Baliharana in Kusinārā.  Offerings, made to a monk by the pious, bring him no real advantage if, he is slothful; he should be strenuous and vigilant.  A.i.274f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kusinārā Sutta.-Also preached at Baliharana.  A monk wishing to rebuke another monk, should consider five things with regard to himself - whether he is of blameless conduct in body and speech; whether he really wishes well for his colleague and is not influenced by envy; whether he is learned in the doctrine; whether his pātimokkhas are perfect.  He should also consider whether his rebuke is seasonable, justified by facts, administered gently, for the other's benefit and out of compassion for him (A.v.79f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kusinārā Sutta.-Preached at Upavattana in Kusinārā, in the Sālagrove of the Mallas.  The Buddha, just before his death, invites the monks to question him with regard to any doubts or misgivings they may have.  They remain silent (A.ii.79f).  The sutta occurs also as part of the Mahā-Parinibbāna Sutta.  D.ii.137, 154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotisanthāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Jātakas mention is made (E.g., J.iii.18; 375, 397; J.iv.113) of the Buddha when he wished to address the monks of Jetavana, asking Ananda to summon them to the Kotisanthāra and ordering that a seat be prepared for him at the entrance to the Gandhakuti.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotisanthāra was probably the name given to that part of the Jetavana grounds just outside the Buddha's own apartments.  It may have been so called in reference to the fact that Anāthapindika bought the land by spreading on it a crore of kahāpanas (kahāpana-koti-santhārena) (J.i.94).  Or the name may have been restricted to the part actually covered by the pieces of money, for we are told (Vin.ii.159) that the money was not sufficient to cover the whole of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were buildings in the Kotisanthāra, the monks living in these buildings being referred to as "Antokotisanthāre vasantā." (E.g., J.iv.113) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotisanthāra is generally translated as The Golden Pavement, (E.g., Jāt.  Trs.iii.12; iv.71) which seems to be a wrong rendering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuru&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country, one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (D.ii.200; A.i.213 etc.).  Frequent references to it are found in the Pāli Canon.  It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (rājakumārā) of the country and that their territory was later named after them.  Buddhaghosa records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandhātā returned to Jambudīpa from his sojourn in the four Mahādīpas and in the devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru.  They settled down in Jambudīpa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha.  It had many towns and villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country seems to have had very little political influence in the Buddha's time, though, in the past, Pañcāla, Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., J.ii.214).  According to the Jātakas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference.  The ruling dynasty at Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361).  Among the kings of the past, Dhanañjaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya (J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the Bodhisatta Sutasoma.  During the Buddha's time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Ratthapāla, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65ff).  Perhaps at one time the Kuru kingdom extended as far as Uttarapañcāla, for in the Somanassa Jātaka (J.iv.444), Uttarapañcāla is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as its king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koravya had a park called Migācīra where Ratthapāla took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725).  The people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma Jātaka) as the reason for the Buddha having delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the Mahānidāna, and the Mahāsatipatthāna Suttas.  Among other discourses delivered in the Kuru country are the Māgandiya Sutta, the Anañjasappāya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavasā Sutta.  All these were preached at Kammāssadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kurūs, where the Buddha resided from time to time.  Another town of the Kurūs, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the birthplace of Ratthapāla, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30).  Udena's queen, Māgandiyā, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms (DhA.iii.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Thānesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi (CAGI.379f).  See also Uttarakuru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kukkula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the nirayas.  King Dandaki was born there because of his heinous crime (J.v.114, 143; ItvA.195).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarabhanga spoke of him as suffering there, sunk in a mass of glowing coals (kukkula) one hundred leagues deep; huge glowing sparks fall on him and enter his body through nine sores (J.v.144).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside this niraya are the Gūtha-niraya and the Simbalivana.

His sister Kharādiyā brought him her son that he might teach him the wisdom of the deer, but the young deer was disobedient and did not attend his lessons.  As a result, he was caught in a gin and killed by huntsmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an unruly monk.  Kharādiyā is identified with Uppalavannā.

Kondañña.&lt;/b&gt;-The second of the twenty-four Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After sixteen asankheyya and one hundred thousand kappas of pāramī, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;he was born in Rammavatī, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his father being King Sunanda and his mother Sujātā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to the Kondaññagotta and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his body was twenty-eight cubits in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten thousand years he lived as a layman in three palaces - Ruci, Suruci and Subha (Rāma, Surāmā and Subha, according to BuA); &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his chief wife was Rucidevī and his son Vījitasena.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left home in a chariot, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;practised austerities for ten months and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;was given a meal of milk-rice by Yasodharā, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;daughter of a merchant in Sunanda, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;grass for his seat by the Ājīvaka Sunanda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His bodhi was a Sālakalyāni tree, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his first sermon was preached to ten crores of monks in the Devavana near Amaravatī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He held three assemblies of his disciples, the first led by Subhadda, the second by Vijitasena and the third by Udena, all of whom had become arahants.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died at the age of one hundred thousand at Candārāmā, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the thūpa erected over his relics was seven leagues in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chief disciples were Bhadda and Subhadda among monks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;and Tissā and Upatissā among nuns, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his constant attendant being Anuruddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His chief patrons were Sona and Upasona among laymen and Nandā and Sirimā among laywomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was a king, Vijitāvī of Candavatī.  He left his kingdom, joined the Order and was later reborn in the Brahma-world.  Bu.iii.; BuA.107ff; J.i.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kondañña.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of a gotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was evidently common to both brahmans and khattiyas, for we find the brahman&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annaa_kondanna,Aññāta-Kondañña')"&gt;Aññāta-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; belonging to it, and elsewhere (E.g., VibbA.464) it is mentioned as a khattiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those mentioned as belonging to the Kondañña-gotta are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kondanna,Kondañña')"&gt;Kondañña&lt;/a&gt; (brahmin), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candakumaara,Candakumāra')"&gt;Candakumāra&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.137, 138) (khattiya), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga,Sarabhanga')"&gt;Sarabhanga&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.140,141, 142) (brahmin), &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the three Buddhas &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"&gt;Vipassī&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii,Sikhī')"&gt;Sikhī&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessabhuu,Vessabhū')"&gt;Vessabhū&lt;/a&gt;, all khattiyas (D.ii.3ff, see table in Dial.16).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kacchapa_jat_178_215_273,Kacchapa ')"&gt;Kacchapa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.360f) it is said that tortoises are of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;-gotta and monkeys of the Kondañña-gotta, and that between these two classes there is intermarriage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kondañña.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of the apprentice in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaarunii_jat_047,Vārunī Jātaka')"&gt;Vārunī Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotamalaya (? more probably Kotthamalaya)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountainous region in South Ceylon, whither Dutthagāmanī fled from his father's wrath, and where he lived while making preparations for his campaign (Mhv.xxiv.7; xxxii.29; MT.332, 430).  v.l.  Kottamalaya, Kotthamalaya, Kolambamalaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumuda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kumuda.-A niraya - strictly speaking, a period of suffering.  It is equal to twelve Padumas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kokālika monk was born in Kumuda-niraya.  S.i.152f; see also SN., p.126; SNA.ii.476.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumuda.-One of the three palaces of Sobhita Buddha in his last lay life.  Bu.vii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kumuda.-A city.  There an enemy of Piyadassī Buddha, Sona by name, made an unsuccessful attempt to kill him by means of the elephant Donamukha.  Bu.xiv.6; BuA.174.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokanuda (Kokanada)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paribbājaka.  He meets Ananda on the banks of the Tapodā, where they are both bathing, and enters into conversation with him.  Kokanuda asks Ananda a series of questions, such as whether the world is eternal, whether the Tathāgata lives after death, etc., all of which, Ananda says, are impossible to answer, not because he himself does not know these things, but because he does know them.  Finally, Kokanuda asks Ananda who he is, and, on learning his identity, asks his pardon for his questions which he had asked in all ignorance.  A.v.196f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kinti Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Baliharana in Kusinārā.  The Buddha tells the monks that they should school themselves in the higher lore taught by him, such as the satipatthāna, iddhipāda, etc., and lays down rules on the treatment of monks who dispute about the meaning and letter of the Doctrine and of those who are guilty of transgressions.  The sutta derives its name from the first words (kinti) uttered by the Buddha in beginning the sermon.  M.ii.238ff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khīragāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Khīragāma.-A village in Rohana, where the forces of Parakkamabāhu I fought a battle against the rebels (Cv.lxxiv.162f).  In Khīragāma Queen Ratnāvalī was cremated, and on the spot a cetiya was erected.  Cv.lxxix.71; see also Cv.Trs.ii.36, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khīragāma.-See Mahākhīragāma.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kulasekhara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kulasekhara.-A Cholian king of South India.  He besieged the Pandyan king, Parakkama of Madhurā, and the latter sent for help to Parakkamabāhu I.  of Ceylon.  Parakkamabāhu sent an expeditionary force to South India under Lankāpura, but in the meantime the Pandyan king had been slain and his capital taken.  The Sinhalese force, however, landed and carried on a prolonged campaign against Kulasekhara and his allies, who seem to have been numerous and powerful.  Kulasekhara was defeated, and the Pandyan king's son, Vira Pandu, was installed in Madhurā.  The Cola prisoners taken in the war were brought to Ceylon and employed in the reconstruction of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura.  For details of this war see Cv.lxxvi, and lxxvii.  For Kulasekhara's later history see Cv.Trs.ii.100, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kulasekhara.-A Pandu king.  His general Ariyacakkavatti invaded Ceylon in the reign of Bhuvanekabāhu I.  and carried off the Tooth Relic and other treasures.  Later Parakkamabāhu III, visited Kulasekhara and retrieved the Tooth Relic.  Cv.xc.47; 53f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosalavihārī Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was born in Vesāli, and was one of those who heard the Buddha preach when he came to quieten the panic which arose there, as recorded in the Ratana Sutta (q.v.).  After the sermon Kosalavihārī left the world.  At the conclusion of his novitiate he dwelt in a forest near a village in Kosala.  A lay adherent seeing him camping under a tree built for him a small hut, and there the thera attained arahantship.  He acquired his name from having dwelt long in Kosala (Thag.59; ThagA.i.134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic in Himavā and gave the Buddha some tuberous roots.  Fifty-four kappas ago he was a king named Sumekhalisama.  He is evidently to be identified with Bilālidāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundi, Kundiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kundi, Kundiya.-A village of the Kurus.  Near the village was a forest where lived Anganika-Bhāradvāja.  Close by was the Uggārāma.  v.l.  Kundikola.  ThagA.i.339.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kundi.-A village of the Koliyans, near which was the Kundadhāna-vana (q.v.).  It was the birthplace of Kundanagariya (Potthapāda) Thera.  Near it was the Sānavāsipabbata where once Ananda stayed.  PvA.178.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khaggavisāna Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third sutta of the Uraga Vagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata,Sutta Nipāta')"&gt;Sutta Nipāta&lt;/a&gt; (SN.vv.35-75), consisting of forty-one stanzas, each of which ends with the refrain: "eko care khaggavisānakappo." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SNA.i.46ff) divides the sutta into four vaggas and gives each a separate name (except the first), the name being generally derived from the first word of the stanza.  It is said that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; preached the Khaggavisāna Sutta in response to a question asked of him by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; regarding the attainment of Enlightenment by Pacceka Buddhas; the Buddha gave details of their abhinīhara and patthanā, and illustrated them by reciting to Ananda stanzas which had been uttered by Pacceka Buddhas of old on various occasions and at different periods as their paeans of joy (udāna).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa gives the life-story of each of the Pacceka Buddhas whose stanzas are included in this sutta.  It is, however, only in the case of a few Pacceka Buddhas that the actual names are given - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brahmadatta (v.33), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anitthigandha (36), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mahāpaduma (39), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ekavajjika-Brahmadatta (40), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta (41), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cātumāsika-Brahma-datta (44, 64), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sītāluka-Brahmadatta (52), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suta-Brahmadatta (58), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vibhūsaka-Brahmadatta (59), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pādalola-Brahmadatta (61), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anivatta-Brahmadatta (62), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cakkhulola-Brahmadatta (63),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mātanga (74).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest are described as "the king of Benares," or "the son of the king," etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is commented on in the Culla-Niddesa (pp.56ff), in addition to those of the Parāyanavagga, an evidence of the fact that, when the Culla-Niddesa was composed, this was probably regarded as an independent sutta, not belonging to any particular group such as the Uragavagga, and that the comments on it were written at a time prior to the composition of the Sutta Nipāta as an anthology in its present form.  This view is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the Mahāvastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group.  According to the Mahāvastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddhāvāsa devas of the approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each repeating one of the verses of the sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna (i.7ff) includes the stanzas of the Khaggavisāna Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddhāpadāna and prefaces them with several introductory stanzas.  A few stanzas are also added at the end by way of conclusion.  In its exegesis the Apadāna Commentary (ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas.  They are, however, different from those given by Buddhaghosa, and correspond more nearly to those mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isigili_s,Isigili Sutta')"&gt;Isigili Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khomadussa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records the visit of the Buddha to Khomadussa.  The brahmins were gathered on some business, and the Buddha walked into their meeting, thus angering them.  It is said that he caused a shower of rain to fall (perhaps to give him an excuse for taking shelter).  When the brahmins protested against his intrusion, the Buddha told them that it was no "council" where good men were not, and where the rules of debate were not observed; this sermon pleased them.  S.i.184; SA.i.207.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kharassara Jātaka (No.79)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minister of the king of Benares arranged in secret with a band of robbers that when he had collected the revenue of a border village he would march his men off to the jungle, leaving the robbers free to secure the booty.  The plan was carried out, and half the booty was made over to him; but his treachery became known and he was disgraced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a minister of the Kosala king, who was guilty of similar treachery.  J.i.354f.&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korakkhatta (Korakkhattiya)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naked ascetic in Uttarakā.  He bellowed like a dog, walked on all fours, and licked up food with his mouth only.  Sunakkhatta saw him and greatly admired him, but the Buddha prophesied that Korakkhatta would, in seven days, die of epilepsy and be born among the Kālakañjakas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prophecy proved true, and Sunakkhatta learnt the truth from Korakkhatta's corpse (D.iii.6ff; J.i.389f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.819) that Korakkhattiya was so called because his feet turned inwards (anto vankapādo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kokanada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kokanada.&lt;/b&gt;-The palace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhi,Bodhirājakumāra')"&gt;Bodhirājakumāra&lt;/a&gt;, to which he invited the &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;and the monks to a meal when the Buddha was staying at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava,Bhesakalāvana')"&gt;Bhesakalāvana&lt;/a&gt;; the palace was just completed (Vin.ii.127; iv.199; M.ii.91).  The artisan who built it was blinded, in case he should build another like it (J.iii.157; but see DhA.iii.134f, where it is said that, warned by Bodhi's friend, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta,Sanjikāputta')"&gt;Sanjikāputta&lt;/a&gt;, the builder escaped on a magic bird).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.739), the palace was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada,Kokanada')"&gt;Kokanada&lt;/a&gt; (lotus), because it was built in the form of a hanging lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kokanada.&lt;/b&gt;-A lute (vinā) given by Sakka to Sīlavatī, Kusa's mother, and afterwards used by Kusa to win back Pabhāvatī (J.v.281, 290).  It was so called either from the country of its origin or from its colour.  See Jāt.  Trs.v.143 n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kokanada.&lt;/b&gt;-See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanuda,Kokanuda')"&gt;Kokanuda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kuddāla Jātaka (No.70)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a gardener in Benares, and because his only possession was a spade (kuddāla) he was known as Kuddāla Pandita.  Later he became a recluse, but six times thoughts of his spade drew him back to the world.  The seventh time he threw the spade into the river and shouted for joy, winning insight.  The king of Benares heard his shouts, and on knowing the reason for them, resolved to join Kuddāla as an anchorite.  When the news spread, the people from twelve leagues round accompanied them, and Sakka sent Vissakamma to erect monasteries for them in the Himālaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Citta-Hatthisāriputta (q.v.) (J.i.311ff).  The names of some of those who accompanied Kuddāla in his renunciation are mentioned at the end of the Hatthipāla (J.iv.490) and the Mūgapakkha Jātaka.  J.vi.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same story is given in different words in the Dammapada Commentary (DhA.i.311f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Khema Sutta.-An account of the visit paid to the Buddha at Jetavana by the devaputta Khema and the verses uttered by Khema on that occasion.  S.i.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Khema Sutta.-Two monks, Khema and Sumana, living at Andhavana near Sāvatthi, visited the Buddha.  Khema stated before the Buddha that, when a monk has attained arahantship, the thought does not arise in him that he is inferior to anyone or that he has his equal.  Having spoken thus, Khema took leave of the Buddha and departed; Sumana did likewise.  When they were gone the Buddha declared to the monks that, by their statement, Khema and Sumana had manifested their arahantship.  A.iii.358f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Khema Sutta.-On what is meant by having attained peace (khema).  A.iv.455.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Khema Sutta.-The Buddha preaches peace and the path thereto.

The reference is probably to Bhaddā Kundalakesī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kundalī.-The name of the she-ass in the Vātaggasindhava Jātaka (q.v.).  J.ii.338f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kundalī.-The name of a vimāna in Tāvatimsa.  In this vimāna was born a man who once tended Sāriputta and Moggallāna and looked after them when they stayed in a vihāra in Kāsi.  Vv.vi.8; VvA.295f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kundalī.- A brahmin, importer of foreign goods.  He was a friend of Dighābhaya and lived in Dvāramandala.  Mhv.xxiii.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kūtāgārasālā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hall in the Mahāvana near Vesāli.  The Buddha stayed there on several occasions, and in the books are found records of various eminent persons who visited him there and of his conversations with them.  Among such visitors are mentioned several Licchavi chiefs, Mahāli Otthatthaddha (D.i.150ff; S.i.230f; iii.68f; A.v.86f; several visits of Mahāli are mentioned; for details see Mahāli.  BuA.  p.3 mentions that the Buddha spent his sixth rainy season in the Kūtāgārasālā), Nandaka (S.v.389), Sunakkhatta (M.ii.252), Bhaddiya (A.ii.190f), Sālha and Abhaya (A.ii.200), all attended by numerous retinues; their senāpati, Sīha, who went with five hundred chariots, having only decided after much hesitation to see the Buddha (A iii.38f; iv.79, 179ff); the Jaina Saccaka, whom the Buddha won only after much argumentation, as described in the Cūla- and the Mahā-Saccaka Suttas (M.i.227ff; 237ff; the Licchavi Dummukha is also mentioned, M.i.234, as having been present when Saccaka argued with the Buddha); the householder Ugga of Vesāli, acclaimed by the Buddha for the possession of eight eminent qualities (A.iii.49; iv.208f; S.iv.109); the upāsaka Vāsettha (A.iv.258f), the two goddesses, daughters of Pajjunna, both known as Kokanadā (S.i.29f ); and the brahmin Pingiyāni (A.iii.237f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kūtāgārasālā, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc.  And Pingiyānī, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha's praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha (A.iii.239f).  On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks' concentration, but failed to achieve his object (S.i.112).  Several Jātakas were related by the Buddha in the Kūtāgārasālā: the Sigāla (J.ii.5), the Telovāda (J.ii.262), the Bāhiya (J.i.420), and the Ekapanna (J.i.504).  It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns.  They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu (A.iv.274f; Vin.ii.253f; J.ii.392).  The Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine (A.iv.280).  It was also at the Kūtāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis (S.ii.267f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kūtāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent (see, e.g., D.i.151; A.iii.75), seek him there or be conducted to him.  Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body.  He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing (S.v.320f).  Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kūtāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood - e.g., the Sārandada-cetiya (A.iii.167) and the Cāpāla-cetiya (S.v.258; A.iv.308f).  It was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesāli.  He then returned to the Kūtāgārasālā, where he announced that his death would take place within three months (D.ii.119f; S.v.258ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.310; MA.i.450), there was a monastery (sanghārāma) built for the monks in the Mahāvana.  Part of it consisted of a storeyed house, with a hall below surrounded only by pillars.  These pillars held the gabled room which formed the main part of the Buddha's Gandha-kuti there.  The hall lay from north to south and faced east (DA.i.311), and from this hall the whole monastery came to be known as the Kūtāgārasālā.  There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them (E.g., S.iv.210f; A.iii.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books also contain the names of others who stayed at the Kūtāgārasālā when the Buddha was in residence - e.g., Ananda, who was visited there by the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāra (A.i.220); Anuruddha, who lived there in a forest hut (S.iii.116; iv.380); Nāgita, the Buddha's former attendant, and Nāgita's nephew the novice Sīha (D.i.151); also Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkata, Kalimbha, Nikata, and Katissaha, all of whom left the Kūtāgārasālā and retired to the Gosingasālavana, when the visits of the Licchavis to the Buddha became disturbing to their solitude (A.v.133f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later times Yasa Kākandakaputta is mentioned as having stayed there (Sp.i.34; Mhv.iv.12; Dpv.v.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen thousand monks under Mahā-Buddharakkhita went from the monastery in Mahāvana in Vesāli to the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Northern books (Dvy.136, 200; AvS.8; Mtu.i.300), the Kūtāgārasālā was on the banks of the lake Markatā (Markatahradatīre).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesi (Vagga/Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kesi.-A horse-trainer.  He came to see the Buddha and became his follower as a result of the interview (A.ii.112f).  For details see Kesi Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kesi.-Buddhaghosa's father.  He lived in Ghosagāma.  v.l.  Kesa.  Gv.66; Buddhaghosuppatti, p.38; Sās.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kesi.-A noble steed belonging to Ekarāja (J.vi.135).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kesi.-See Kesava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesi Vagga.-The twelfth chapter of the Catukka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.112-21).  The first sutta is that of Kesi, the horse-trainer, and most of the suttas deal with the idea of "training." The Commentary calls it Kosiya Vagga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kesi Sutta.-The horse-trainer.  Kesi visits the Buddlia, and in answer to a question says that he trains some horses by mildness, some by harshness, and others by both; those which do not submit to his training he destroys.  The Buddha says that just so does he deal with men.  Some he tames by mildness - telling them what is good and showing them the way to heaven; others by harshness - condemning the evils in them; yet others by both.  Those who do not submit to this discipline he destroys, by refusing to admonish them (A.ii.112f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.120) that the Kesi Sutta should be one of those used to explain the term purisadamma-sārathī in reference to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutidūsaka Jātaka (No.321)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A singila-bird, seeing a monkey shivering in the rain, suggested to him that he should build a nest.  The monkey, in envy, destroyed the bird's nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka,Ulunkasaddaka')"&gt;Ulunkasaddaka&lt;/a&gt;, who had burnt down &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā-Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā-Kassapa's&lt;/a&gt; hut in a forest near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  At that time Mahā Kassapa had two novices, one serviceable and helpful and the other ill-behaved.  Whatever was done by his comrade the latter would pretend that he himself had done it.  One day, in exasperation, the good novice heated water for the Elder's bath and then hid it in a back room, leaving only a little in the boiler.  When the other novice saw the steam rising he informed the Elder that his bath was ready.  When asked where was the water, he let a ladle down into the almost empty boiler and the ladle rattled.  When the story became known he was nick-named Ulunkasaddaka ("Rattle-ladle").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being found fault with on this and several other occasions, he bore the Elder a grudge, and one day, having set fire to the Elder's hut, he ran away.  Later he was born first as a peta and then in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici,Avīci')"&gt;Avīci&lt;/a&gt;.  This incident was reported to the Buddha by monks who came from Rājagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkey of the Jātaka is identified with the wicked novice.  J.iii.71ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosala-devī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of Mahā Kosala and sister of Pasenadi.  She was married to Bimbisāra, and a village in Kāsi was given to her for bath-money as part of her dowry.  She was the mother of Ajātasattu.  (Ajātasattu is called Videhiputta).  When pregnant with him, she was filled with a desire to drink blood from the right knee of her husband, and on learning from the astrologers that this presaged the birth of a patricide, she went to the park-called, on that account, Maddakucchi (q.v.) - and tried to bring about an abortion, but failed.  Bimbisāra satisfied her longing.  When Bimbisāra was imprisoned by Ajātasattu she waited upon him, taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so.  After his death she died of grief, and Pasenadi made war on Ajātasattu to avenge her death.  J.ii.237; 403; iii.121f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitāgiri (v.l.  Kītāgiri)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village of the Kāsis, on the road from Kāsi to Sāvatthi.  It was the headquarters of the followers of Assaji and Punabbasu, who lived there, behaving in a shameless and wicked manner.  A certain monk, on his way to Jetavana, passed through the place and was asked by a pious layman to complain to the Buddha of their ill-behaviour.  On hearing of it, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to proclaim on them an act of banishment.  (J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f).  Some time after, when the Buddha visited the place with a large company of monks, including Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Assajipunabbasukā, were asked to provide lodgings for the visitors.  They agreed to do so for the Buddha, but would have nothing to do with Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Vin.ii.171).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.668), Kitāgiri was the name of a nigama (township).  In the Samantapāsādikā (iii.613f) it is called a janapada, favoured by adequate rain and fruitful crops, and therefore chosen by the Assaji-Punabbasukas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.  98).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.  98).-The Bodhisatta was once a merchant named Pandita and entered into partnership with a dishonest man, Atipandita.  When the time came for dividing the profits the latter claimed a larger share, for he, as his name showed, was the "brains" of the business.  To settle the dispute he hid his father in a hollow tree, and feigning to consult a Tree-sprite, referred the matter to the Tree.  Pandita suspecting the ruse, lighted a fire at the foot of the tree and thus exposed the cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a cheating merchant of Sāvatthi, who is identified with Atipandita.  He tried to rob his honest partner, always putting off his claims, in the hope that he would die from the hardships suffered in a long journey they had undertaken for trade.  J.i.404f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kūtavānija Jātaka (No.218).-A villager once deposited five hundred ploughshares with a friend in the town, but when he came to claim them, he was told that they had been eaten by mice, and was shown the dung the mice had left behind.  Some time later the villager took his friend's son to bathe, hid him in a house, and reported to the townsman that the boy had been carried off by a hawk.  When he was taken before the judge, who was the Bodhisatta, he protested that in a place where mice ate ploughshares a hawk could easily carry off a boy.  The Bodhisatta settled their dispute (J.ii.181ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introductory story is similar to that of No.1 above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kutivihārī Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kutivihārī Thera.-An arahant.  He was the son of a nobleman in the Vajji country, and having heard the Buddha preach the Ratana Sutta he left the world.  One day, while striving after insight, he was caught in the rain and sought shelter in a woodman's hut.  As soon as he sat down there on a mat he became an arahant.  The Buddha, having heard by virtue of his divine ear the conversation between the monk and the watchman, uttered verses of approbation.  The monk was so called because he obtained insight in a hut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had given cool water to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.56; ThagA.i.129f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Udakapūjaka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.142f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kutivihārī Thera.-An arahant.  His story is similar to the above.  He pursued his meditations in a very old hut and had thoughts of building another; but a spirit, seeking his welfare, pointed out to him in words which, though simple, carried a profound meaning, that a new hut would mean new pain.  Thus urged on, Kutivihāri became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he gave a fan of split reeds to Padumuttara Buddha (Thag.v.57; ThagA.i.130f).  He is probably identical with Nalamāliya Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.143f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kesaputtiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of suttas preached to the Kālāmas of Kesaputta.  There need be no official tradition, no authority, no subtle reasoning or the like, in order to ascertain the true doctrine and distinguish it from the false.  The noble disciple whose mind is pure has four consolations.  He knows that whether there be a next world or not his happiness is secure.  A.i.188f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka,Okkāka')"&gt;Okkāka&lt;/a&gt;, king of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusaavaatii,Kusāvatī')"&gt;Kusāvatī&lt;/a&gt; and of his queen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siilavati,Sīlavatī')"&gt;Sīlavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  Okkāka has no heir, in spite of performing various rites.  But at length, by the favour of Sakka, Sīlavatī miraculously gives birth to two sons.  The elder, though ill-favoured, is supernaturally wise and is called Kusa.  The younger, very handsome, is called Jayampati.  Kusa consents to marry only on condition that a princess can be obtained exactly like an image which he himself has fashioned.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pabhavati,Pabhāvatī')"&gt;Pabhāvatī&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madda,Madda')"&gt;Madda&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala,Sāgala')"&gt;Sāgala&lt;/a&gt;, is found to fulfil this condition, and is married to Kusa.  The bride is not to look upon her husband's face until she has conceived, but Kusa plays various pranks upon her and she accidentally discovers how ugly he is.  She leaves him immediately and returns to her father's court.  Thither Kusa follows her, and under a variety of menial disguises, including that of a cook, tries, but in vain, to win her affection.  At length &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; intervenes.  He sends letters, purporting to come from King Madda, to seven kings, offering Pabhāvatī to each of them.  They arrive in Sāgala simultaneously and threaten to destroy the city.  Madda decides to cut Pabhāvatī into seven pieces, and she is only saved from immediate death by the despised husband.  At his appearance the kings flee, for wherever he looks the earth trembles.  Kusa returns with his wife to Kusāvatī and they live there happily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleased at Kusa's victory, Sakka gives him a jewel called the Verocanamani.  It was octagonal, and was evidently handed down in the succession of kings, for we are told that one of the tests, set by Videha, king of Mithilā, to discover the proficiency of Mahosadha, was for him to break the old thread in this gem, remove it, and insert a new one.  (J.vi.340; according to SA.i.115 and DA.iii.266, the jewel was also in the possession of Pasenadi; but see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasara_jat_092,Mahāsāra Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāsāra Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, where no mention is made of Kusa).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference is made elsewhere (E.g., MT.552) to a tālavanta (fan?) possessed by Kusa, in which could be seen the forms of all things in the world.  He also possessed the Kokanadavīnā (q.v.) given by Sakka to Sīlavatī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusa is called Sīhassara, and his shout, when he appeared before the seven kings, announcing his name, was one of the four shouts heard throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dīpavamsa (iii.40) speaks of Kusa and Mahākusa, both descended from Mahāsammata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kontimārā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A river which flowed from the hill Ārañjara.  Alongside this river ran the road taken by men who were banished by the people of Sibi; the road was also taken by Vessantara on his way to exile (J.vi.493).  The river is five leagues from Suvannagiritāla and five from Ārañjara.  J.vi.514.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khuddaka Tissa (Khudda Tissa)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera credited with great iddhi-power.  He lived in Mangana, and was one of those who shared the sour millet-gruel given by Dutthagāmani in his flight from battle.  Khuddaka Tissa divided it among sixty thousand monks in the Kelāsa Vihāra (Mhv.xxxii.53f).  He was one of the pacchāgatakā (late comers?) to the Assemblies of Kuddālaka, Mūgapakkha, Ayoghara, and Hatthipāla (J.vi.30).  He is probably identical with Kujja Tissa (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kumārapeta Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kumārapeta Vatthu.-A man of Sāvatthi abused those who gave alms to the Buddha and his monks, but his mother made him retract his words and give alms for seven days.  He was born later as the son of a courtesan who left him in a graveyard.  The Buddha went there and proclaimed that the boy had a great future before him.  The boy was adopted by a rich man and spent his wealth in deeds of piety.  After death he was born as Sakka's son.  Pv.iii.5; PvA.194ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kumārapeta Vatthu.-Two sons of the Kosala king committed adultery and were born as petas.  One night they uttered loud lamentations and the inhabitants of Sāvatthi sought the Buddha's protection.  The Buddha explained things to them, and the people gave alms and made over their merit so gained to the petas.  Pv.iv.6; PvA.261f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundadhānavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forest near the Koliyan village of Kundiya.  (DhA.iv.192 calls it Kundikoliya, v.l.  Kundikeliya).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once the residence of the Yakkha Kunda, who favoured offerings made to him with kunda-dhāna (vessels containing rice-powder?).  A woman, who was the head of a village (gāmapatikā), formed a settlement on a spot indicated by the Yakkha and was guarded by him.  She thus came to be known as Kundiyā, and when, later, the Koliyan nobles built a city on the same spot, the city was known as Kundiya.  In the forest tract the Koliyan nobles built a monastery for the Buddha and his monks.  It was while the Buddha was dwelling in this monastery that Suppavāsā gave birth to Sīvalī, after prolonged labour pains, which only ceased after she received the Buddha's blessing (Ud.ii.8; UdA.122; DhA.iv.192f; J.i.407).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v.l.  Kunditthāna, Kundikāna, Kunhāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Koliyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha.  The Koliyā owned two chief settlements - one at Rāmagāma and the other at Devadaha.  The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas.  We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest.  There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy.  Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons.  With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so.  The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā.  The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kunālā Jātaka (J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once "lived like animals in a Kola-tree," as their name signified.  The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī.  The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha.  (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262).  A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha.  In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha's stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.  (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā).  They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uttara, the residence of the headman Pātaliya (S.iv.340); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sajjanela, residence of Suppavāsā (A.ii.62); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sāpūga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kakkarapatta, where lived Dīghajānu (A.iv.281); and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) (attendant of Moggallāna), and Kankhā-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death the Koliyans of Rāmagāma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha's relics, over which they erected a thūpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff).  See also s.v.  Suppavāsā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kotthasāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village to the east of Pulatthipura.  It was once the refuge of Vikkamabāhu II (Cv.lxi.43) and, again, of Gajabāhu (Cv.lxx.355).  After Gajabāhu's death his ministers took his body to Kotthasāra, and the village became the headquarters of Mānābharana (Cv.lxxi.6, 11).  There was in the village a garrison for mercenary soldiers, specially occupied by the Keralas, and this garrison once revolted against Parakkamabāhu I (Cv.lxxiv.44).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Damilas, Māgha and Jayabāhu, set up a fortification there (Cv.lxxxiii.15; see also Cv.Trs.i.229, n.1).  It was evidently a point of strategic importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosambika-setthi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banker of Kosambī.  He adopted Ghosaka (q.v.), but later, when he had a son of his own, he tried in various ways to kill Ghosaka.  All his plans failed, and he developed diarrhoea and died, even his plans of disinheriting Ghosaka having been frustrated by Ghosaka's wife.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kosambika-setthi's slave-woman, who helped in all his nefarious schemes, was called Kālī.  DhA.i.174-85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keralā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Kerala.  The Keralas served as mercenary soldiers to the kings of Ceylon.  They rebelled against Mahinda V.  and governed certain parts of the country (Cv.iv.5, 12).  They fought in the army of Parakkamabāhu I.  against Gajabāhu (Cv.lxix.18; lxx.230).  Later, when Parakkamabāhu's forces were employed in Rohana, the Kerala mercenaries in Kotthasāra conspired with others to capture Rājarattha, but their attempt was foiled (Cv.lxxiv.44f).  The Keralas formed the largest part of Māgha's army which devastated Ceylon, and Māgha gave over to them, for their use, whatever they coveted in the conquered territory.  They overran the country, carrying destruction wherever they went (Cv.lxxx.61, 76; lxxi.4).  Later, however, they suffered severe defeat at the hands of Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxiii.20).  Once a Pandu king fled from the Cola king and took refuge among the Keralas (Cv.liii.9; Cv.  Trs.i.172, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Korabya, Koravya, Korabba&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the generic name given to the king of the Kurūs (cf.  Brahmadatta).  Once in the Jātakas Koravya is given as the name of the king of Indapatta in the Kuru country, this king being the father of Sutasoma (J.v.457).  Elsewhere (J.ii.368; iii.400, 402; v.59, 61, 65; vi.256, 268, 273) Koravya appears as a title of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs.  Koravya may also have been used as an adjective, for we find it explained as Kururatthavāsika (E.g., J.vi.273).  The Koravya king probably belonged to the Yudhitthilagotta (See J.iv.361).  The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.369f) mentions a king Koravya who owned a large banyan tree named Suppatittha.  According to the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65; see also Thag.776.ff; ThagA.ii.34; for details see Ratthapāla), in the Buddha's day, too, the ruler of Kuru was called Koravyarājā, and he owned a park which seems to have been called Migācīra (q.v.).  This king was evidently interested in religious discussion.  Thullakotthika was his capital.  The Avadānasataka (i.67; ii.118; see also Camb.  Hist.  of India, i.121, which refers to a half-mythical Pañcāla king, Kraivya) speaks of a Kauravya of Thullakotthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The artisan who built it was blinded, in case he should build another like it (J.iii.157; but see DhA.iii.134f, where it is said that, warned by Bodhi's friend, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta,Sanjikāputta')"&gt;Sanjikāputta&lt;/a&gt;, the builder escaped on a magic bird).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.739), the palace was called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada,Kokanada')"&gt;Kokanada&lt;/a&gt; (lotus), because it was built in the form of a hanging lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

They hired themselves out to guide men through the forest.  One day, while conducting a caravan, robbers fell on them and all but the Bodhisatta fled; he remained and drove the robbers off.  When asked how he could do this, he replied that he who would do heroic deeds must contemn life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who had lost energy in his duties (J.ii.335f).&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kilesiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Commentary to the Rathavinīta Sutta (MA.i.361) mention is made of a Kilesiya Sutta in which the Buddha preached Bhagu Thera the virtues of solitude.  I have not been able to trace a sutta of this name.  The Theragāthā Commentary (ThagA.i.380) says that the Buddha visited Bhagu at Bālakalonakagāma after his attainment of arahantship to congratulate him on his solitude (ekavihāram anumoditum).  The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.222) goes further and says that the Buddha visited him on the way from Kosambī to Pācīnavamsadāya, and that during this visit the Buddha preached to him the advantages of solitude (ekacāravāse ānisamsam) for the whole day after the midday meal and the whole night (sakalapacchābhattañ c'eva tiyāmarattiñ ca).  The Vinaya passage (Vin.i.350), however, which records this visit does not make mention of any such special sermon, but merely says that the Buddha inquired after Bhagu's health and wellbeing.  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kundakapūva Jātaka (No.109)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a tree-sprite in a castor-oil tree and received worship and offerings from many people.  Among them was a very poor man who, having nothing else to offer at the tree, took a cake made of husk powder.  But when he saw the other rich offerings, he felt that the sprite would never accept so humble a gift and wished to eat the cake himself.  The tree-sprite appeared, took the offering, and revealed to the man that heaps of treasure lay buried under the tree.  The man informed the king of this, and the king, in return, appointed him royal treasurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a poor man of Sāvatthi.  Once the people of a whole street in that town pooled their resources in order to entertain the Buddha and his monks to a meal of rice-gruel and cakes.  The poor man, unable to afford anything else, made a bran-cake and by sheer determination put it in the alms-bowl of the Buddha himself.  When it became known that the Buddha had accepted it, people of all classes crowded round the man offering him wealth if he would share with them the merit he had gained.  After consulting with the Buddha, the man accepted the offers, and the gifts he received amounted to nine crores.  That same evening the king appointed him treasurer.

He had been a disciple of the Buddha and was born in the Aviha Brahma-world, where he attained to arahantship at the moment of his birth.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kusinārā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa,Mallas')"&gt;Mallas&lt;/a&gt; and the scene of the Buddha's death.  At that time it was a small city, "a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle," and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/parinibbaana,Parinibbāna')"&gt;Parinibbāna&lt;/a&gt;.  But the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, by preaching the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasudassana_s,Mahā-Sudassana Sutta')"&gt;Mahā-Sudassana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusaavaatii,Kusāvatī')"&gt;Kusāvatī&lt;/a&gt;, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana (D.ii.146).  Between Kusinārā and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt;, three gāvutas away (DA.ii.573) - from where the Buddha came to Kusinārā on his last journey from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, stopping at various places - lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river, and near the city, in a south-westerly direction, lay the Upavattana, the Sāla-grove of the Mallas, which the Buddha made his last resting-place (UdA.238; DA.ii.572f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makutabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated.  For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics (D.ii.160f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the Buddha had three reasons for coming to Kusinārā to die: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) Because it was the proper venue for the preaching of the Mahā-Sudassana Sutta; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) because Subhadda would visit him there and, after listening to his sermon, would develop meditation and become an arahant while the Buddha was still alive; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) because the brahman Doha would be there, after the Buddha's death, to solve the problem of the distribution of his relics (UdA.402f; DA.ii.573f6).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, Buddhagayā and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.140).  Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place.  Thus, once he went there from Āpana and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā.  The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred.  It was on this occasion that Roja the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries (Vin.i.247f).  During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (A.i.274f; v.79f) and the "Kinti" Sutta (M.ii.238f).  A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana.  (A.ii.79; for another discourse to some noisy monks at Upavattana, see Ud.iv.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusinārā was the birthplace of Bandhula and his wife Mallikā (DhA.i.338, 349).  It was twenty-five yojanas from Rājagaha (DA.ii.609; acc.  to Fa Hsien, p.40, it was twenty-four yojanas from Kapilavatthu) and lay on the high road from Alaka to Rājagaha, the road taken by Bāvarī's disciples (SN.v.1012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was evidently the road taken also by Mahā Kassapa from Pāvā, when he came to pay his last respects to the Buddha (Vin.ii.284).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a late tradition, one-eighth of the Buddha's relics were deposited in a cairn in Kusinārā and honoured by the Mallas (D.ii.167; Bu.xxviii.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ancient times Kusinārā was the capital of King Tālissara and twelve of his descendants (Dpv.iii.32).  It was also the scene of the death of Phussa Buddha at the Setārāma (v.l.  Sonārāma) (BuA.195; Bu.xix.25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang's&lt;/a&gt; day there still existed towers and Sarighārāmas erected to mark the spots connected with the Buddha's last days and obsequies at Kusinārā.  According to his account (Beal.  op.  cit.li.  lii.  n) Kusinārā was nineteen yojanas from Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the northern Buddhists the place was also known as Kusigrāma (Kusigrāmaka) and Kusinagarī (E.g., Dvy.152f, 208).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kusinārā is identified with the village of Kasia at the junction of the river Rapti and the smaller Gondak and in the cast of the Gorakhpur district (CAGI.i.493).  A copper plate belonging to the thūpa erected at the site of the Buddha's death has recently been discovered (CAGI.i.714).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā.  E.g., D.ii.167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kosiya, Kosiyagotta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Kosiya, Kosiyagotta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a brahmin clan.  In the Pācittiya it is given as one of the lower gottas.  (Vin.iv.8; but it is also Sakka's gotta, and is therefore generally regarded as a high one; see e.g., Thag.415; ThagA.i.452).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those mentioned as belonging to this gotta are the brahmin Kevatta (J.vi.418f), the brahmin who was the father of Sona Kumāra (the Bodhisatta) (J.v.319ff), Bhaddākāpilāni, born in Sāgala (AA.i.99; ThagA.68; SA ii.144), and the banker who came to be known as Macchariya-Kosiya (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kātiyāna's father was a Kosiyan, but he married a woman of the Kātiyāna family (ThagA.i.452).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543,Bhūridatta Jātaka')"&gt;Bhūridatta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.181; Mtu.ii.49) mentions a sage Kosiya, who taught Alambāyana the Nāga-spell.  The scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/salikedara_jat484,Sālikedāra Jātaka')"&gt;Sālikedāra Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.278f) mentions a brahmin of Sālindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same reason.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosiya_jat_130_226_470,Kosiya Jātaka')"&gt;Kosiya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-brāhmanī.  All these are either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts.  The name Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka - once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), once by Mahā Moggallāna (M.i.252) - and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahā Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name means "belonging to the Kusika family." It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not known.  Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, 315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only the god of a Kusika clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means "Owl" and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of animals (cf.  Vaccha).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Macchari-Kosiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Kosiya Thera&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant.  He belonged to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name.  He often listened to the preaching of Sāriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won arahant ship.  He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatī and in the time of Vipassī Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane.  (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ucchukandika of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.393.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Kosiya&lt;/b&gt;.-See Kosika (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Kosiya.&lt;/b&gt;-See Nanda Mānava.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Khandhakā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a portion of the Vinaya Pitaka.  This is generally further divided into two parts, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Mahāvagga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Cullavagga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains an attempt to give a coherent picture of the whole legal life of the Sangha, with detailed and connected accounts of the admission thereto, the ceremony of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt;, the annually recurring observances connected with the rainy season, etc.  An account is given, in the case of each regulation, of the occasion on which it was formulated by the Buddha.  The separate chapters are arranged in chronological order, and are intended to present a connected account of ecclesiastical history from the time of the Enlightenment of the Buddha down to that of the Second Council, convened one hundred years after the death of the Buddha.  (See Oldenberg, Vinaya Pitaka I., Introd., xxii.f.; Law, Pāli Lit., i.14f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways the Khandhakā, resemble the Sutta Vibhanga of the Vinaya, but while in the case of the Vibhanga the stories were added later to an original basis of regulations, the Pātimokkha, in that of the Khandhakā the regulations and the stories were contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Khandhakas consist of eighty bhānavāras (DA.i.13), and are divided into twenty-two chapters, ten in the Mahāvagga and twelve in the Cullavagga.  Each chapter is called a khandhaka.  Thus, the first chapter is the Mahākhandaka; the second, the Uposathakhandhaka, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kūta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Kūta Sutta.-In a peaked house (kūtāgāra) all the rafters converge towards the peak; so are all wrong states fixed together in ignorance.  S.ii.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Kūta Sutta.-Similar to the above; all profitable conditions have earnestness as their peak.  S.v.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Kūta Sutta.-Just as all the rafters slope to the peak, so do the seven bojjhangas tend towards nibbāna.  S.v.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Kūta Sutta.-Two discourses of similar import, preached to Anāthapindika.  When a peaked house is un-thatched, the peak, the roof-beams and the walls are all unprotected.  When thought is unguarded all actions also are unguarded.  A.i.261f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Kūta Sutta.-Of the five powers (saddhā, hiri, ottappa, viriya, paññā) the last is the peak (A.iii.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Kūta Sutta.-Of the five powers, (saddhā, viriya, sati, samādhi, paññā) the last is the peak.  A.iii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kimbilā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kimbilā.  The Buddha asks Kimbila (q.v.) a question on the practice of breathing, and when he fails to reply Ananda requests the Buddha to teach the answer to the monks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta deals with the method of breathing and the results thereof.  S.v.322f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsāmi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsāmi.&lt;/b&gt; A name given by his people to Dappula, governor of Rohana and father of Mānavamma.  Cv.xlv.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsāmi.&lt;/b&gt; A title given to Moggallāna, ruler of Rohana, and father of Kitti (afterwards Vijayabhāhu I.).  Cv.lvii.30, 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāsāmi.&lt;/b&gt; A Thera of Ceylon, to whom tradition ascribes the authorship of the Mūlasikhā.  P.L.C.  77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahāsāmi Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Author of the new tikā on the Nāmarūpapariccheda.  Sās.  69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5&lt;b&gt;.  Mahāsāmi Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Author of a tikā on the Subodhālankāra.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahācora Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robber chief carries on his activities through relying on the inaccessible, the impenetrable and the powerful.  Inaccessible are mountains, etc.; impenetrable are jungles, etc.; powerful are chieftains and their ministers, ready to speak in his defence.  Similarly, a depraved monk depends on crooked actions, wrong views and influential friends.  A.i.153.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahānāma Sutta 1 - 7&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Mahānāma the Sākyan visits the Buddha at Nīgrodhārāma and confesses his worry as to where he would be reborn if he were to meet with an accident while passing through the crowded streets of Kapilavatthu! The Buddha assures him that he need not distress himself as he has for long practised faith and virtue, learning, renunciation and insight.  His mind will soar aloft like a jar of butter or of oil, broken in a deep pool of water, where the fragments of the jar will sink but the butter and the oil float.  S.v.370.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;The circumstances are similar to those of the above sutta.  The noble disciple, possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who cultivates virtues dear to the Ariyans, such a one is destined to Nibbāna.  Mahānāma is such a one.  S.v.371; 404.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;See Godha Sutta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Mahānāma asks the Buddha, at Nigrodhārāma, as to how a man becomes a disciple, how virtuous and a believer, how far is he given to generosity and blessed with insight? The Buddha answers his questions.  S.v.395f.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;The Buddha tells Mahānāma, in answer to his question, that the noble disciple who has won the fruit (āgataphala) and grasped the teaching (viññātasāsana), lives a life of abundance, his mind occupied with thoughts of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, the virtues he practises, his liberality and the devas.  Thus among uneven folk he lives evenly and untroubled.  A.iii.284ff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;On six qualities which are developed in a monk who is faithful, energetic, mindful, concentrated and wise.  His thoughts dwell on the Tathāgata, the Dhamma and the Sangha, on his own generosity and on the devas.  Thus his mind is free from thoughts of ill will, lust, folly; it is direct, And he realises the attha and dhamma and the joy associated with dhamma; his body is serene and his mind filled with joy.  A.v.328ff.; cp.  No.  5 above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top: 8"&gt;Very similar to sutta No.  6. A.v.332ff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Thūpa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great Thūpa in Anurādhapura, built by Dutthagāmani.  The site on which it was erected was consecrated by the visit of all the four Buddhas of this kappa and was at the upper end of the Kakudhavāpi.  It was one of the spots at which Mahinda scattered campaka flowers by way of homage, and the earth trembled.  When Mahinda informed Devānampiyatissa of the great sanctity of the spot and of its suitability for a Thūpa, Tissa immediately wished to build the Thūpa himself, but Mahinda bade him desist, telling him that the work would be carried out in the future by Dutthagāmani.  Tissa recorded this prophecy on a pillar of stone (Mhv.xv.51ff., 167ff).  When Dutthagāmani had won his victory over the Damilas and had brought peace to the country, he saw the prophecy inscribed on the stone pillar, but was unwilling to start the work as the people were too crippled with regard to money to be able to support such an immense undertaking.  But the devas read his thoughts and provided him with all the necessaries for the building of the Thūpa.  Prepared bricks were found on the banks of the Gambhīranadī, copper near Tambapittha, silver in the Ambatthakolalena, pearls at Uruvelā, and gems in a cave near Pelivāpigāma.  The building was started on the full moon day of Visākha.  The foundation stone was laid on the fourteenth day of the bright half of the month of Asālha.  Great celebrations marked the event, arrangements for which were in the hands of the ministers Visākha and Sirideva.  Monks were present not only from all over Ceylon but from many other places: eighty thousand under Indagutta from Rājagaha, twelve thousand under Dhammasena from Isipatana, sixty thousand under Piyadassī from Jetavanārāma, eighteen thousand under Mahā Buddharakkhita from Mahāvana in Vesāli, thirty thousand under Mahā Dhammarakkhita from Ghositārāma in Kosambī, forty thousand under Mahā Sangharakkhita from Dakkhināgiri in Ujjeni, one hundred and sixty thousand under Mittinna Asokārāma in Pātaliputta, two hundred and eighty thousand under Uttinna from Kasmīra, four hundred and sixty thousand under Mahādeva from Pallabhogga, thirty thousand under Yonamahā Dhammarakkhita from Alasandā, sixty thousand under Uttara from Viñjhātavī, thirty thousand under Cittagutta from Bodhimanda vihāra, eighty thousand under Candagutta from Vanavāsa, and ninety six thousand under Suriyagutta from Kelāsa vihāra.  Of arahants alone ninety six crores were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the king stepped into the space left open for him, he expressed the desire that, if his worship were to have a happy result, theras bearing the names of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha, should take their places on the east, south, and west sides respectively, and a thera bearing the name of Ananda on the north side, each thera to be surrounded by a group bearing the same name.  The king's wish was fulfilled; the theras in question and their companions were called Mahā Buddharakkhita, Mahā Dhammarakkhita, Mahā Sangharakkhita and Mahānanda.  As the king was about to mark the space to be covered by the cetiya, the Thera Siddhattha, looking into the future, told him to define only a moderate space for the Thūpa.  This the king did; then, looking at the theras immediately around him, he inquired their names and rejoiced to find them so auspicious, they being Siddhattha, Mangala, Sumam, Paduma, Sīvalī, Candagutta, Suriyagutta, Indagutta, Sāgara, Mittasena, Jayasena, and Acala.  He then laid the first foundation stone on the east side on sweet smelling clay prepared by Mittasena and sprinkled with water by Jayasena; Mahāsumana placed jasmine flowers on the stone.  Immediately the earth trembled in wonder.  The minister who helped the king to mark out the area of the cetiya was Suppatitthitabrahmā, son of Nandisena and Sumanadevī.  At the end of the ceremony, Piyadassī preached to the assembled populace, and many attained to various fruits of the Path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thūpa was like a water bubble in shape; its architect was Sirivaddha and his assistant Acala.  Orders were given that no unpaid work should be done in the construction of the cetiya.  Arahants caused the three terraces of flower offerings to the Thūpa (pupphādhānā) to sink nine times into the earth, in order, as they explained, to strengthen the foundations.  The cetiya was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and for the ten flower terraces alone ten crores of bricks were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Relic Chamber was of unparalleled magnificence, and consisted of four medavannapāsānā, each eighty cubits in length and in breadth and eight inches thick.  These were brought from Uttarakura by two sāmaneras, Uttara and Sumana.  In the Chamber were placed sculptural representations of the chief events connected with the Buddha's life as well as pictures of several Jātakas, including the Vessantara.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For list see Mhv.xxx.71ff.; the MT (549ff.) contains a long disquisition to prove that there is no reason to doubt the account given of the contents of the Relic Chamber, for in its construction the power (iddhi) of the king, of devas, and of arahants came into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of the Relic Chamber was under the personal supervision of Indagutta Thera, of great iddhi power.  When the Chamber was ready for the enshrining of the Relics, Sonuttara of Pūjā parivena was entrusted with the task of obtaining them.  In a previous birth, as Nanduttara, he had vowed to have the power of doing this, and now was his opportunity.  He went to Mañjerika Nāga bhavana, where the Relics, washed away from the Thūpa at Rāmagāma, were in the custody of the Nāga Mahākāla, and by a display of iddhi power obtained them from the Nāga against his desire.  They represented one dona of the Buddha's Relics, and the Buddha had predicted that they would ultimately be placed in the Mahā Thūpa.  These Relics were enshrined on the fifteenth uposatha day in the light half of the month of Āsālha, under the constellation of Uttarāsālha.  Many devas and brahmas and nāgas were present as on the day of the Buddha's Enlightenment, and ninety six crores of arahants attended the ceremony.  As the king, after passing three times round the cetiya, ascended it on the east side, and was about to descend into the Relic Chamber, bearing on his head the Casket of Relics, the casket opened and the Relics rose out of it, and taking on the form of the Buddha, performed the Twin Miracle, as at the foot of the Gandamba.  When the Relics were placed on the couch prepared for them they assumed, as the king had desired, the form of the Buddha as he lay on his death bed.  For a whole week the celebrations lasted, and during this period the king offered to the Relics the dominion of Ceylon, and Indagutta decreed that the people of Ceylon, wherever they might be, should be able immediately to visit the Thūpa should they desire to do so.  At the end of the seven days, the two sāmaneras, Uttara and Sumana, closed the Chamber with the medavannapāsānā set apart for the purpose, while arahants pronounced that flowers offered in the Relic Chamber should not wither, nor scents dry up; the lamps should not be extinguished nor anything whatever perish.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building of the Māha Thūpa is described in Mhv.  chaps xxviii-xxx.; MT. 514 83; Dpv.xix.1ff.; also Thūpavamsa (pp.  66ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treasures enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa were worth twenty crores, the rest cost one thousand crores (Mhv.xxxii.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the parasol of the Mahā Thūpa and the plaster work could be completed, Dutthagāmani fell ill, and his brother, Saddhātissa, summoned from Dīghavāpi, contrived with great skill to make the Thūpa look complete, that the king might see it before he died.  After the king's obsequies had been performed, in a place within sight of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.58), Saddhātissa finished the work yet remaining and established celebrations to be performed three times daily at the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxii.60; Mhv.xxxiii.5).  Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Mahā Thūpa and the Thūpārāma and built three stone terraces at the cost of three hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.22f).  Khallātanāga made the courtyard of sand, surrounded by a wall (Mhv.xxxiii.31).  Bhātika constructed two vedikā round the courtyard (Mhv.xxxiv.39).  It is said (MT. 553f) that Bhātika was taken by the arahants into the Relic Chamber, and he held great celebrations in its honour (see Bhātikābhaya).  Mahādāthika Mahānāga converted the sand courtyard into a wide court laid out with kiñcakkha stones on plaster (Mhv.xxxiv.69), while Amandagāmani erected a parasol over the cetiya (Mhv.xxxv.2) and Ilanāga made the Lambakannas construct a roadway leading up to the Mahā, Thūpa (Mhv.xxxiv.17).  Sirināga had the whole Thūpa gilded and crowned with a new parasol (Mhv.xxxvi.24), this work being undertaken again later by Sanghatissa (Mhv.xxxvi.65), while Sanghabodhi made rain to pour down by means of prostrating himself in the courtyard (Mhv.xxxvi.75).  Jetthatissa offered two precious gems to the Thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.126), while Aggabodhi I.  placed on the Thūpa a golden umbrella (Cv.xlii.32), From this time onward the country passed through very troublous times and the Mahā Thūpa was neglected.  But it was restored by Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxiv.10; lxxvi.106f; lxxviii.97) and again by Kittinissanka (Cv.lxxx.20); it was later pillaged by Māgha (Cv.lxxx.68), and remained neglected till the time of Parakkamabāhu II., who started the work of reconstruction (Cv.lxxxvii.66), which was completed by his son Vijayabāhu IV.  Cv.lxxxviii.83; after this, the cetiya once more fell into disrepair and has so continued till recently, when an attempt is being made to rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā Thūpa has been a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists from the time of its building down to the present day, even when the place was deserted and its courtyards overgrown with creepers (e.g., Vibhā.446).  There seems to have been a hall for pilgrims to the west of the cetiya (Vibhā.446).  When the Buddha's sāsana disappears, all the Relics of the Buddha deposited in various cetiyas all over Ceylon will gather together at the Mahācetiya, and from there will go to the Rajāyatana cetiya in Nāgadīpa, thence to the, Mahābodhipallanka, where all the Relics, assembled from everywhere, will take the form of the Buddha seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree.  Then they will be consumed by self generated flames (Vibhā.433).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā Thūpa is known by other names: Mahācetiya, Ratanavāluka (Cv.lxxvi.106), Ratanavāli (Cv.lxxx.68), Sonnamāli (Mhv.xxvii.3) (Hemamāli), and Hemavāluka (Cv.li.82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a number of monks staying in the Ambātakagrove in Macchikāsanda were entertained by Citta-gahapati to a sumptuous meal.  At the end of the meal, Citta, escorted them back to the monastery.  On the way the monks were overcome by the heat, and Mahaka, the junior monk, with the permission of his senior, made by his magic power a cool wind to blow and wrought a thunderstorm accompanied by gentle rain.  Citta was greatly impressed, and, seeking Mahaka in his cell, asked him to perform some miracle.  Mahaka told him to put his cloak on the veranda and to scatter a bundle of grass on it.  Then he retired to his cell, locked the door, and caused a flame to dart through the keyhole and burn the grass without damaging the cloak.

While begging for alms in the village, his mind was defiled by an unusual sight.  He therefore returned to the vihāra, but, even in his sleep, he was haunted by what he had seen, and, greatly agitated, he went to Mahāsangharakkhita and obtained from him a formula of meditation with which to counteract the lustful feelings.  With this formula he went into a thicket and lay on his pamsukūla robe and became an anāgāmī.  MA.i.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The Buddha does so, and adds that those who follow his teaching are sure of deliverance and of birth in happy worlds and are destined for Nibbāna.  Vacchagotta is very pleased and seeks admission to the Order, but the Buddha says that he must first pass four months as a probationer.  At the end of that time he enters the Order and the Buddha further expounds the Doctrine to him.  Shortly after he becomes an Arahant.  M.i.489 97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāmangala Jātaka (No.  453)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, called Rakkhita, was born in a wealthy brahmin family.  He married, and then, having distributed all his wealth, became an ascetic with five hundred followers.  During the rains, his disciples went to Benares and dwelt in the king's park, while Rakkhita stayed in the hermitage.  At that time there was a great discussion going on among men as to what constituted auspiciousness, and Rakkhita's disciples, on being consulted, said that Rakkhita would solve the problem.  They, therefore, went to Rakkhita's hermitage and asked him the question, which he answered in a series of eight verses.  (The mangalas enumerated in these verses differ from those given in the Mangala Sutta).  The disciples, having learnt the verses, returned to Benares, where they expounded them, thus setting all doubts at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mangala_s,Mahāmangala Sutta')"&gt;Mahāmangala Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  It happened that in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; there was a large assembly at the Santhāgāra, and a man rose and went out, saying, "This is a day of good omen." Some one, hearing this, inquired the meaning of "good omen." One said, "The sight of a lucky thing is a good omen." But this was denied, and then began the discussion on omens, which, in the end, was carried to Sakka, and referred by him to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior disciple of Rakkhita is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.72 9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some monks once visited a Paribbājakārāma near Sāvatthi and were told by the Paribbājakas that they, as well as the Buddha, understood how to transcend pleasures of sense, visible forms and feelings; what then was the difference between themselves and the Buddha.  The monks repeated this to the Buddha, who said that none save himself knew the satisfaction, the perils, and the deliverance which attend pleasures of sense, etc.; he then proceeded to explain the pleasures of the senses, the perils that attend them, and the deliverance there from, which is to shed all desire and appetite therefore.  It is the same with feelings.  M.i.83ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Mahāgallaka.&lt;/b&gt; A village in Dakkhinaesa of Ceylon where Sanghatissa once camped (Cv.xliv.3).  Dāthopatissa II.  gave the village to the Padhānaghara in the Kassapa vihāra.

Near by were the Tissamahārāma and the Anurārāma built by Subha.  It is first mentioned (Mhv.xxii.8) as the residence of Devānampiyatissa's younger brother, Mahānāga, who founded the Rohana dynasty, but, as a settlement, it probably dates back to the most ancient times.  Mahānāga built in it the Nāgamahā vihāra.  Mahātissa built the Mahāpāli Hall in Mahāgāma and attached to it the Dāthaggabodhi-parivena (Cv.xlv.42).  The Damilas (probably in the time of Mahīnda IV.) destroyed Mahāgāma, but the buildings were restored by Vijayabāhu I.  Cv.lx.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpurisa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a Great Being, destined to become either a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakka-vatti')"&gt;Cakka-vatti&lt;/a&gt; or a Buddha.  He carries on his person the following thirty two marks (&lt;b&gt;Mahāpurisalakkhanāni&lt;/b&gt;) (these are given at D.ii.17f.; iii.142ff.; M.ii.136f ): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;he has feet of level tread; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;on his soles are marks of wheels with spokes, felloes and hubs; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his heels project; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his digits are long; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his hands and feet are soft; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his fingers and toes straight; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his ankles like rounded shells; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his legs like an antelope's; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standing, he can touch his knees without bending; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his privacies are within a sheath; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he is of golden hue; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his skin so smooth that no dust clings to it; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the down on his body forms single hairs; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;each hair is straight, blue black and at the top curls to the right; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his frame is straight; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his body has seven convex surfaces; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his chest is like a lion's; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his back flat between the shoulders; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his sheath is the same as his height;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his bust is equally rounded; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his taste is consummate; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he has a lion's jaws; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;has forty teeth; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they are regular, and continuous; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lustrous; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his tongue is long; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his voice like that of a karavīka bird; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his eyes intensely black; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his eyelashes like a cows; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;between his eyelashes are soft, white hairs like cotton down; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his head is like a turban.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory of Mahāpurisa is pre Buddhistic.  Several passages in the Pitakas (E.g., D.i.89, 114, 120; A.i.163; M.ii.136; SN.vs.600, 1000, etc.) mention brahmins as claiming that this theory of the Mahāpurisa and his natal marks belonged to their stock of hereditary knowledge.  The Buddhists, evidently, merely adopted the brahmin tradition in this matter as in so many others.  But they went further.  In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lakkhana_s,Lakkhana Sutta')"&gt;Lakkhana Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.142ff) they sought to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present life by means of goodness.  Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the personification of human sacrifice.  Some are characteristic of human beauty, and one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own theory of the attributes of a Mahāpurisa as explained in the Mahāpurisa Sutta (S.v.158) and the Vassakāra Sutta (A.ii.35f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for the birth of a Buddha, the Suddhāvāsa Brahmās visit the earth in the guise of brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha.  On his death this knowledge generally vanishes.  He defines a Mahāpurisa as one who is great owing to his panidhi, samādāna, ñāna and karunā.  A Mahāpurisa can be happy in all conditions of climate.  DA.ii.794.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/a&gt; had three Mahāpurisalakkhanā; he could touch his forehead with his tongue, he had a mole between his eyebrows (unnā), and his privacies were contained within a sheath.

Mahānāga Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; The son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m1_mag,Madhuvāsettha')"&gt;Madhuvāsettha&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa,Sāketa')"&gt;Sāketa&lt;/a&gt;.  While the Buddha was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana,Añjanavana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt;, Mahānāga saw the wonder wrought by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gavampati,Gavampati')"&gt;Gavampati&lt;/a&gt; and entered the Order under him, attaining to arahantship in due course.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he had given a dādima (pomegranate) fruit to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakusandha,Kakusandha')"&gt;Kakusandha&lt;/a&gt; Buddha (ThagA.i.442f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several verses uttered by him in admonition of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa,Chabbaggiyā')"&gt;Chabbaggiyā&lt;/a&gt;, because of their failure to show regard for their co religionists, are found in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theragaathaa,Theragāthā')"&gt;Theragāthā&lt;/a&gt;.  Thag.vss.387-92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Mutasiva and viceroy of Devānampiyatissa.  His wife was Anulā, for whose ordination Sanghamittā came over from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xiv.56; Dpv.xi.6; xvii.75).  His second wife was a foolish woman who tried to poison him in order to get the throne for her son.  While he was building the Taraccha tank, she sent him some mangoes, the top one of which, intended for him, was poisoned.  But it was her son who ate the mango and died.  Mahānāga thereupon went to Rohana, where he founded the dynasty of that name at Mahāgāma.  His son was Yatthālayaka Tissa.  Mahānāga built the Nāgamahā vihāra and the Uddhakandara vihāra.  Mhv.xxii.2ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; A resident of Nitthulavitthika in Girijanapada.  He was the father of Gothaimbara.  Mhv.xxiii.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt;Son of Vattagāmanī.  He later came to be known as Coranāga.  Mhv.xxxiii.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; See Māhādāthika Mahānaga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Bhūtārāma.  As a mark of favour, Kanitthatissa built for him the Ratanapāsāda at Abhayagiri vihāra.  Mhv.xxxvi.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Samudda vihāra.  He was among those who accepted the gift of a meal by Prince Sāliya, in his birth as a blacksmith.  MT.  606.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kālavallimandapa.  He was among those who accepted the meal given by Sāliya in his previous birth (MT.  606).  He was one of the last to attain arahantship among those who left the world with the Bodhisatta in various births (J.iv.490).  He did not sleep for seven years, after which he practised continual meditation for sixteen years, becoming an arahant at the end of that time.  SNA.i.56; MA.i.209; SA.iii.155.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fame was great, and there is a story of a brahmin who came all the way from Pātaliputta to Kālavallimandapa in Rohana to visit him.  The brahmin entered the Order under him and became an arahant (AA.i.384).  Once, while Mahānāga was begging alms at Nakulanagara, he saw a nun and offered her a meal.  As she had no bowl, he gave her his, with the food ready in it.  After she had eaten and washed the bowl, she gave it back to him saying, "Henceforth there will be no fatigue for you when begging for alms." Thereafter the Elder was never given alms worth less than a kahāpana.  The nun was an arahant.  DhSA.399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Mahānāga Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Bhātiyavanka vihāra.  He received alms from Sāliya in his previous birth.  MT.  606.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Maddha(?) vihāra.  He was one of the last to become arahant among those who left the world with the Bodhisatta in various births.  J.vi.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He and his brother, Cūlanāga, householders of Vasālanagara, renounced the world and became arahants.  One day, while visiting their own village, they went to their mother's house for alms.  The mother, not quite sure who they were, asked if they were her sons.  But they, not wishing for any bonds of affection, gave an evasive reply.  SA.ii.125.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He lived in Uccatalanka (Uccavālika).  Talankavāsi Dhammadinna (q.v.) was his pupil and became an arahant through his intervention.  Vibhā.489; Vsm.634.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Mahānāga Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He once went to his mother's house for alms and while sitting there entered into trance.  The house caught fire and all the others fled.  When the fire was put out the Thera was discovered unhurt, and the villagers did him great honour.  Finding his attainments discovered, he rose into the air and went to Piyangudīpa.  Vsm.706.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; A king of Ceylon, mentioned in the Dhammasangani Commentary (DhSA.399).  While travelling to India from Ceylon he won the favour of an Elder, and on his return became king.  Out of gratitude he established gifts of medicine in Setambangana for as long as he lived.  (DhSA.399).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; Teacher of Sangharakkhitasāmanera (q.v.).  He was called Sāmuddika Mahānāga.  DA.ii.558.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Mahānāga.&lt;/b&gt; Nephew of Bhayasīva.  During a time of famine he sold his upper garment and obtained food for a man learned in magic spells.  The latter, in gratitude, took him to the Gokannasamudda, and there, having conjured up a Nāga, prophesied Mahānāga's future.  Mahānāga entered Silākāla's service, and was sent by him to collect revenue in Rohana.  Later he was made Andhasenāpati, and he established himself master of Rohana.  He once attempted to fight against Dāthāpabhuti, but soon gave up the attempt.  Taking advantage of the confusion in Kittisirimegha's dominions, Mahānāga advanced against him, killed him, and seized the throne.  Among his benefactions was the grant of the village of Jambalambaya to Uttara vihāra, Tintinika to Mahāvihira, and Vasabha in Uddhagāma to Jetavana vihāra, together with three hundred fields for the supply of rice soup.  He also gave Cīramātikavāra to Mahāvihāra and instituted a gift of rice soup.  He renovated the Mayūraparivena and Anurārāma in the Mahādevarattakuruva vihāra in Kāsikhanda.  He reigned for only three years (556-9 A.C.), and was succeeded by his nephew, Aggabodhi I.  (Cv.xli.69ff), who built a vihāra in his memory and assigned it to an Elder versed in the Tipitaka.  Cv.xlii.24; Cv.Trs.i.68, n.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Mahānāga&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Kontaratthakapabbata Vihāra.  He died seated in mid-air, and Kākavannatissa, having heard of it from a crow, paid him great honour.  Ras.ii.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Arittha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nephew of Devānampiyatissa.  He was the king's chief minister, and led the embassy which was sent to Asoka soon after Devānampiyatissa ascended the throne (Mhv.xi.20).  Asoka conferred on him the title of Senāpati (Mhv.xi.25).  It is said that he had fifty five elder and younger brothers who all joined the Order at Cetiyagiri at the end of a sermon by Mahinda on the Vassūpanāyikakhandha (Mhv.xvi.10).  This was before the commencement of the rainy season, but elsewhere (Mhv.xviii.3; perhaps here we have to deal with two different traditions) it is said that Arittha was sent in the month of Assayuja - after the pavārana, when the rains were over - to Pātaliputta to fetch Sanghamittā and the Bodhi tree from the court of Asoka, and that, he agreed to go only on condition that he should join the Order on his return.  The king consented, and, his mission successfully concluded, he entered the Order with five hundred others and attained arahantship (Mhv.xix.5, 12, 66).  He died in the reign of Uttiya (Mhv.xx.54).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.102ff) gives an account of a recital (sangīti) held in Ceylon by Mahā Arittha.  The scene was the parivena of the minister Meghavannābhaya in the Thūpārāma, where sixty eight thousand monks were assembled.  A seat, facing south, was provided for Mahinda, Arittha's seat, the dhammāsana, facing north.  Arittha occupied this seat at Mahinda's request, and sixty eight Mahā-theras, led by Mahinda, sat around him.  Devānampiyatissa's younger brother, Mattābhaya Thera, with five hundred others, were present in order to learn the Vinaya, the king also being present.  When Arittha began his recital of the Vinaya, many miracles occurred.  This was on the first day of the pavārana ceremony in the month of Kattika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahā Arittha's chief disciples were Tissadatta, Kālasumana and Dīghasumana (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā-atthakathā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest and most important of the Commentaries on the Tipitaka, brought, according to tradition, to Ceylon by Mahinda, who translated it into Singhalese (Cv.xxxvii.228f).  It thus came to be called the Sīhalatthakathā.  Besides exegetical material on the Pāli Canon, it contained also historical materials on which were later based the Pāli Chronicles, the Mahāvamsa and the Dīpavamsa.  For a description see Geiger's Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, pp.  44, 63, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā-atthakathā was the chief source from which Buddhaghosa drew his materials for his Commentaries and is often referred to in his works, particularly in the Samantapāsādikā.  E.g., Sp.i.2; ii.494; 265; iii.537, 616, 617, 627, 701, 716, 718, 726; iv.  744, 776, 783, 817, 863, 914, 923; DhSA.157; DA.i.180, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā-atthakathā was in charge of the monks of the Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura.  It was superseded by the Commentaries of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapāla and others, and is not now extant.  It is often referred to merely as Atthakathā.  E.g., VibhA.56, 155, 200, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsāropama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Gijjhakūta, soon after Devadatta's secession.  Some young men leave the household, being lured by the life of a monk.  As monks, they receive presents, esteem, and repute.  These things so please them and satisfy their aspirations that they become conceited and disparage others.  Thus they grow remiss and a prey to Ill.  Their case resembles that of a man who, needing the best of timber, goes into a forest and is satisfied with cutting off the leafy foliage or the bark of the trees, knowing nothing of the grades of wood.  On the other hand, the monk who is satisfied only when he reaches the end of Ill is like a man who takes only the choicest timber, passing over the other.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahākāla &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Mahākāla Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a merchant family of Setavyā, and, while on a journey to Sāvatthi with five hundred carts, he heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana and entered the Order.  He lived in the charnel field meditating, and, one day, the crematrix Kālā, noticing him, arranged the limbs of a recently cremated body near the Thera that he might gaze at them.  With these as a topic of meditation, he soon became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thag.vss.151f.; his story is given in much greater detail at DhA.i.66ff.; there he is said to have been the eldest of three brothers, of whom the others were Majjhimakāla and Cūlakāla.  He went with the latter to Sāvatthi, where both of them joined the Order.  After becoming an arahant, Mahākāla went with the Buddha to Setavyā and dwelt in the Simsapā grove, Cūlakāla accompanying him.  Cūlakāla's wives invited the Buddha and the other monks to a meal, and he himself went on earlier to make arrangements.  His wives disrobed him.  At the end of the meal, Mahākāla was left behind by the Buddha to make the thanksgiving.  His eight wives surrounded him and stripped him of his robes, but, knowing their intention, he disappeared through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago, while wandering near the mountain Urugana, he saw the rag robe of an ascetic and offered three kinkinika flowers in its honour (ThagA.i.271f).  He is probably identical with Pamsukūlapūjaka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.434; but see ThagA.i.79, where the same Apadāna verses are quoted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Mahākāla&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An upāsaka of Savatthi who was a sotāpanna.  One day he took the uposatha vows and, having listened throughout the night to the preaching, was washing his face in the pool near Jetavana early the next morning, when thieves who had broken into a house and were being pursued put their stolen goods near him and ran away.  He, being taken for a thief, was beaten to death.  When this was reported to the Buddha, he related a story of the past in which Mahākāla had been a forest guard of the king of Benares.  One day he saw a man entering the forest road with his beautiful wife and, falling in love with the wife, invited them to his house.  He then had a gem placed in the man's cart, and the latter was beaten to death as a thief.  DhA.iii.149ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Mahākāla&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Naga king who dwelt in the Mañjerika Nāgabhavana.  When the Buddha, after eating the meal given by Sujātā, launched the bowl up stream, it travelled a short way and then stopped, having reached the Nāga's abode under the Nerañjarā, and then came into contact with the bowls similarly launched by the three previous Buddhas of this kappa.  To the Nāga because of his long life it seemed that the previous Buddha had died only the preceding day, and he rejoiced to think that another had been born.  He went therefore to the scene of the Buddha's Enlightenment with his Nāga maidens and they sang the Buddha's praises.  J.i.70, 72; this incident is among those sculpturally represented in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxxi.83); see also Dvy.392; Mtu.ii.265, 302, 304. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kāla's life span was one kappa; therefore he saw all the four Buddhas of this kappa, and when Asoka wished to see the form of the Buddha, he sent for Mahākāla, who created for him a beautiful figure of the Buddha, complete in every detail (Mhv.v.87f.; Sp.i.43, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha's relics, deposited at Rāmagāma, were washed away, Mahākāla took the basket containing them into his abode and there did them honour till they were removed, against his will, by Sonuttara.  Mhv.xxxi.25ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahākāla.  &lt;/b&gt; A householder of Bandhumati in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  He was a previous birth of Aññā-Kondañña.  He and his brother Cūlakāla gave the first fruits of their harvest, in nine stages of its growth, to the Buddha.  AA.i.79ff.; ThagA.ii.1f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahākāla.&lt;/b&gt; One of the seven mountains surrounding Gandhamādana.  SNA.i.66; J.v.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahālatā pasādhana (-pilandhana)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very costly ornament of gold.  In the time of the Buddha it was possessed only by three persons: Bandhula's wife, Mallikā, Visākhā and Devadāniyacora (DA.ii.599; at DhA.i.412 the daughter of the treasurer of Benares is substituted for Devadāniya).  Visākhā once left it behind in the monastery, where she had gone to hear the Buddha preach, and when she sent her slave girl for it Ananda had already put it away.  She, thereupon, refused to take it back and had it sold.  It was worth nine crores, the workmanship being worth one hundred thousand.  No one was found able to buy it, so Visākhā herself paid the price for it, and, with the proceeds, erected the Migāramātupāsāda (DhA.i.411ff).  Mallikā, after the death of her husband, refused to wear her jewels, and, when the Buddha's body was being taken for cremation, she washed her ornament in scented water and placed it on the Buddha's bier with the following resolve: " May I, in future births, have a body that shall need no ornaments, but which shall appear as though it always bore them (DA.ii.597).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The making of Visākhā's ornament took four months, with five hundred goldsmiths working day and night.  In its construction were used four pint pots (nāli) of diamonds, eleven of pearls, twenty two of coral, thirty three of rubies, one thousand nikkhas of ruddy gold, and sufficient silver.  The thread work was entirely of silver, the parure was fastened to the head and extended to the feet.  In various places, seals of gold and dies of silver were attached to hold it in position.  In the fabric itself was a peacock with five hundred feathers of gold in either wing, a coral beak, jewels for the eyes, the neck feathers and the tail.  As the wearer walked the feathers moved, producing the sound of music.  Only a woman possessed of the strength of five elephants could wear it.  DbA.i.393ff.  MA.i.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahānāgahula, Mahānāgasula, Mahānāgakula&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town in Rohana in Dvādasasahassakarattha.  It is first mentioned in the account of the campaigns of Vijayabāhu I (Cv.lviii.39).  His ādipāda, Vikkamabāhu, made it his capital and lived there (Cv.lx.90), as did Kittisirimegha, brother of Mānābharana (Cv.lxi.23).  Later, Sirivallabha lived there with his queen Ratnāvalī, her two daughters and the young Parakkamabāhu (Cv.lxiii.4).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Parakkamabāhu became king as Parakkamabāhu I., he wished to bring the city under his power, and sent Damilādhikarī Rakkha and Rakkha Kañcukināyaka to subdue it.  This they did only after much difficulty, owing to the severe resistance of the rebels of Rohana.  After its capture, Damilādhikāri Rakkha held a great festival in celebration of his victory, and the place was made the headquarters of Parakkamabāhu's forces in Rohana.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvedalla Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of questions asked by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita,Mahā Kotthita')"&gt;Mahā Kotthita&lt;/a&gt; on psychological topics &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- e.g., understanding, consciousness, feeling, perception, pure mental consciousness (manoviññāna), isolated from the five faculties of bodily sense - the eye of understanding, right outlook, types of rebirth, first &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhāna')"&gt;jhāna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, etc.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta's&lt;/a&gt; answers thereto (M.i.292 8).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was probably originally compiled rather as a "lesson" for learners than as a genuine enquiry by Kotthita.  This sutta it was which obtained for Kotthita the rank of pre eminence among those possessing the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/patisambhidaa,patisambhidā')"&gt;patisambhidā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  AA.i.159.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;1. Mahānāma Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and, after hearing the Buddha preach, entered the Order.  Taking a formula of meditation, he dwelt on the hill called Nesādaka.  Unable to prevent the rising of evil thoughts, he was disgusted with himself, and climbing a steep crag, made as if to throw himself down, and evoking insight became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedhā Buddha he was a brahmin teacher skilled in the Vedas, and the Buddha visited him in his hermitage on the banks of the Sindhū and was given honey by him (ThagA.vs.115; ThagA.i.227ff).  Mahānāma is probably identical with Madhudāyaka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.325f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Mahānāma Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya,Pañcavaggiyā')"&gt;Pañcavaggiyā&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.82).  He became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt; on the third day after the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana,Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  He became an arahant on the day of the preaching of the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anattalakhana_s,Anattalakkhana Sutta')"&gt;Anattalakkhana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, together with the other Pañcavaggiyā (AA.i.84; MA.i.390).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma once visited Macchikāsanda, and there Cittagahapati, seeing him beg for alms and pleased with his bearing, invited him to his house, gave him a meal, and listened to a sermon by him.  Citta was greatly pleased, and offered his pleasure garden of Ambātakavana to Mahānāma as a gift to the Order and built there a great monastery.  DhA.ii.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  Mahānāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya,Sākiyan')"&gt;Sākiyan&lt;/a&gt; rājā, son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/amitodana,Amitodana')"&gt;Amitodana&lt;/a&gt;; he was elder brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; and cousin of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  When the Sākiyan families of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; sent their representatives to join the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma allowed Anuruddha to leave the household, he knowing nothing of household affairs.  Vin.ii.180f.; DhA.i.133; iv.124, etc.; but according to Northern sources (Rockhill, p.  13) he was son of Dronodana; according to ThagA.  (ii.123) Ananda was a brother (or, at least, a step brother) of Mahānāma, for there Ananda's father is given as Amitodana.  But see MA.i.289, where Mahānāma's father is called Sukkodana and Ananda's Amitodana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma showed great generosity to the Sangha, and was proclaimed best of those who gave choice alms to the monks (A.i.26).  Once, with the Buddha's permission, he supplied the Order with medicaments for three periods of four months each.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa,Chabbaggiyā')"&gt;Chabbaggiyā&lt;/a&gt;, always intent on mischief, tried in vain to discourage him.  Vin.iv.101; AA.  (i.213) adds that this was during the period of want experienced by the Buddha and his monks at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa,Verañjā')"&gt;Verañjā&lt;/a&gt;.  At the end of the year, Mahānāma wished to continue the supply of good food to the Buddha and his monks, but the Buddha refused his permission.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma was a devoted follower of the Buddha and wished to understand the Doctrine.  The books record several conversations between him and the Buddha, and Ananda, Godha, and Lomasavangīsa (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanama_s,Mahānāma Sutta')"&gt;Mahānāma Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lomasa_vangisa,Lomasavangisa')"&gt;Lomasavangisa&lt;/a&gt;).  Once when the Buddha arrived at Kapilavatthu he asked Mahānāma to find him lodging for the night.  Mahānāma tried everywhere without success, and finally suggested that the Buddha should spend the night in the hermitage of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bharandukalama,Bharandu Kālāma')"&gt;Bharandu Kālāma&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.327f).  This he did, and was joined there the next morning by Mahānāma; as a result of the discussion between the Buddha, Mahānāma and Bharandu, the last-named left Kapilavatthu never to return.  On another occasion, Mahānāma visited the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigrodharama,Nigrodhārāma')"&gt;Nigrodhārāma&lt;/a&gt; where the Buddha was convalescing after a severe illness, and at once Mahānāma asked a question as to whether concentration followed or preceded knowledge.  Ananda, who was present, not wishing the Buddha to be troubled, took Mahānāma aside and explained to him the Buddha's teachings on the subject.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkaa_sutta,Sakka Sutta')"&gt;Sakka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.219f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma had a daughter &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasabhakkhattiyaa,Vāsābhakhattiyā')"&gt;Vāsābhakhattiyā&lt;/a&gt;, born to him by a slave-girl named Nāgamundā, and when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; asked the Sākiyans to give him in marriage a Sākiyan maiden they met in the Mote Hall, and, following the advice of Mahānāma, sent Vāsabhakhattiyā to him.  In order to allay any suspicions, Mahānāma sat down to a meal with her, taking one mouthful from the same dish; but before he could swallow it a messenger arrived, as secretly arranged, and summoned him away.  He left, asking Vāsabhakhattiyā to continue her meal (DhA.i.345f.; J.i.133; iv.  145f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_dukkhakkhandha_s,Cūla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta')"&gt;Cūla Dukkhakkhandha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sekha_sutta,Sekha Sutta')"&gt;Sekha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, both preached to Mahānāma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resolve to attain to eminence as the best distributor of pleasant food to the monks was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He was then a householder of Hamsavatī and heard the Buddha confer a similar rank on a monk (AA.i.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma is included in a list of exemplary lay devotees (A.iii.451).  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samantapaasaadikaa,Samantapāsādikā')"&gt;Samantapāsādikā&lt;/a&gt; (Sp.iv.857) adds that Mahānāma was one month older than the Buddha and that he was a sakadāgāmī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Mahānāma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Licchavi.  One day while walking about in the Mahāvana in Vesāli he saw some young Licchavis paying homage to the Buddha and accused them of inconsistency.  For details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_s,Kumāra Sutta')"&gt;Kumāra Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.75ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Mahānāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon.  He was the younger brother of Upatissa II.  and was for some time a monk, but he carried on an intrigue with Upatissa's wife, and she killed her husband.  Then Mahānāma became a layman, assumed the sovereignty, and married Upatissa's queen.  He built refuges for the sick, enlarged the Mahāpāli Hall, and erected the Lohadvāra , Ralaggāma, and Kotipassāvana vihāras, which he gave to the monks of Abhayagiri.  A vihāra which he built on the Dhūmarakkha mountain, he gave, at the instigation of his queen, to the monks of Mahāvihāra.  He ruled for twenty two years (409 31 A.C.).  It was during his reign that Buddhaghosa arrived in Ceylon and wrote his Commentaries, dwelling in a vihāra given by the king.  Cv.xxxvii.209ff.; see also P.L.C.  96. The king seems to have also been called Sirinivāsa and Sirikudda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Mahānāma Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incumbent of Dīghasanda (or Dīghāsana) Vihāra (Cv.xxxix.42).  He is generally identified with the uncle of Dhātusena mentioned elsewhere (Cv.xxxviii.16).  Moggallāna I.  built for him the Pabbata vihāra (Cv.xxxix.42).  Mahānāma is generally regarded as the author of the older part of the Mahāvamsa.  MT.  687; e.g., in Gv.61, 66; Svd.1266; for a discussion on this see P.L.C.139ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Mahānāma Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author of the Saddhammappakāsanī Commentary on the Patisambhidāmagga (Gv.61; Svd.1196).  The colophon to the book (PSA.526) states that he lived in the Uttaramanti parivena in the Mahāvihāra and finished his work in the third year after the death of Moggallāna (probably Moggallāna I.).  The Gandhavamsa (Gv.70) says that the work was written at the request of an upāsaka, also named Mahānāma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Mahānāma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Mahānanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Mahānāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lake in Nāgadīpa.  Near it was the Mucalinda-vana.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpaduma Jātaka (No.  472)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Mahāpaduma, son of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  When Paduma's mother died, his father took another wife.  On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising, and, thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him, he entrusted her to the care of Paduma.  The campaign was victorious.  In the course of making arrangements for the celebration of his father's return, Paduma entered the queen's apartments.  She was struck by his amazing beauty, and fell in love with him, inviting him to lie with her.  On his indignant refusal, she feigned illness, and, on the return of the king, falsely accused him of having ill treated her.  The king gave orders, in spite of the protestations of the people, that Paduma should be thrown from the "Robbers' Cliff." The deity of the mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nāga king, who took him to his abode, where he stayed for one year.  Paduma then went to the Himālaya and became an ascetic.  The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom, but it was refused by Paduma.  The king, convinced of the falsity of the charge brought against Paduma, caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers' Cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Ciñcamānavikā's false accusations against the Buddha.  Ciñcā was the wicked queen, Devadatta the king, Sāriputta the deity, and Ananda the Nāga.  J.iv.187 96; DhA.iii.181ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāgovinda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcasikha visits the Buddha at Gijjhakūta and tells him of a meeting once held in Tāvatimsa.  At this meeting Sakka rejoices with the devas of Tāvatimsa over the increase in their numbers owing to the appearance in their midst of new devas produced by the good kamma of the followers of the new view of life put forward by the Buddha.  Sakka expresses his joy in a song and then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha.  Brahmā Sanankumāra appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his benefit.  Sanankumāra says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the story of Disampati and his son Renu.  Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints Govinda's son Jotipāla in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with Jotipāla's help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being Dantapura, Potana, Māhissati, Roruka, Mithilā, Campā and Bārānasi; and the kings, respectively, are: Sattabhū, Brahmadatta, Vessabhū, Bharata, Renu and two Dhataratthas.  Jotipāla, now called Mahāgovinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of stewards to the seven kings.  Mahāgovinda acquires the reputation of having seen Brahmā face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of Renu and practises meditation for four months.  During his meditation, Sanankumāra appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahmā face to face and attain communion with him.  Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal brahmin.  Mahāgovinda decides to leave the world and carry out the teachings of Sanankumāra.  Having obtained the leave of his master, he enters the homeless life, where he practises the four ecstasies of love, pity, sympathy in joy and equanimity.  He teaches these to his disciples, and, after death, they are all born into the Brahma world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Pañcasikha's recital, the Buddha tells him that he himself was Mahāgovinda and therefore remembers all that life.  D.ii.220 51; cp.  Janavasabha Sutta, also Mtu.iii.197ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, brahmacariyā is explained as the four infinities (appamaññā), infinite love, etc.  DA.i.178; MA.i.275.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Aggabodhi I.  built the Bhinnorudīpa vihāra and gave it, with endowments, to an incumbent of the Mahāparivena (Cv.xlii.26) while Aggabodhi VII.  enlarged the parivena by the addition of a pāsāda (Cv.xlviii.65).

Mahāsona.&lt;/b&gt; One of the ten chief warriors of Dutthagāmanī.  He was born in Hunadarīvāpī in the Kulumbarī district as the eighth son of a man named Tissa.  He was as strong as ten elephants, and took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura.

Mahāsona.&lt;/b&gt; A monk in the time of Vattagāmani Abhaya.  During the troubles caused by the brigand Brāhmanatissa, he travelled about in the company of Isidatta Thera, maintaining themselves on whatever they could find.  One day a maiden made three balls of food, gave one to Isidatta, the second to Mahāsona, and wished to give the third to Isidatta; but her hand turned, and the food fell into Mahāsona's bowl.  Later, he lived with five hundred others in Mandalārāma vihāra.  One day, while in Kālakagāma for alms, they were entertained by a pious devotee.  The latter asked for Mahāsona and showed him special honour, though Mahāsona was only a junior monk.  Some time after, Mahāsona returned to the Mahāvihāra in Anurādhapura and received many gifts, which he distributed among the Sangha.  Vibhā.446ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsuññatā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu.  The Buddha was staying in the cell erected by Kālakhemaka, and near by, in the cell erected by Ghatāya, Ananda, with many monks, was making robes.  The Buddha knew from the number of pallets outside the cells of Kālakhemaka that many monks were in residence there.  He therefore addressed Ananda, telling him of the joys of tranquility and solitude.  A monk should dwell apart and concentrate his heart internally and thus develop the four jhānas.  He then knows that, whatever his posture, he will be free from evil dispositions; his speech will be free from faults, his thoughts pure.  A monk should always search his heart to discover if he has any traffic with pleasures of sense.  A disciple should follow his master's footsteps, not in order to obtain interpretations of canonical law, but solely to hear words which conduce to passionless ness, illumination, Nibbāna (M.iii.109 18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is also called Ganabheda, because it tends to break up crowds.  Once, in the Vālikapitthi vihāra, Abhidhammika Abhaya recited this sutta with several others, and, understanding its import, dwelt apart and attained arahantship during the rains.  MA.ii.907.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahārāhulovāda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha and Rāhula are on their way to the village for alms, and the Buddha tells Rāhula that all rūpa should be regarded as anattā, and not only rūpa, but also the other khandhas.  Rāhula stops and sits under a tree meditating.  Sāriputta approaches and suggests that he should develop ānāpānasati.  Later in the evening Rāhula asks the Buddha how he can do this.  The Buddha describes how it is done by regarding all the elements earth, water, fire, air and space, both personal and external with disgust and loathing of heart.  One should not allow sensory impressions to lay hold of one's heart, just as the earth remains impassive whatever may be thrown upon it.  It is so with the other elements.  One should grow in loving-kindness, compassion, in gladness over the welfare of others, in equanimity, contemplation of the body's corruption, perception of the fleeting nature of things, and in the mindfulness which comes from ordered breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.i.420 6; it is perhaps a part of this sutta which is quoted at Mil.  385, 388; see Mil.  Trs.ii.312, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāphussadeva Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally called Alindakavāsī Mahāphussadeva.  For twenty one years he practised meditation on his way up and down to the village for alms (gatapaccāgatikavatta).  People working in the fields, seeing him constantly stop and walk back again, would wonder why he did so.  But he did not heed their curiosity, and after twenty years he became an arahant.  That night the deity at the end of his walk illuminated it with the radiance of her fingers, and Sakka, Brahmā, and other gods came to do him honour.  His colleague, Vanavāsī Mahātissa, asked him the next day the reason for all the light, but he evaded the question (SA.iii.154f.; Vibhā.352; MA.i.208f; SNA.i.55f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.i.524) that during the period of his meditations, he wept every pavārana day to see that he was yet a "learner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāli&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavi')"&gt;Licchavi&lt;/a&gt; chief, mentioned as having visited the Buddha at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa,Kūtāgārasālā')"&gt;Kūtāgārasālā&lt;/a&gt; to ask if he had seen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; (S.i.230; DhA.i.263ff.  add that the Buddha here related to him the story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magha,Magha')"&gt;Magha&lt;/a&gt;) and also to beg information as to the teachings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa,Pūrana Kassapa')"&gt;Pūrana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; (S.iii.68).  This conversation resulted from Mahāli having heard the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  (See&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahali_s,Mahāli Sutta')"&gt;Mahāli Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāli was educated at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;.  After his return to Vesāli, he devoted himself to the education of the young Licchavi men, but, through overexertion, lost his sight.  He continued to instruct them, however, and was given a house by the gate, which led from Sāvatthi into Vesāli.  The revenue from this gate, worth one hundred thousand, was given to him (DhA.i.338).  When Bandhula came to Vesāli, to satisfy the pregnancy longings of his wife Mallikā, Mahāli, hearing the rumble of his chariot, instantly recognised it.  He warned the Licchavis not to interfere with Bandhula, and, finding that they insisted on pursuing him, urged them to turn back when they saw Bandhula's chariot sink up to the nave, or at least when they heard a, sound like the crash of a thunderbolt, or when they saw a hole in the yokes of the chariot.  But they paid no heed to his warnings and were killed (DhA.i.350f.; J.iv.148f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Licchavis decided to invite the Buddha to Vesāli, to rid the city of its plagues, Mahāli it was who went with the son of the purohita to Veluvana to intercede with Bimbisāra, that he might persuade the Buddha to come.  Mahāli was a favourite of Bimbisāra and a member of his retinue.  He had attained sotāpatti at the same time as the king (DhA.iii.438).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Mahāli is perhaps identical with the Mahāli mentioned in the Apadāna (Ap.ii.494, vs.28) as the father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii,Sīvalī')"&gt;Sīvalī&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvamsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great Chronicle of Ceylon.  The first part of the work- i.e., to the time of King Mahāsena - is attributed to Mahānāma Thera (MT.687).  The continuation of the Chronicle is called the Cūlavamsa.  The first portion of the Cūlavamsa - i.e., from Mahāsena to the reign of Parakkamabāhu II.  - is traditionally ascribed to a thera named Dhammarakkhita (Cv.  Trs.ii.155, n.3).  The next section - i.e., to the time of Kittisiri Rājasīha - was written by Tibbatuvāve Thera, Mahānāyaka of Pupphārāma, at the invitation of the king, who obtained for him copies of the Chronicle from Siam (Cv.xcix.78f; Cv.Trs.ii.263, n.1).  From there it was continued till the time of the British occupation (1815 A.C.) by Hikkaduve Sumangala Thera (P.L.C.310).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Commentary on the Mahāvamsa called the Vamsatthappakāsinī (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsena-Vihāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vihāra called after King Mahāsena, to which Aggabodhi V.  gave the village of Pannabhatta (Cv.xlviii.8; Cv.Trs.i.111, n.  1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vihāra was a Buddha image, and Sena II.  granted it a village and appointed watchmen to look after it.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsāla Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsāla Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A rich brahmin asks the Buddha why there is an apparent decrease of human beings.  The Buddha answers that it is because the world is ablaze with unlawful lusts, wrong doctrines, and depraved longings.  There is no reasonable rain, harvests are poor, and men die easily.  A.i.159f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsāla or Lūkhapāpurana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A wealthy brahmin, looking worn and wearing a coarse garment, visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and tells him that his four sons, aided by their wives, have shown him the door.  The Buddha teaches him several verses illustrating the ingratitude of his sons to be recited in the Santhāgārasālā.  He recited these and his sons, who are in the assembly, take him home and look after him.  Later he goes to the Buddha and asks him to accept a set of garments which his sons have given him.  The Buddha accepts it out of compassion (S.i.175f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that the man had immense wealth in his house, some eighty crores.  He found wives for his sons and divided half his wealth among them.  His wife died, and his sons, fearful lest he should marry again and they should lose the rest of their patrimony, pet him and look after him, and he gives them all except his wrap.  He goes to live with his eldest son, but is driven out by his daughter in law; the rest of the family treats him likewise.  He enters the order of the Pandarangas and suffers the greatest privations, till he finally throws himself on the reputed kindness and graciousness of the Buddha.  When the people discover the disloyalty of the sons they threaten to kill them, and then the sons take the old man back and nurse him.  Later the members of the family become sotāpannas.

She was the daughter of King Subha, and was given to a friend of his, a brick worker, who adopted her as his daughter.  She used to bring him food at midday.  One day, seeing an ascetic in a kadamba thicket, she gave him the food.  The brick worker was glad, and asked her to give food regularly to the monk, who prophesied that she would be the queen, and asked her not to forget the kadamba thicket.  She had auspicious signs on her body, on account of which she was chosen to be the wife of Vankanāsika.  She later remembered the thera's words and built a vihāra on the site of the kadamba thicket.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsammata&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king who lived in the beginning of this present age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pāli Chronicles (Mhv.ii.1ff.; Dpv.iii.1ff.; MT.  122ff.; also J.ii.311; iii.454, etc.) mention him as the original ancestor of the Sākiyan family, to which the Buddha belonged, and gives a list of the dynasties from his day to the time of the Buddha, to prove that the line was "unbroken." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāsammata belonged to the Solar Race and is identified with the Bodhisatta, who was born among men after sojourn in the Brahma worlds (MT.  121 f).  He was called Mahāsammata, because, on the arising of wickedness in the world, he was chosen by the people (sannipatitvā samaggajātehi mahājanchi sammannitvā kato Mahāsammato; MT.122; cp.  D.iii.92f.; Mtu.i.248; DhSA.  390, 392) to show indignation against and disapproval of those worthy of blame.  In return for his services, he was given a portion of their harvest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (J.iv.192) that in the dynasty of Mahāsammata the idea of meting out punishments, such as torture, fining, expulsion, was unknown.  These were invented later &lt;b&gt;with the advance of civilisation!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vimānavatthu Commentary (p.15) explains that Mahāsammata is the name given in the sacred books (sāsane) for Manu.  Some, at least, of the Ceylon kings traced their descent from Mahāsammata.  See, e.g., Cv.xlvii.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāparivāra Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a Yakkha chief and, seeing the Buddha enter Bandhumatī with a large following of monks, offered his upper garment and worshipped him.  The earth trembled with the force of his wish.  Fifteen kappas ago he was king sixteen times under the name of Vāhana (Ap.i.146f).  He is probably identical with Pakkha Thera.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāhamsa Jātaka (No.  534)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemā, wife of Samyama, king of Benares, had a dream, after which she longed to see a golden hamsa preach the law from the royal throne.  When the king came to know this, he consulted various people, and, acting on their advice, had a pond dug to the north of the city in the hope of enticing a golden hamsa there, and appointed a fowler, who came to be called Khemaka, to look after the pond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan succeeded.  Five different kinds of geese came: the grass geese, the yellow geese, the scarlet geese, the white geese, and the pāka geese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhatarattha, king of the golden geese, who lived in Cittakūta, had taken as wife a pakā goose, and at the repeated suggestion of his minister, Sumukha, arrived with his flock of ninety thousand, to see the wonderful pond at Benares.  Khemaka saw them and waited his opportunity.  On the seventh day he found it, and set a snare in which Dhatarattha was caught.  At his cry of alarm the flock fled, with the exception of Sumukha, who stayed and asked Khemaka for permission to take Dhatarattha's place.  When Sumukha heard why they had been caught, he asked that both he and Dhatarattha should be taken before Samyama.  When Samyama heard of Sumukha's devotion he was greatly touched, and showed the hamsas every possible honour, after asking their forgiveness for the way they had been treated.  Dhatarattha preached to the queen and the royal household, and, having exhorted the king to rule righteously, returned to Cittakūta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda's attempt to sacrifice his own life for that of the Buddha, when Nālāgiri (q.v.) was sent to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemaka was Channa, Khemā the Therī Khemā, the king Sāriputta, Sumukha Ananda, and Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta.  J.v.354 82; cp.  Cullahamsa Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Ummagga Jātaka (No.  546)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in Mithilā as the son of Sirivaddhaka and Sumanādevi.  The child was born with a medicinal plant in his hand, and was therefore called Mahosadha.  He talked immediately after birth, and it is said that, on the day of his conception, Videha, king of Mithilā, dreamed a dream, which presaged the birth of a sage.  From early childhood Mahosadha gave evidence of unusual ability, and one of his first acts was to build a large hall and lay out a garden with the help of his companions.  The king wished to have him in the court though he was only seven years old, but was dissuaded by his wise men.  But he sent a councillor to watch the boy and report of his doings from time to time.  When the king was fully convinced (the Jātaka gives an account of nineteen problems solved by Mahosadha) that Mahosadha was undoubtedly endowed with unusual wisdom, he sent for him in spite of the counsel of his ministers - Senaka, Pukkusa, Kāvīnda and Devinda- and appointed him as his fifth councillor.  One day, Mahosadha saved the queen Udumbarā (q.v.) from the unjust wrath of the king, and ever after she was his firm and loyal friend.  After his entry into the court, Mahosadha was on many occasions called upon to match his wit against that of the senior councillors, and on each occasion he emerged triumphant.  E.g., in the Mendakapañha (q.v.) and the Sirimandapañha (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When aged sixteen he married Amarādevī.  She was a wise woman, and frustrated many attempts of Mahosadha's enemies to embroil him with the king.  Once they stole various things from the palace and sent them to her.  She accepted them, and made assignations with each of the donors.  When they arrived she had them seized, their heads shaved, and themselves thrown into the jakes, where she tormented them, and then arraigned them before the king with the stolen goods.  Mahosadha, aware of the plots against him, lay in hiding, and the deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, knowing that none but Mahosadha could answer them.  The king sent men to seek him, and he was discovered working for a potter.  The king showed him all honour, and obtained from him the answers to the deity's questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his enemies continued to plot against him, until orders were given by the king that he should be killed the next day.  Udumbarā, discovered this and warned him.  But in the meantime he had discovered the guilty secrets of his enemies: Senaka had killed a courtesan, Pukkusa had a leprous spot on his thigh, Kāvinda was possessed by a yakkha named Naradeva, and Devinda had stolen the king's most precious gem.  Mahosadha posted these facts everywhere in the city, and the next day went boldly into the palace.  The king professed innocence of any evil intentions against him; but Mahosadha exposed the schemes of them all, and Senaka and the others were only saved from severe punishment by the intervention of Mahosadha himself.  Thenceforward Mahosadha was Videha's trusted councillor, and took various measures to increase his royal master's power and glory.  Spies were sent to every court, whence they brought home reports.  Mahosadha also had a parrot whom he employed to ferret out the most baffling secrets.  While returning from a visit to Sankhapala, king of Ekabala, the parrot passed through Uttarapañcāla and there overheard a conversation between Cūlani Brahmadatta, king of Kampilla, and his purohita Kevatta, wherein the latter unfolded a scheme for capturing the whole of Jambudīpa.  Kevatta was too wise to allow Brahmadatta, to attack Mithilā, knowing of Mahosadha's power, but Mahosadha deliberately provoked Brahmadatta by sending his men to upset a feast he had prepared, during which he had planned to poison the hundred princes whom he had brought under subjection.  Brahmadatta then set out to attack Mithilā.  He laid siege to the city, and adopted various ways of compelling the citizens to surrender.  But Mahosadha was more than a match for him, and found means of defeating all his plans.  In the end Mahosadha engaged the services of Anukevatta, who, pretending to be a traitor to Mithilā, went over to the army of Brahmadatta and, gaining the king's confidence, informed him that Kevatta and all the other counsellors of Brahmadatta had accepted bribes from Mahosadha.  The king listened to him, and on his advice raised the siege and fled to his own city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kevatta planned revenge, and, a year later, he persuaded Brahmadatta to send poets to Videha's city, singing songs of the peerless beauty of the daughter of Brahmadatta, Pañcālacandī.  Videha heard the songs and sent a proposal of marriage, and Kevatta came to Mithilā to arrange the day.  Videha suggested that Kevatta should meet Mahosadha to discuss the plans, but Mahosadha feigned illness, and when Kevatta arrived at his house, he was grossly insulted by Mahosadha's men.  When Kevatta had left, Videha consulted Mahosadha, but would not be dissuaded from his plan to marry Pañcālacandī.  Finding that he could do nothing with the king, Mahosadha sent his parrot Matthara to find out what he could from the maynah bird which lived in Brahmadatta's bedchamber.  Matthara used all his wits and won the favour of the maynah and learnt from her of Kevatta's plan, which he repeated to Mahosadha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Videha's leave, Mahosadha went on Uttarapañcāla to, as he said, make preparations for the wedding.  But he gave orders for a village to be built on every league of ground along the road, and gave instructions to the shipwright, Anandakumāra, to build and hold ready three hundred ships.  At Uttarapañcāla he was received with great honour, and obtained the king's permission to build in the city a palace for Videha.  The king gave him a free hand, and be immediately started to threaten to pull down houses belonging to various people, from the queen mother downwards, and obtained money from them as bribes to spare their houses.  Having reported to the king that no suitable spot was available within the city, he obtained his consent to erect a palace outside the city, between that and the Ganges.  All access was forbidden to the site on penalty of a large sum, and having first erected a village called Gaggali for his workmen, elephants, etc., Mahosadha started to dig a tunnel, the mouth of which was in the Ganges.  The tunnel, a marvellous place, was duly constructed, fitted with all manner of machinery, and beautifully decorated.  A smaller tunnel was dug, leading into the larger, one opening, which was, however, concealed, giving access to the king's palace.  The task occupied four months, and when all preparations were complete, Mahosadha sent word to Videha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videha arrived at Brahmadatta's court, and a great feast was held in his honour at Upakārī, the palace which had been prepared for his residence.  While the feast was in progress, Mahosadha sent men by the smaller tunnel to the palace and bade them fetch Talatā (the queen mother), the queen Nandā, and Pañcālacandī, on the pretext that they had been sent for by Brahmadatta to take part in the festivities as Videha and Mahosadha had both been killed, according to plan.  Meanwhile Brahmadatta had given orders that the whole city should be surrounded.  Videha was overcome with fright on discovering what was happening, but he put himself into Mahosadha's hands.  The latter led him into the large tunnel, and there he was brought face to face with the members of Brahmadatta's family, who had already been conducted thither.  Pañcālacandī was placed upon a heap of treasure and married to Videha.  On emerging from the tunnel, they were placed on board a waiting ship, with Tālatā and Nandā, and sent away into safety, escorted by the other ships, Mahosadha himself remaining behind in Uttarapañcāla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Brahmadatta came with his army to Upakāri, hoping to capture Videha.  There Mahosadha revealed to him what had happened, and, in due course, persuaded him to forget his wrath and inspect the tunnel.  While in the tunnel Brahmadatta expressed his remorse for having listened to the evil advice of Brahmadatta, and he and Mahosadha swore eternal friendship.  Mahosadha returned to Mithilā, taking with him Brahmadatta's dowry for his daughter; the members of Brahmadatta's family returned to Uttarapañcāla, and the two kings lived in great amity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videha died ten years later, and in fulfilment of a promise made to Brahmadatta, Mahosadha went to Uttarapañcāla.  There Nandā, who had never forgiven him, tried to poison the king's mind against him; but this plot was frustrated by a religious woman, Bherī (q.v.), and Brahmadatta remained his firm friend, loving him, as he confessed to Bheri, more than any of his own family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka was related to illustrate the Buddha's great wisdom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uppalavannā is identified with Bherī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suddhodana with Sirivaddhaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mahamāyā with Sumanādevī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bimbādevī with Amarā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ananda with Matthara, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sāriputta with Cūlani Brahmadatta, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devadatta with Kevatta, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culla Nandikā with Talatā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sundarī with Pañcālacandī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yasassikā with Nandī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ambattha with Kāvinda, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potthapātda with Pukkusa, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pilotika with Devinda, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saccaka with Senaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ditthamangalikā with Udumbarā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kundalī with the maynah bird, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lālūdāyī with King Videha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story occupies J.iv., pp.  329 478, in Fausböll's edition; what is given here is merely an extremely short summary; cp.  Mtu.ii.83 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Mahāpāli.  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāpāli.&lt;/b&gt; A refectory built by Devānampiyatissa Anurādhapura, for the use of the monks (Mhv.xx.23).  Various kings provided special food to be distributed there - e.g., Upatissa II., who sent food prepared for him in the palace (Cv.xxxvii.181; so did King Silākāla, Cv.xli.28), and himself ate of the food left over after the distribution (Cv.xxxvii.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahānāma enlarged the building (Cv.xxxvii.211), as did Silāmeghavana (Cv.xliv.65) and Udaya II (Cv.li.132).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhātusena instituted distribution of rice (Cv.xxxviii.41), while Aggabodhi II.  added to the hall and set up a stone canoe (bhattanāvam) for the distribution of rice (Cv.xlii.67; Aggabodhi I.  had already given a canoe of bronze, Cv.xlii.33).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his victory, Kassapa II., by way of celebration, held a special almsgiving at the Mahāpāli (Cv.xlv.1).  Dāthopatissa II.  distributed there clothing, rice, sour milk, milk and milk rice on uposatha days (Cv.xlv.25).  Mahinda I.  gave ten cartloads of food (Cv.xlviii.34), and Aggabodhi IX.  distributed daily an amount of rice equal in weight to his own body (Cv.lxix.78).  The Coliyans burnt down the building, and the last we hear of it is its restoration by Mahinda IV.  (Cv.liv.45).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāpāli.&lt;/b&gt; A monastic building, probably a refectory, built by Aggabodhi, son of Mahātissa, at Mahāgāma.  Cv.xlv.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Māyā, Mahāmāyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.52; see Thomas: op.  cit., 25).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father was the Sākiyan &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana,Añjana')"&gt;Añjana&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadaha,Devadaha')"&gt;Devadaha&lt;/a&gt;, son of Devadahasakka, and her mother &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasodharaa,Yasodharā')"&gt;Yasodharā&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayasena,Jayasena')"&gt;Jayasena&lt;/a&gt;.  (Mhv.ii.17ff.; elsewhere her father is called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Mahā Suppabuddha ')"&gt;Mahā Suppabuddha &lt;/a&gt; (ThigA.141), while the Apadāna (ii.538) gives the name of her mother as Sulakkhanā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii,Dandapāni')"&gt;Dandapāni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; were her brothers, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Mahā Pajāpatī')"&gt;Mahā Pajāpatī&lt;/a&gt; her sister.  Both the sisters were married to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; in their youth, but it was not till Māyā was between forty and fifty that the Buddha was born (Vibhā.278).  She had all the qualities necessary for one who was to bear the exalted rank of being the mother of the Buddha: she was not too passionate, she did not take intoxicants, she had practiced the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paramii,pāramī')"&gt;pāramī&lt;/a&gt; for one hundred thousand kappas, and had not, since her birth, violated the five &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/siila,sīlā')"&gt;sīlā&lt;/a&gt;.  On the day of her conception she kept her fast, and in her sleep that night she had the following dream: the four Mahārāja gods took her in her bed to Himavā and placed her under a sāla tree on Manosilātala.  Then their wives came and bathed her in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta,Anotatta Lake')"&gt;Anotatta Lake&lt;/a&gt; and clad her in divine robes.  They then led her into a golden palace and laid her on a divine couch; there the Bodhisatta, in the form of a white elephant, holding a white lotus in his gleaming trunk, entered into her right side.  This was on the day of the Uttarāsālhanakkhatta, after a festival lasting seven days, in which she had already taken part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the day of her conception she was guarded by the Four Regent Gods; she felt no desire for men, and the child in her womb could be seen from outside.  At the end of the tenth month she wished to return to her people in Devadaha, but, on her way thither, she stopped at the sāla grove in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lumbini,Lumbinī')"&gt;Lumbinī&lt;/a&gt; and there her child was born as she stood holding on to the branch of a sāla tree (J.i.49ff).  Seven days later Māyā died and was reborn as a male in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita,Tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt; world, under the name of Māyādevaputta (Thag.vss.533f.; ThagA.i.502).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt; immediately after the performance of the Twin Miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree, on the full moon day of Āsālha, and there, during the three months of the rainy season, the Buddha stayed, preaching the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother (who came there to listen to him), seated on Sakka's Pandukambalasilāsana, at the foot of the Pāricchattaka tree.  (It is said that, during this time, at certain intervals, the Buddha would return to earth, leaving a seated image of himself in Tāvatimsa to continue the preaching while he attended to his bodily needs, begging alms in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru,Uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt; and eating his food on the banks of Anotatta, where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; waited on him and learnt of what he had been preaching to the devas.) (DhSA.i.15; DhA.iii.216f)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (UdA.276f ) state the view, held by some, that had Māyā been alive the Buddha would not have shown such reluctance to bestow ordination on women.  This view, says &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala,Dhammapāla')"&gt;Dhammapāla&lt;/a&gt; is erroneous.  It would have made no difference, for it is the dhammatā of all Buddhas that women shall be ordained, but subject to certain important restrictions.  The mothers of all Buddhas die very soon after the birth of their son, because no other child is fit to be conceived in the same womb as a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māyā is mentioned in several Jātakas as the mother of the Bodhisatta - e.g., in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aliinacitta_jat_156,Alīnacitta')"&gt;the Alīnacitta, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthahaari_jak_7,Katthahāri')"&gt;the Katthahāri, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276,Kurudhamma')"&gt;the Kurudhamma, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii_jat_428,Kosambī')"&gt;the Kosambī, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542,Khandahāla')"&gt;the Khandahāla, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasaratha_jat_461,Dasaratha')"&gt;the Dasaratha, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bandhanagara_jat_201,Bandhanāgāra')"&gt;the Bandhanāgāra, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546,Mahāummagga')"&gt;the Mahāummagga, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatuposaka_jat_455,Mātuposaka')"&gt;the Mātuposaka, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547,Vessantara')"&gt;the Vessantara, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima_jat163_411,Susīma')"&gt;the Susīma, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somanassa_jat_505,Somanassa')"&gt;the Somanassa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509,Hatthipāla')"&gt;the Hatthipāla.  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to some contexts, after her birth as Phusatī in the Vessantara Jātaka, Māyā became one of the daughters of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii,King Kikī')"&gt;King Kikī&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Māyā's resolve to be the mother of a Buddha was formed ninety one kappas ago in the time of Vipassī Buddha (J.vi.480f).  She was then the elder daughter of King Bandhumā.  One of the king's vassals sent him a piece of priceless sandalwood and a golden wreath, worth one hundred thousand.  The sandalwood the king gave to his elder daughter and the wreath to the younger.  The elder powdered the sandalwood and took it in a golden casket to the Buddha.  Some of the powder she offered to the Buddha to be rubbed on his body, and the rest she scattered in his cell.  It was the sight of the Buddha's golden body that inspired her with the desire to be the mother of such a being.  Her sister later became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uracchadaa,Uracchadā')"&gt;Uracchadā&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsatthivassa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resident of Katthakasālā parivena.  King Vasabha went to the monastery, as the monk lay dying, intending to worship him, but at the door he heard the groans of the ill man, and disgusted that, after sixty years of monastic life, he should not be able to conquer his pain, he did not enter.  This was reported to the Elder, and putting forth great effort, he subdued his pain and sent word to the king to come to him.  Vasabha entered, and prostrating himself before the Elder, said, "I worship you, not for your arahantship, but for the exertion you put forth while yet a puthujjana." DA.i.291.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsakuludāyī Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visits the hermitage of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakuladaayii,Sakuludāyī')"&gt;Sakuludāyī&lt;/a&gt; near Rājagaha.  Sakuludāyi tells him that the Buddha, unlike other religious teachers, is honoured by his disciples, and gives it as his opinion that this is because the Buddha eats sparingly, is content with any raiment, accepts any alms, is satisfied with any lodging, lives in seclusion, and counsels others to do likewise.  The Buddha answers that if the esteem shown him depends on these qualities, he has numerous disciples more austere than himself with regard to these practices, and gives five other qualities which have won for him esteem: he has the higher virtues, outstandingly keen vision, super eminent intellect, he teaches his disciples the Noble Truths, and shows them the way in which to develop the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthāna')"&gt;satipatthāna&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has taught them, besides, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/dic3_s,sammā-ppadhāna')"&gt;sammā-ppadhāna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/iddhi_paada,iddhi-pāda')"&gt;iddhi-pāda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the five &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/indriya,indriyas')"&gt;indriyas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the five &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bala,bala')"&gt;bala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the seven &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga,bojjhangas')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Noble Eightfold Path, (&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/magga,magga')"&gt;magga&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the eight Deliverances (&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/vimokkha,vimokkha')"&gt;vimokkha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the eight spheres of mastery (&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/abhibhayatana,abhibhāyatamas')"&gt;abhibhāyatamas&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ten &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kasina,kasināyatanas')"&gt;kasināyatanas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhānas')"&gt;jhānas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the sixfold &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/abhinna,abhiññā')"&gt;abhiññā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that his disciples esteem him.

He went with his grandfather to hear the Buddha preach, won faith, and entered the Order.  He became skilled in the Doctrine, and, in due course, received higher ordination and became an arahant, with special proficiency in the four arūpajhānas.  Later, he was declared pre eminent among those skilled in the evolution of consciousness (saññāvivattakusalānam) (A.i.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His resolve to win such eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha when he heard a monk similarly honoured by the Buddha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahācūla (Cūlika ) Mahātissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Khallātanāga and Anulādevi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vattagāmani adopted him (thereby earning the title of Pitirājā) and took him with him when forced to flee from the Damilas (Mhv.xxxiii.35, 45; Dpv.xx.22f, 31).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahācūla succeeded Vattagāmani as king of Ceylon and ruled for fourteen years (17-3 B.C.).  He worked in a rice field, disguised as a labourer, and with the wages so earned gave alms to Mahāsumma.  For three years he laboured in a sugar mill near Sonnagiri and built the vihāras known as Mandavāpi, Abhayagallaka, Vankāvattakagalla, Dīghabāhugallaka, and Jālagāma.  He was succeeded by Coranāga (Mhv.xxxiv.1ff).  Mahācūla had two sons, Tissa (poisoned by the notorious Anulā) and Kutakannatissa.  Mhv.xxxiv.15, 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahākanha Jātaka (No.  469)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, when the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were already forgotten, there ruled a king named Usīnara.  Monks and nuns lived in wickedness, and men followed evil paths, being born, after death, in the Niraya.  Sakka, finding no one entering the deva worlds from among men, decided to scare the men into virtue.  Assuming the guise of a forester and leading Mātali disguised as a black fierce looking dog called Mahākanha, Sakka came to the city gates and cried aloud that the world was doomed to destruction.  The people fled in terror into the city and the gates were shut.  But the forester leapt over the city wall with his dog, the latter scaring everyone he saw.  The king shut himself up in his palace, but the dog put his forefeet on the palace window and set up a roar, which was heard from the hells to the highest heavens.  The forester said the dog was hungry, and the king ordered food to be given him.  But he ate it all in one mouthful and roared for more.  Usīnara then asked the forester what kind of dog it was, and was told that the animal ate up all those who walked in unrighteousness, and described who the unrighteous were.  Then having terrified everyone, Sakka revealed himself and returned to his heaven.  The king and his people became virtuous, and Kassapa's religion lasted for one thousand years more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a conversation among the monks to the effect that the Buddha was always working for the good of others, never resting, never tiring, his compassion extended towards all beings.  Mātali is identified with Ananda (J.iv.180 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The barking of Mahākanha was among the four sounds heard throughout Jambudīpa.  SNA.i.223; see J.iv.182, where only three are mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahārohanagutta Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of Therambatthala.  When he was ill, thirty thousand monks of great power came to minister to him.  The king of the Nāgas was also present, and as he offered rice gruel to the Elder, the king of the Supannas dashed across the sky to seize him.  But Buddharakkhita created a mountain, into which he made the Elder and the Nāga enter.  Vsm.155, 375; DhSA.187.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvācakāla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man who lived on the banks of the Mahāvālukagangā.  For thirty years he meditated on the thirty two impurities of the body in the hope of becoming a sotāpanna.  But at the end of that period he gave up his meditations, renouncing the Buddha's Doctrine as futile.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death he was born as a crocodile in the river, and one day sixty carts laden with stone pillars started crossing the river at Kacchakatittha.  The crocodile ate bulls, carts, and pillars.  AA.i.367.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta addresses the monks at Jetavana and tells them that, just as the foot of every creature will fit in the elephant's footprint, even so are all right states of mind comprised within the Four Noble Truths.  He then goes on to explain that dukkha consists of the five upādānakkhandhas visible shapes, feelings, perception, sankhāras and consciousness.  The constituents of these attachments are the four principle elements: earth, water, fire, and air.  Each element is of two kinds personal (ajjhatta) and external (bahiddhā) - and each is transient and subject to decay.  The chain of causation entails all that makes up the five attachments.  Where there is eye intact, on which external shapes come to focus, and where there is developed pertinent material to sustain it, there is developed a manifestation of the pertinent section of consciousness.  Thus arises the upādānakkhandha of form; similarly with the others.  M.i.184 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāmeghavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāmeghavana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park to the south of Anurādhapura.  Between the park and the city lay Nandana or Jotivana.  The park was laid out by Mutasīva, and was so called because at the time the spot was chosen for a garden, a great cloud, gathering at an unusual time, poured forth rain (Mhv.xi.2f).  Devānampiyatissa gave the park to Mahinda for the use of the Order (Mhv.xv.8, 24; Dpv.xviii.18; Sp.i.81) and within its boundaries there came into being later the Mahā-Vihāra and its surrounding buildings.  The fifteenth chapter of the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xv.27ff) gives a list of the chief spots associated with the religion, which came into existence there.  Chief among these are the sites of the Bodhi tree, the thirty two mālakas, the Catussālā, the Mahā Thūpa, the Thūpārāma, the Lohapāsāda, and various parivenas connected with Mahinda: Sunhāta, Dīghacankamana, Phalagga, Therāpassaya, Marugana and Dīghasandasenāpati.  Later, the Abhayagīri vihāra and the Jetavanārāma were also erected there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāmeghavana was visited by Gotama Buddha (Mhv.i.80; Dpv.ii.61, 64), and also by the three Buddhas previous to him.  In the time of Kakusandha it was known as Mahātittha, in that of Konagamana as Mahānoma, and in that of Kassapa as Mahāsāgara (Mhv.xv.58, 92, 126).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāmeghavana was also called the Tissārāma, and on the day it was gifted to the Sangha, Mahinda scattered flowers on eight spots contained in it, destined for future buildings, and the earth quaked eight times (Mhv.xv.174).  This was on the day of Mahinda's arrival in Anurādhapura.  The first building to be erected in the Mahāmeghavana was the Kālapāsāda parivena (q.v.) for the use of Mahinda.  In order to hurry on the work, bricks used in the building were dried with torches (Mhv.xv.203).  The boundary of the Mahāmeghavana probably coincided with the sīmā of the Mahāvihāra, but it was later altered by Kanitthatissa, when he built the Dakkhina vihāra.  Mhv.xxxvi.12. &lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;For a deposition of the various spots of the Mahāmeghavana see Mbv.137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Mahānāgavana.&lt;/b&gt; An open space in Ceylon, on the banks of the Mahāvālukagangā.  It was three yojanas long and one wide and was the meeting place of the Yakkhas.  The Buddha went there on his first visit to Ceylon, and in it was later built the Mahiyangana Thūpa.  Mhv.i.22f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahānāgavana.&lt;/b&gt; A park near Anurādhapura.  It was there that the relics brought by Sumana for the Thūpārama were first received by Devānampiyatissa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahābyūha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philosophers praise only themselves and their views, and disparage others.  Their disputations cannot lead to purity.  The true brahmin is he who has overcome all disputes and is confident in his knowledge.  He is indifferent to learning, for he is calm and peaceful (SN.vss.895 914).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was one of those preached on the occasion of the Mahāsamaya (SNA.ii.557), and is specially recommended for those inclined to confusion of mind (mohacaritānam).

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsāra Jātaka (No.  92)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  One day the king went with his queens to the park and the latter took off their ornaments for bathing.  A female monkey, watching her opportunity, stole a pearl necklace.  On the loss being discovered, the king had every person and every place searched.  A rustic, seeing the commotion, took to his heels and was chased and captured by the guards.  When questioned, he confessed to having stolen the necklace, thinking that the best way of saving his life, and said he had given it to the Treasurer.  The Treasurer said he had given it to the chaplain, the chaplain to the chief musician, the musician to the courtesan.  As it was by this time late, the matter was put off till the next day, the alleged accomplices being imprisoned.  The Bodhisatta, doubting their words, obtained the king's leave to investigate the matter.  He had the prisoners watched, and knew, from their reported conversations, that they were innocent.  He then decided that it had been stolen by a monkey, and gave orders that a number of monkeys should be captured and turned loose again with strings of beads round their necks, wrists, and ankles.  The monkey, who had stolen the necklace, on seeing the others with their beads, was filled with jealousy and produced the necklace.  The guard frightened her, and so she dropped it, and the Bodhisatta was greatly praised for his wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Ananda.  Pasenadi's wives wished for someone to preach to them in the palace.  Pasenadi went to the Buddha and from him heard the praises of Chattapānī.  Later, he met him and asked him to preach in his harem.  But Chattapānī was unwilling, saying that it was the prerogative of the monks.  Thereupon the king asked the Buddha to appoint someone, and the Buddha appointed Ananda.  One day Ananda found all the women of the palace very dejected, and learnt that the jewel of the king's turban had been lost and everyone was most distracted.  Ananda, therefore, went to the king and asked that each suspect should be given a wisp of straw on a lump of clay and asked to place it somewhere, the idea being that the thief would leave the jewel in one of these lumps.  The ruse, however, did not succeed, and orders were then given that a water pot be set in a retired corner of the courtyard behind a screen and that everyone should be asked to wash his hands.  When all had washed, the pot was emptied and the jewel found inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king of the Jātaka.  J.i.381 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahālabujagaccha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forest cleared by Devappatirāja.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He built a village there, and planted a large grove of jack trees near by (Cv.lxxxvi.49).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This village was among those given to Devappatirāja by Parakkamabāhu II., to be held in perpetuity.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāmālunkyā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the five bonds that chain uninstructed men to the lower life: delusion as to personality, doubt, attachment to rites, lusts of the flesh, and malevolence.  The path to the destruction of these bonds is the cultivation of the jhānas (M.i.432&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta is so called because it was preached in contradiction of a wrong answer given by Mālunkyāputta to a question of the Buddha.  The Buddha pointed out his error, and Ananda requested the Buddha to give the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the suttas which teach samatha-vipassanā.  MA.ii.572.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsīva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsīva.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon; he was the son of Mutasīva and the younger brother of Uttiya, whom he succeeded.  He reigned for ten years (197 87 B.C.) and built the Nagarangana vihāra for Bhaddasāla Thera.  He was succeeded by Sūratissa.  Mhv.xxi.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsīva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Resident of Vāmantapabbhāra.  He was among the last of the arahants, and had taken part in various assemblies led by the Bodhisatta (J.iv.490; vi.  30).  It is probably this Thera who is referred to as &lt;b&gt;Gāmantapabbhāravāsī&lt;/b&gt; Mahāsīva in the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.24, 29).  He lived in Tissamahārāma at Mahāgāma, and was the teacher of eighteen groups of monks.  One of his pupils became an arahant, and, being aware that his teacher was yet a puthujjana, went to him and asked his leave to be taught a stanza.  But Mahāsīva said his pupils were so numerous that he had no time to give him a stanza.  The pupil waited for a whole day and night, and then getting no chance of learning, said, "If you are so busy now how will you find time to die?" Mahāsīva heard and understood, and exerted himself strenuously for thirty long years, at the end of which time he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāsīva.&lt;/b&gt; A famous Commentator, sometimes called Dīghabhānaka Mahāsīva.  His interpretations are quoted, with respect, in the Commentaries.  E.g., DA.ii.430, 511, 543, 554, 805, 881, 883; SA.iii.171, 198; Sp.iii.711; DhSA.  405; PSA.  80; AA.ii.490.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahāsīva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of Bhātivanka, during the reign of Dutthagāmanī.  One day he went to worship at the Mahā Thūpa, and there he saw two devatās offering flowers.  In their previous lives they were two women who had worked for hire on the Mahā Thūpa.  Mhv.xxx.46ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahāsīva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Nigrodhapitthi and expert in the Tipitaka.  Once, while preaching the Sīhanāda Sutta in King Vasabha's palace, he described the splendours of the Relic Chamber in the Mahā Thūpa and the king expressed some difficulty in believing the report, but the Elder was able to convince the king that nothing was impossible where there was a combination of rājiddhi, deviddhi and ariyiddhi.  The king was pleased, conveyed the Elder under the white umbrella to the Mahā Vihāra and made great offerings, lasting for seven days, to the Mahā Thūpa.  MT.  555.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahāsīva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Mentioned as an eminent teacher of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3; Sp.i.63).  He is probably identical with one of the foregoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahāsīva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; It was for him that Aggabodhi I.  built a parivena and also the Kurunda vihāra with a tank and a grove of coco palms.  Cv.xlii.11, 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahāsīva&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Piyangudīpa.  See Mahāsena (5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Kammavibhanga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potaliputta comes to Samiddhi in his forest hut, near Veluvana in Rājagaha, and tells him that the Buddha has declared that all one says or does is vain; the only thing of importance is that which passes in one's mind.  Samiddhi protests against this, and when Potaliputta says, "Tell me, what does a man experience who acts of set purpose?" gives his own explanation.  Potaliputta then goes away without further talk and seeks Ananda, to whom he reports the incident.  Ananda takes him to the Buddha, remarking that Samiddhi should not have given a single direct reply to a question, which required careful qualifications in the answer.  Lāludāyi interrupts and is rebuked by the Buddha, who explains that the question was essentially a triple one and should have been so answered.  If a man's purposeful act is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling, his experience is pleasant; if an unpleasant feeling, unpleasant; if neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it is neither.  Ananda asks him to explain further, and this he does.  A man may be wicked in this world and yet, at death, pass either into heaven or into hell, he may be good yet go into hell or into heaven.  But one should not rush to conclusions from this truth, because the consequence of man's action, good or bad, may be felt either here and now, in the next birth, or at some other time.  Kamma can be divided into four classes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) not only in operation, but also having the appearance of being so; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) in operation, though not appearing so; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) in operation, and appearing so; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) not in operation, and not appearing so.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsaccaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccaka visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and questions him on the disciplining of the body and the mind.  The Buddha describes to him the training he underwent from the time of leaving the world to that of his Enlightenment, stopping at no exertion, avoiding no austerities till, in the end, wisdom came to him, and he realized that bliss could not be experienced with an emaciated body.  The Pañcavaggiyas, who had been with him till then, left him in disgust.  But he persevered, and, in the end, destroyed the āsavas.  Saccaka, addressed in the sutta as Aggivessana, expresses great admiration for the Buddha and acknowledges his superiority over other teachers.  M.i.237 51; see Thomas: op.  cit., 58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpitaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of Ceylon.  He was an eminent Thera and was teacher of Catunikāyika Tissa Thera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the great disturbance in the country (mahābhaya, probably the Brāhmanatissamahābhaya) there was only one monk who knew the Mahāniddesa, and Mahāpitaka asked his colleague, Mahārakkhita, to learn it from him.  But the latter refused on the plea of the wickedness of the monk possessing this knowledge; but in the end he acquiesced, on condition that Mahāpitaka himself would be present at the lessons.  On the day of the last lesson he discovered a woman hidden under the teacher's bed.  Sp.iii.695.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahātissa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahātissa.&lt;/b&gt; A thera who lived in Bhaggari in Ceylon.  He was an arahant, and is mentioned as being among the last of those who took part in various assemblies that followed the departure of the Bodhisatta during different births, such as the Kuddālaka Samāgama, Mūgapakkha, etc.  J.vi.30.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahātissa.&lt;/b&gt; Called Vanavāsī Mahātissa.  He was a colleague of Alindakavāsī Mahāphussadeva of Ceylon, and witnessed Sakka and other deities waiting on the latter in recognition of his holiness.  Mahātissa perceived only the radiance of the devas and questioned Phussadeva, who did not, however, give a direct answer.  SNA.i.55f.; Vibhā.352.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Called Ambakhādaka-Mahātissa.  He lived at Ciragumba, and is mentioned as an example of a monk who refused to eat food which came to him as a result of signifying in words that he desired it.  Vsm.43.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahātissa Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He lived in Cetiyagiri, and one day, while on his way to Anurādhapura, saw a woman who was leaving her husband, having quarrelled with him.  She was beautifully dressed, and seeing the Elder, smiled at him, in order to show her perfect teeth.  The Elder looked at her, and acquiring the perception of "the foul" through thinking of the bones of her teeth, became an arahant.  The husband followed his wife and asked the Elder if he had seen her.  The Elder replied, "I know not if it was man or woman, but I saw a lump of bones." Vsm.20f., 194.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Of Punnavallika.  One full moon day, at evening, he went to the courtyard of the Mahā Thūpa, saw the moonlight, and turning towards the shrine, entered into rapture, the Buddha being his object of thought.  He habitually recalled this experience thenceforth until, one day, he was able to travel through the air to the Mahā Thūpa.  Vsm.143; DhSA.116.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahātissa.&lt;/b&gt; An Elder of the Mahākarañjiya Vihāra.  He became an arahant by developing ānāpānasati, and was thus able to limit his life term.  Vsm.292.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahātissa Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; While begging for alms in Kalyānigāma his mind was defiled by the sight of an "uncommon" form (visabhāgarūpa, naked woman?).  SNA.i.6f.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of the Mandalārāma near Bhokkantagāma.  He was a reciter of the Dhammapada.  Sumanā, wife of Lakuntaka Atimbara, related the story of her past in the assembly of monks in association with this Thera.  DhA.iv.51.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Mahātissa.&lt;/b&gt; A man of the Okkāka race, father of Dappula I.  His wife was Sanghasivā, and they had two other sons, Aggabodhi and Maniakkhika, and one daughter.  Cv.xlv.38.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kotapabbata Viharā and teacher of Asubhakammika Tissa.  He was an arahant, and heard, with his divine ear, the description given in the Lohapāsāda by Cittagutta Thera of the marvels of the Mahā Thūpa.  Mahātissa told Cittagutta that the description was not full enough.  MT.  552f.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kambugallaka Vihāra.  He was a colleague of Kupikkala Mahātissa, and interceded on behalf of Vattagāmanī when that king's ministers wished to leave him.  Later, the ministers appointed him to look after all the monasteries built by them.  Mhv.xxxiii.76, 89ff.; MT.  619, 622.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Kupikkala Vihāra.  When Vattagāmanī was in hiding in the forest of Vessagiri, the Elder once provided him with a meal, and the king, out of gratitude, made him a grant of land (Mhv.xxxiii.49).  Later, the ministers wanted to revolt against the king on account of his cruelty to Tanasīva, but the Elder and his colleague Mahātissa from Kambugallaka, prevented them from doing so (Mhv.xxxiii.76).  When Vattagāmanī built the Abhayagiri Vihāra, he gave it into the charge of Mahātissa.  Mhv.xxxiii.83.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Mahātissa Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of the Mahāvihāra.  He was expelled by reason of his association with families.  His pupil Bahalamassutissa thereupon seceded from the Mahāvihāra and established a new sect in Abhayagiri.  Mhv.xxxiii.95ff.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Mahātissa Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Anurārāma.  Vohārīka Tissa was so pleased with him that he ordered alms to be regularly given to him in the Mucelapattana.  Mhv.xxxvi.30.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Mahātissa Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Even when sixty years old he did not realize that he was a puthujjana.  Then, one day, his pupil Dhammadinna of Talangara came to him, asking for his company in a journey to Tissamahā-vihāra, where he had been asked to preach.  Mahātissa greeted him, and in the course of conversation, Dhammadinna discovered that his teacher was under the false impression that he was an arahant.  Wishing to show him his error, he persuaded Mahātissa, by his iddhi power, to create a pond, and in the pond a lotus, which a young girl was picking.  At the sight of the girl, Mahātissa was possessed by lust, and realized that he was no arahant.  Dhammadinna withdrew, and that same day Mahātissa put forth effort and attained arahantship.  AA.i.25.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Mahātissa.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of Cittalapabbata.  He was troubled by lustful thoughts and consulted his teacher.  The Thera asked him to prepare a cell for him, which he did with great care.  The Thera then asked him to occupy it for one night, since he had taken so much trouble over it.  That night Mahātissa put forth effort and became an arahant.  AA.i.26.&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpunnama Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada,Migāramātupāsāda')"&gt;Migāramātupāsāda&lt;/a&gt; on a full moon night.  A monk asks the Buddha a series of questions regarding the five &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/upaadaana,upādānakkhandhā')"&gt;upādānakkhandhā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, their origin, their definition, and also as to how notions of self come about (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sakkaaya_ditthi,sakkāyaditthi')"&gt;sakkāyaditthi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;).  The Buddha answers him, and shows how deliverance can be attained by realization that there is no self in any &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/khandha,khandha')"&gt;khandha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that sixty monks, who heard the sutta, became arahants.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great monastery at Anurādhapura, for many centuries the chief seat of Buddhism in Ceylon.  It was founded by Devānampiyatissa, on the counsel of Mahinda, and included the Mahāmeghavana.  The Mahāmeghavanārāma henceforth came to be included in the Mahāvihāra.  The boundary of the vihāra was marked out by the king ploughing a circular furrow starting from near the Gangalatittha on the Kadambanadī and ending again at the river (Mhv.xv.188ff.; MT.361; Mbv.  135, 136 says that the ford on the Kadambanadī was Pāsānatittha).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list is given in the Mahābodhivamsa (pp.  135f) of the places through which the simā (boundary) of the Mahāvihāra passed - Pāsānatittha, Kuddavātakapāsāna, Kumbhakāraāvāta, the Mahānīpa tree, Kakudhapāli, Mahāangana tree, Khujjamātula tree, Marutta pokkharanī, the northern gate of the Vijayārāma park, Gajakumbhakapāsāna, then passing Avattimajjha, Bālakapāsāna on the Abhayavāpi, Mahāsusāna, Dīghapāsāna, the left side of Candalagāma, the Nīcasusāna to the left of Kammāradeva Sīmānigrodha, Veluvangana, round the hermitages of the Niganthas Jotiya Giri and Kumbhanda, to the right of the various hermitages of the Paribbājakas, by Hiyagalla, along the shrine of the brahmin Dīyavāsa, through Telumapāli, Tālacatukka, to the right of the stables (assamandala), on to Sasakapāsāna and Marumbatittha.  It then proceeded up the river to Sīhasinānatittha, on to Pāsānatittha, ending at Kuddavātakapāsāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvihāra contained thirty two Mālakas (Mhv.xv.214) and had numerous buildings attached to it, apart from sacred shrines, such as the Mahābodhi tree, Thūpārāma, Mahā Thūpa, etc.  In its early period, the precincts of the Mahāvihāra contained other buildings besides those dedicated to the service of Buddhism e.g., the hermitages of the Niganthas and the Paribbājakas (as mentioned above) and the shrine of the guardian deity of Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxv.87).  In the time of Vattagāmanī, the Mahāvihāra monks divided into two factions, and one party occupied Abhayagiri, built by the king (Mhv.xxxiii.97f).  At first the differences between these two factions were trivial, but, as time went on, Abhayagiri grew in power and riches and proved a formidable rival to the older monastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time various kings and nobles made additions and restorations to the Mahāvihāra.  Thus Vasabha (Mhv.xxxxv.88) built a row of cells, and Bhātikatissa erected a boundary wall (Mhv.xxxvi.2), while Kanitthatissa removed the boundary wall and constructed the Kukkutagiri parivena, twelve large pāsādas, a refectory, and a road leading from Mahāvihāra to Dakkhinavihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.10f).  Vohārikatissa appointed a monthly gift of a thousand to the monks of Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.32), while Sirisanghabodhi built a salāka house (Mhv.xxxvi.74).  Gothābhaya erected a stone pavilion and made a padhānabhūmi to the west of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxvi.102,106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the latter part of Gothābhaya's reign, a dispute arose between the Mahāvihāra and Abhayagiri on matters of doctrine, and sixty monks of Abhayagiri, who had adopted the Vetulyavāda, were banished.  They obtained the assistance of a Cola monk, named Sanghatissa, and at a solemn assembly of the monks concerned, at Thūpārāma, Sanghamitta expounded his heretical doctrine, refuting the opposition of the Mahāvihāra monks, and succeeded in winning over the king, who was present, in spite of the efforts of his uncle, Gothābhaya Thera, to bring him round to the orthodox party.  Sanghamitta became tutor to the king's sons, and when one of these, Mahāsena, became king, he prompted him to destroy the Mahāvihāra.  A royal decree was issued forbidding the giving of alms to the Mahāvihāra.  The monks thereupon left the monastery, and for nine years it remained deserted.  Many of the buildings were destroyed, and various possessions belonging to the Mahāvihāra were removed to Abhayagiri; but the people, led by the king's minister and friend, Meghavannābhaya, revolted against the impious deeds of Mahāsena and his admirers, Sanghamitta and Sona, and the king was forced to yield.  Sanghamitta and Sona were slain by one of the queens, and the king, with the help of Meghavannābhaya, rebuilt several parivenas and restored some of the possessions, which had been removed.  But Mahāsena's allegiance to the Mahāvihāra teaching was not lasting; acting on the advice of a monk named Tissa, he built the Jetavanavihāra in the grounds of the Mahāvihāra, against the wish of the monks there; the latter left again for nine months as a sign of protest against the king's attempts to remove the boundary of the vihāra.  This attempt, however, he was forced to abandon (Mhv.xxxvi.110f.; xxxvii.1 37).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāsena's son, Sirimeghavanna, on coming to the throne, exerted himself to undo the damage which had been wrought by his father.  He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda and restored all the demolished parivenas, together with their endowments (Cv.xxxvii.54ff).  Mahāvihāra had, by now, become famous as a seat of learning; it was the centre of Theravāda Buddhism, and was the repository of various Commentaries, of which the chief were the Sīhalatthakathā on the Pāli Canon.  Thither, therefore, came scholars from various countries, among them Buddhaghosa (q.,v.), who resided in the Ganthākara parivena and compiled his Pāli Commentaries (Cv.xxxvii.215ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dhātusena became king he had the walls of the Mahāvihāra painted with various ornamental designs (Cv.xxxviii.43).  The Dhammarucikas seem to have been favourites of this king and to have occupied the Mahāvihāra, later moving to Ambatthala vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.75).  Mahānāga instituted a permanent distribution of soup to the inhabitants of the Mahāvihāra (Cv.xli.99) and Jetthatissa III.  planted another Bodhi tree there, called the Mahāmetta (Cv.xliv.96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udaya I.  built a new salāka hall (Cv.xlix.14).  Aggabodhi IX.  discontinued the habit of the monks of the smaller vihāras surrounding Anurādhapura from coming to Mahāvihāra for their supply of medicines and made other arrangements for their distribution (Cv.xlix.88).  Sena I.  and his queen Sanghā erected and endowed the Sanghasena parivena (Cv.l.70), while Kassapa IV.  built the Samuddagiri parivena and gave it for the use of the Pamsukūlikas, while for the forest dwelling monks of Mahāvihāra he built forest dwellings (Cv.lii.21f.; Cv.  Trs.i.163, n.8).  Kassapa's kinsman, the general Rakkha, built a vihāra in the village of Savāraka and gave it to the incumbents of Mahāvihāra, to be used as a padhānaghara, while Mahālekhasena built, in Mahāvihāra itself, the Mahālekhapabbata (Cv.lii.31ff).  Udaya IV.  gave a diadem of jewels to the Buddha image in Mahāvihāra, while his wife Vidurā added to it a network of rays made of precious stones (Cv.liii.49ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the invasions of the Colas and the Pandus from South India, and owing to the consequent confusion prevailing in the country, the Mahāvihāra seems to have been neglected.  Many of the buildings were destroyed and their priceless possessions plundered.  Discipline among the monks became slack and there were many dissensions.  Later, when Parakkamabāhu I.  had restored peace, he wished to purify the religion, but met with great opposition, and it was only after strenuous efforts that he brought about a reconciliation between the different parties (Cv.lxxviii.11ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Cv.lxxviii.25) that the king could not find one single pure member of the Order.  He, therefore, held a special ordination ceremony, admitting many monks into the Order.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the removal of the capital from Anurādhapura to Pulatthipura, Mahāvihāra lost its importance; the centre of activity was now at Pulatthipura, and later, at other capitals, and the Mahāvihāra fell into neglect and decay, from which it has never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahādāthika Mahānāga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger brother of Bhātikābhaya and king of Ceylon for twelve years (67-79 A.C.).  He made a courtyard of kincikkha stones on plaster round the Mahā Thūpa, and built the Ambatthala thūpa, making it firm at the risk of his own life.  He placed chairs for the preachers in all the vihāras of Ceylon, and laid out the grounds round Cetiyagiri, holding a great celebration called the Giribhandapūjā (q.v.).  From the Kadambanadī to Cetiyagiri he laid carpets for the comfort of pilgrims.  He built the Manināgapabbata, the Kalanda, the Samudda, and the Cūlānāgapabbata Vihāras, and gave land for the use of monks in Pāsānadīpaka and Mandavāpi Vihāras in gratitude for favours shown him by novices of these monasteries.  He had two sons, Amandagāmani Abhaya and Kanirajānutissa, both of whom succeeded to the throne.  Mhv.xxxiv.  68ff.; xxxv.l.9; Dpv.xxi.34. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a queen called Damiladevī (apparently a Tamil lady) who died young.  AA.i.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahādhammarakkhita &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahādhammarakkhita Thera &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He lived at Asokārāma.  Once, Tissa, brother of Asoka, saw him seated at the foot of a tree meditating, fanned by a Nāga with a sāla branch.  Tissa was later ordained by him.  Mhv.v.161, 167; ThigA.i.505; but see Sp.i.561, according to which it was Yonaka Mahādhammarakhita who ordained Tissa; also SA.iii.125. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Third Council he was sent as messenger of Buddhism to Mahārattha.  There he preached the Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka, and eighty four thousand people were converted, thirteen thousand joining the Order.  Mhv.xii.5, 37; Dpv.viii.8; Sp.i.67.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahādhammarakkhita.  &lt;/b&gt; An ancient Commentator, generally called Tipitaka Mahādhammarakkhita, who is quoted several times in the Commentaries.  He was a contemporary of Dīghabhānaka Abhaya.  E.g., DhSA.267, 278, 286f.; Vibhā.81; PSA.405.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahādhammarakkhita.  &lt;/b&gt; An Elder of Tulādhāra vihāra in Rohana.  Tipitaka Cūlābhaya went to him from the Mahāvihāra in order to learn from him the Doctrine.  At the end of the teaching, Dhammarakkhita asked Abhaya to give him a subject for meditation, for, he said, Abhaya had a greater knowledge than he of that matter.  The subject was given, and soon after Dhammarakkhita attained Nibbāna, and died while preaching at the Lohapāsāda.  Vsm.96f.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

If he contemplates the misery of such things, craving ceases, like the growth of a tree which is cut in pieces and burnt to ashes.  S.ii.87f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Kassapa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Buddha's most eminent disciples, chief among those who upheld minute observances of form (dhutavādānam) (A.i.23).  He was born in the brahmin village of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahatittha,Mahātittha')"&gt;Mahātittha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, and was the son of the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila,Kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt;, his mother being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumanadevi,Sumanādevī')"&gt;Sumanādevī&lt;/a&gt;; he himself was called Pippali.  At Ap.ii.583, vs.  56; but there his father is called Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he grew up he refused to marry in spite of the wishes of his parents; but in the end, to escape from their importunities, he agreed to marry if a wife could be found resembling a statue, which he had made.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi,Bhaddā Kāpilānī')"&gt;Bhaddā Kāpilānī&lt;/a&gt; was found at Sāgala to fulfil these conditions, and though the young people wrote to each other suggesting that somebody else should be found as a match for each, their letters were intercepted and they were married.  By mutual consent, however, the marriage was not consummated, the two spending the night separated by a chain of flowers.  Pippali had immense wealth; he used twelve measures of perfumed powder daily, each measure a Magadhanāli, for his person alone.  He had sixty lakes with water works attached, and his workmen occupied fourteen villages, each as large as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"&gt;Anurādhapura&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day he went to a field, which was being ploughed and saw the birds eating the worms turned up by the plough.  On being told that the sin therein was his, he decided to renounce all his possessions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Bhaddā had been watching the crows eating the little insects, which ran about among the seamsum seeds that had been put out to dry, and when her attendant women told her that hers would be the sin for their loss of life, she also determined to renounce the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The husband and wife, finding that they were of one accord, took yellow raiments from their wardrobe, cut off each other's hair, took bowls in their hands, and passed out through their weeping servants, to all of whom they granted their freedom, and departed together, Pippali walking in front.  But soon they agreed that it was not seemly they should walk thus together, as each must prove a hindrance to the other.  And so, at the cross roads, he took the right and she the left and the earth trembled to see such virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, sitting in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, knew what the earthquake signified, and having walked three gāvutas (this journey of the Buddha is often referred to - e.g., MA.i.347, 357), sat down at the foot of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bahuputta,Bahuputtaka Nigrodha')"&gt;Bahuputtaka Nigrodha&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"&gt;Nālandā&lt;/a&gt;, resplendent in all the glory of a Buddha.  Pippali (henceforth called Mahā Kassapa, no explanation is to be found anywhere as to why he is called Kassapa; it was probably his gotta name, but see Ap.ii.583, vs.56) saw the Buddha, and recognising him at once as his teacher, prostrated himself before him.  The Buddha told him to be seated, and, in three homilies, gave him his ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three homilies are given at S.ii.220, "Thus Kassapa must thou train thyself: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) 'There shall be a lively sense of fear and regard (hirotappa) towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.' &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) 'Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.' &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) 'Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall not be neglected by me.'"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they returned to Rājagaha, Kassapa, who bore on his body seven of the thirty two marks of a Great Being, following the Buddha.  On the way, the Buddha desired to sit at the foot of a tree by the roadside, and Kassapa folded for him his outer robe (pilotikasanghāti) as a seat.  The Buddha sat on it and, feeling it with his hand, praised its softness.  Kassapa asked him to accept it.  "And what would you wear?" inquired the Buddha.  Kassapa then begged that he might be given the rag robe worn by the Buddha.  "It is faded with use," said the Buddha, but Kassapa said he would prize it above the whole world and the robes were exchanged.  (The robe which Kassapa exchanged with the Buddha was Punnā's cloak.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaa,Punnā 6')"&gt;Punnā 6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident Kassapa always recalled with pride, e.g.  S.ii.221. It is said that the Buddha paid him this great honour because he knew that Kassapa would hold a recital after his death, and thus help in the perpetuation of his religion, SA.ii.130. The earth quaked again in recognition of Kassapa's virtues, for no ordinary being would have been fit to wear the Buddha's cast off robe.  Kassapa, conscious of the great honour, took upon himself the thirteen austere vows (dhutagunā) and, after eight days, became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past Kassapa and Bhaddā had been husband and wife and companions in good works in many births.  In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha Kassapa was a very rich householder named Vedeha and married to Bhaddā, and very devoted to the Buddha.  One day he heard the Buddha's third disciple in rank (Nisabha) being awarded the place of pre eminence among those who observed austere practices, and registered a wish for a similar honour for himself in the future.  He learnt from the Buddha of the qualities in which Nisabha excelled the Buddha himself, and determined to obtain them.  With this end in view, during birth after birth, he expended all his energies in goods deeds.  Ninety one kappas ago; in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"&gt;Vipassī&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, he was the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekasaataka,Ekasātaka')"&gt;Ekasātaka&lt;/a&gt; and Bhaddā was his wife.  In the interval between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana,Konāgamana')"&gt;Konāgamana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddhas he was a setthiputta.  He married Bhaddā, but because of an evil deed she had done in the past (see Bhaddā Kāpilānī), she became unattractive to him and he left her, taking her as wife again when she became attractive.  Having seen from what had happened to his wife how great was the power of the Buddhas, the setthiputta wrapped Kassapa Buddha's golden cetiya with costly robes and decked it with golden lotuses, each the size of a cartwheel.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therī Apadāna (Ap.ii.582. vs.  47-51) gives an account of two more of his lives, one as Sumitta and the other as Koliyaputta, in both of which he and his wife ministered to Pacceka Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next birth he was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, and, because he had given robes in past lives, he had thirty two kapparukkhas, which provided him and all the people of his kingdom with garments.  At the suggestion of his queen, he made preparations to feed holy men, and five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumaa,Padumā')"&gt;Padumā&lt;/a&gt;, came to accept his gift.  In that life, too, Nanda and his queen renounced the world and became ascetics, and having developed the jhānas, were reborn in the Brahma world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This account of Kassapa's last life and his previous life is compiled from AA.i.92ff.; SA.ii.135ff.; ThagA.ii.134ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.  Ap.i.33ff.  gives other particulars - that he made offerings at Padumuttara's funeral pyre and that he was once a king named Ubbiddha in the city of Rammaka; see also ApA.i.209f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he was journeying from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusināra')"&gt;Kusināra&lt;/a&gt; he met an &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aajiivakaa,Ājīvaka')"&gt;Ājīvaka&lt;/a&gt; carrying in his hand a mandārava flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news.  It was then the seventh day after the Buddha's death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre.  The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha's feet.  Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha's feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them.  He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself (D.ii.163f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mhv.xxxi.20f.; see also Vsm.430) that the relics of the Buddha which fell to Ajātasattu's share were taken to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; by Kassapa, in view of that which would happen in the future.  At &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; (on the announcement of the Buddha's death), Kassapa had heard the words of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhadda,Subhadda')"&gt;Subhadda&lt;/a&gt;, who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were "well rid of the great samana and could now do as they liked." This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa's mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha's teachings.  He announced his intention to the assembled monks, and, as the senior among them and as having been considered by the Buddha himself to be fit for such a task, he was asked to make all necessary arrangements (e.g., DA.i.3).  In accordance with his wishes, all the monks, other than the arahants chosen for the Recital, left Rājagaha during the rainy season.  The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya (DA.i.3f.; 5ff.; Sp.i.4.ff.; Mhv.iii.3ff).  This recital is called the Therasangitī or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theravaada,Theravāda')"&gt;Theravāda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa - he is classed with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kappina_th,Kappina')"&gt;Kappina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; for his great iddhi-powers.  E.g., S.i.114; but his range of knowledge was limited; there were certain things which even Kassapa did not know (DhA.i.258).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives (S.ii.205), and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment (S.ii.194f) and his ability to win over families by his preaching.  The Buddha compares him to the moon (candopama), unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion.  S.ii.197ff.  Kassapa's freedom from any kind of attachment was, as the Buddha pointed out to the monks, due to the earnest wish he had made for that attainment in the past, "He has no attachment to requisites or households or monasteries or cells; but is like a royal swan which goes down into a lake and swims there, while the water does not adhere to his body" (DhA.ii.169f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhānas')"&gt;jhānas&lt;/a&gt; and abiding therein (S.ii.210ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them (E.g., Thag.vss.1051-57, 1072-81, and his long sermon at A.v.161ff ); but he was evidently sensitive to criticism, and would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction.  E.g., S.ii.203ff.; and at 219, when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa,Thullanandā')"&gt;Thullanandā&lt;/a&gt; finds fault with him for blaming &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;.  See below.  Kassapa had good reason for not wishing to address recalcitrant monks.  The&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kutiduusaka_jat_321,Kutidūsaka Jātaka')"&gt;Kutidūsaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; relates how one of his disciples,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ulunka_saddaka,Ulunka Saddaka')"&gt;Ulunka Saddaka&lt;/a&gt;, angered by some admonition from Kassapa, burnt the latter's grass hut while he was away on his alms round (J.iii.71f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ananda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns.  He was probably not popular among them, for, at the end of his discourse, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_tissaa,Thullatissā')"&gt;Thullatissā&lt;/a&gt; openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ananda, "as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker." (S.ii.215f) Kassapa loved Ananda dearly, and was delighted when Ananda attained arahantship in time to attend the First Recital, and when Ananda appeared before the arahants, it was Kassapa who led the applause (DA.i.10f).  But Kassapa was very jealous of the good name of the Order, and we find him (S.ii.218f) blaming Ananda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public.  "A corn trampler art thou, Ananda," he says, "a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away," and ends up with "The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure." Ananda, annoyed at being called "boy," protests "Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence." This incident, says the Commentary took place after the Buddha's death, when Ananda, as a new arahant and with all the honour of his intimacy with the Buddha, whose bowl and robe he now possessed, had become a notable personage.  SA.ii.133; Ananda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect (see Vin.i.92f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ananda and raised her voice in protest, "What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ananda?" Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ananda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done.  S.ii.224f.  At the First Council, when Ananda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity (Vin.ii.287f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic.  See also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagosinga_s,Mahāgosinga Sutta')"&gt;Mahāgosinga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.214), where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somamitta_thera,Somamitta')"&gt;Somamitta&lt;/a&gt; who, finding his own teacher&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimala,Vimala')"&gt;Vimala&lt;/a&gt; given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end.  Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused.  S.ii.202f; but See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotidaasa,Jotidāsa')"&gt;Jotidāsa&lt;/a&gt;, who is said to have built a vihāra for Kassapa, and entertained him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pipphaliguha,Pipphaliguhā')"&gt;Pipphaliguhā&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga,bojjhangas')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt; which he had practised (S.v.78).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that he had profited by the Master's teaching, we are told (SA.iii.128), calmed his blood and purified his system, and the sickness fell away from him "like a drop of water from a lotus leaf." He disdained being waited upon by anybody, even by a goddess such as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laja,Lājā')"&gt;Lājā&lt;/a&gt;, lest he should set a bad example (DhA.iii.6ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to his great saintliness, even the gods vied with each other to give alms to Kassapa.  Once when he had risen from a trance lasting seven days, five hundred nymphs, wives of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before him; but, snapping his fingers, he asked them to depart, saying that he bestowed his favours only on the poor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Kālavilangika is an example of Kassapa's compassion for the poor.  Once, after a seven days' trance, he went to the house of Kālavilanga and received alms from his wife, which he gave to the Buddha for their greater benefit.  The Buddha took a portion of this and gave the rest to five hundred monks.  Kālavilangika, received only a mouthful of the food left.  The Buddha said that as a result he would be a setthi within seven days.  Kālavilangika told this to his wife.  It happened that a few days later the king saw a man impaled alive in the place of execution; the man begged him for some food, which he agreed to send.  At night, when eating, the king remembered his promise, but could find no one bold enough to go to the cemetery.  On the offer of one thousand pieces, Kālavilangika's wife agreed to go in the guise of a man.  On the way she was stopped by the yakkha &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighataphala,Dīghataphala')"&gt;Dīghataphala&lt;/a&gt;, who, however, later released her and gave her treasure, as did also the yakkha's father in law, the deva &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt;.  The man ate the food and, when wiping his mouth, recognised her as a woman and caught hold of her hair.  But she cut off her hair, and proved to the satisfaction of the king that her mission had been accomplished.  She then recovered the treasure given her by the yakkha and Sumana; when the king discovered her wealth, she and her husband were raised to the rank of setthi (MA.ii.812ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sakka heard of this, he disguised himself as a weaver worn with age, and accompanied by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa,Sujātā')"&gt;Sujātā&lt;/a&gt;, transformed into an old woman, appeared in a weaver's hut along the lane where Kassapa was begging.  The ruse succeeded and Kassapa accepted their alms; but, later, be discovered the truth and chided Sakka.  Sakka begged forgiveness, and, on being assured that in spite of his deception the almsgiving would bring him merit, he flew into the air shouting, "Aho dānam, mahā danam, Kassapassa patitthitam." The Buddha heard this and sympathised with Sakka in his great joy (DhA.i.423ff.; cp.  Ud.iii.7).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on one occasion so great was the importunity with which the monks of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavii,Alavi')"&gt;Alavi&lt;/a&gt; had wearied the people, that even Mahā Kassapa failed to get alms from them (J.ii.282).  The Visuddhi Magga (403) relates a story of how once, when Kassapa was begging for alms in Rājagaha, in the company of the Buddha, on a festival day, five hundred maidens were going to the festival carrying cakes, "round like the moon." They saw the Buddha but passed him by, and gave their cakes to Kassapa.  The Elder made all the cakes fill just his single bowl and offered it to the Buddha (This is probably the incident referred to at Vsm.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa_sam,Kassapa Samyutta')"&gt;Kassapa Samyutta&lt;/a&gt; contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna (S.ii.195f), and the other on the existence of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tathaagata,Tathāgata')"&gt;Tathāgata&lt;/a&gt; after death (S.ii.222f).  This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song (Thag.vs.1082 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kassapa lived to be very old, and, when he died, had not lain on a bed for one hundred and twenty years.  DA.ii.413; AA.ii.596; he was one hundred and twenty at the time of the First Recital (SA.ii.130).  According, to northern sources, Kassapa did not die; he dwells in the Kukkutagiri Mountains, wrapt in samādhi, awaiting the arrival of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya,Metteyya')"&gt;Metteyya&lt;/a&gt; Buddha (Beal, op.  cit., ii.142f.).  A tooth of Mahā Kassapa was enshrined in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhimatittha_vih,Bhīmatittha vihāra')"&gt;Bhīmatittha vihāra&lt;/a&gt; in Ceylon (Cv.lxxxv.81).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is several times referred to in the Jātakas.  Thus, he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the father in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gagga_jat_155,Gagga Jātaka')"&gt;Gagga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (ii.17), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the brahmin in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276,Kurudhamma')"&gt;Kurudhamma&lt;/a&gt; (ii.381), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one of the devaputtas in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakkaaru_jat_326,Kakkāru')"&gt;Kakkāru&lt;/a&gt; (iii.90), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendissara,Mendissara')"&gt;Mendissara&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/indriya_jat_423,Indriya')"&gt;Indriya&lt;/a&gt; (iii.469), and in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sarabhanga_jat_522,Sarabhanga')"&gt;Sarabhanga&lt;/a&gt; (v.151), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the father in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padakusalamanava_jat_432,Padakusalamānava')"&gt;Padakusalamānava&lt;/a&gt; (iii.514), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the teacher in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438,Tittira')"&gt;Tittira&lt;/a&gt; (iii.545), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatali,Mātali')"&gt;Mātali&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bilarikosiya_jat_450,Bīlārakosiya')"&gt;Bīlārakosiya&lt;/a&gt; (iv.69), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one of the seven brothers in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488,Bhissa')"&gt;Bhissa&lt;/a&gt; (iv.314), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the bear in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancuposatha_jat_490,Pañcuposatha')"&gt;Pañcuposatha&lt;/a&gt; (iv.332), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the chaplain in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509,Hatthipāla')"&gt;Hatthipāla&lt;/a&gt; (iv.491), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhura,Vidhura')"&gt;Vidhura&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhava_jat_515,Sambhava')"&gt;Sambhava&lt;/a&gt; (v.67), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the senior ascetic in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankhapala_jat_521,Sankhapāla')"&gt;Sankhapāla&lt;/a&gt; (v.177), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kulavaddhana setthi in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_sutasoma_jat_525,Cullasutasoma')"&gt;Cullasutasoma&lt;/a&gt; (v.192), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suriya,Suriya')"&gt;Suriya&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sudhabhojana_jat_535,Sudhābhojana')"&gt;Sudhābhojana&lt;/a&gt; (v.412), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tree sprite in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasutasoma_jat_537,Mahāsutasoma')"&gt;Mahāsutasoma&lt;/a&gt; (v.511), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the father in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sama_jat_540,Sāma')"&gt;Sāma&lt;/a&gt; (vi.95), and Sūra Vāmagotta in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542,Khandahāla')"&gt;Khandahāla&lt;/a&gt; (vi.157).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahā Kassapa was so called to distinguish him from other Kassapas (BuA.42; chiefly Kumāra Kassapa, VibhA.60), and also because he was possessed of great virtues (mahanti hi sīlakkhanda hi Samannāgatattā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mahā Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt; An eminent thera of Ceylon, incumbent of Udumbaragirivihāra, who, as the most senior monk, was in charge of the reform of the Sangha carried out by Parakkamabāhu I.

Hearing this several monks protested, but failed to convince him of his error.  Sāti was therefore brought before the Buddha and acknowledged that he had spread such a view.  The Buddha explains that he had always taught that consciousness arises only by causation and that, without assignable condition, consciousness does not come about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four substances (āhārā), which either maintain existing organisms or help those yet to be: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;material substance, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;contact, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cogitation, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;perception.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The derivation and birth of all four substances is craving- craving arises from feeling and so on.  Three things must combine for a conception to take place: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the coitus of the parents, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the menstruation, at the time, of the mother, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and the presence of a being awaiting rebirth (gandhabba).

He courted a female hawk on the western shore, and, at her suggestion, made friends with an osprey on the west side, a lion on the north and a tortoise on an island in the lake.  Later, the hawks had two sons, who lived on the island.  One day, some men, wandering about in search of food, lay down under the tree where the hawks lived and kindled a fire to keep away the insects.  The smoke disturbed the young ones and they set up a cry.  The men, hearing this, wished to get the birds for their food.  But the she hawk, perceiving the danger, sent her husband to summon their friends.  First came the osprey who brought water in his wings and quenched the fire every time it was lighted; when he was tired, the tortoise sent his son with mud from the lake, which he put on the fire.  The men caught the tortoise and tied it with creepers, but he plunged into the water, dragging the men with him.  Then the lion appeared, and at his first roar the men fled, and the friends rejoiced over the firmness of their friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to Mittagandhaka (q.v.) and his wife.  They were the hawks of the story.  Rāhula was the young tortoise and Moggallāna the father tortoise.  Sāriputta was the osprey and the Bodhisatta the lion.  J.iv.288-97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The citizens of Benares once invited the Buddha and his monks and went about asking people to help in their entertainment.  In spite of their extreme poverty, Mahāduggata and his wife undertook to look after one monk; they both worked hard to earn the necessary money and then prepared a simple meal.  Sakka, knowing what was to come, came in the guise of a labourer to help them.  When the time came for the meal it was found that in allotting the monks to their several hosts, Mahāduggata's house had been overlooked.  Mahāduggata wrung his hands and burst into tears, but somebody pointed out to him that nobody was yet entertaining the Buddha.  He, therefore, went to the vihāra and invited the Buddha, who accepted the invitation, while princes and nobles waited outside wishing to conduct him to their own palaces.  The Buddha ate the food prepared by Mahāduggata and Sakka and returned thanks.  That same day, by the power of Sakka, the seven kinds of jewels fell from the sky and filled Mahāduggata's house, and when it was reported to the king that he was the wealthiest man in the city, he was appointed Treasurer.  Mahāduggata built a new house and discovered many hidden treasures while digging the foundations.  With the money from these he entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days, and, after death, was reborn in heaven.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pandita,Panditasāmanera')"&gt;Panditasāmanera&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Assāroha Jātaka (No.  302)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares, and having been defeated in some frontier disturbance, he fled on his horse till he reached a certain village.  At sight of him all the people disappeared except one man, who made enquiries, and, on finding that he was no rebel, took him home and entertained him with great honour, looking well after his horse.  When the king left, he told the man that his name was Mahā Assāroha, and asked him to visit his home if ever he should be in the city.  On reaching the city himself, he gave orders to the gate keepers that if anyone should come enquiring for Mahā Assāroha, he should be brought at once to the palace.  Time passed and the man failed to appear.  The king, therefore, constantly increased the taxes of the village, until the villagers asked their neighbour to visit his friend Mahā Assāroha and try to obtain some relief.  So he prepared presents for Mahā Assāroha and his wife, and taking a cake baked in his own house he set forth.  Arrived at the city gates, he was conducted by the gate keeper to the palace.  There the king accepted his presents, showed him all the honours due to a king, and, in the end, gave him half of his kingdom.  When the ministers complained, through the medium of the king's son, that a mere villager had been exalted to the rank of king, the Bodhisatta explained that real friends who help one in time of adversity should be paid every honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the good offices of Ananda, who is identified with the villager.  J.iii.8 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Mahākapi Jātaka (No.  407)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, leader of eighty thousand.  In the grove where they lived was a mango tree (some say a banyan) growing on a river bank bearing fruit of divine flavour, and the monkeys were always careful to let no fruit drop into the river.  But one day a fruit, which bad been hidden by an ants' nest, fell into the water, and was picked up at Benares, where the king was bathing.  The king tasted it, and being seized with a desire to eat more, had many rafts made, and ascended the river with a company of foresters.  They found the tree, and the king, having eaten his fill, lay down at the foot.  At midnight the Bodhisatta came with his retinue and started eating the mangoes.  The king was disturbed, and gave orders to his archers that the wood should be surrounded and all the monkeys shot at daybreak.  But the Bodhisatta was a real leader; he ascended a straight-growing branch and, with one leap, reached the river bank.  He then marked the distance, and having cut off a bamboo shoot of the required length, fastened one end to a tree on the bank and the other end round his waist.  On leaping back, he found he had not allowed for the length which went round his waist, but grasping a branch firmly with both hands, he signalled to his followers to cross the bridge so formed.  The eighty thousand monkeys thus escaped; but the monkey who was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt;, coming last, saw a chance of injuring the Bodhisatta, and taking a spring into the air, fell on the Bodhisatta's back, breaking it, There the Bodhisatta hung in agony, and the king who had seen all this caused him to be brought down and covered with a yellow robe and ministered to.  But nothing could be done, and the Bodhisatta died after having admonished the king.  A funeral pyre was made with one hundred wagon loads of timber, and the dead monkey was paid all the honours due to a king.  A shrine was built on the spot where the cremation took place, while the skull was inlaid with gold and taken to Benares, where a great feast was held in its honour for seven days.  Afterwards it was enshrined and offerings were made to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told concerning good works towards one's relations, as narrated in the introduction to the Bhaddasāla Jātaka.  Ananda is identified with the king.  J.iii.369-75; cf.  Jātakamālā, No.  27; the story is sculptured in the stūpa of Bharhut, Cunningham, pl.xxxiii.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka is also called the Rājovāda Jātaka.  It is probably this story which is said to have greatly impressed Ilanāga when he heard it from the Thera Mahāpaduma, who lived in Tulādhāra.  Mhv.xxxv.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Mahākapi Jātaka (No.  516)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a monkey, and one day, in the forest, he came across a man who had fallen into a pit while looking for his oxen and had lain there starving for ten days.  The Bodhisatta pulled him out and then lay down to sleep.  But the man, very hungry, and wishing to eat him, struck his head with a stone, grievously wounding him.  The monkey at once climbed a tree in order to escape, but realizing that the man would be unable to find his way out of the forest, he jumped from tree to tree (in spite of his intense pain) and showed him the way out.  The man became a leper, and wandered about for seven years till he came to the Migācira Park in Benares and told his story to the king.  At the end of his recital the earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta's&lt;/a&gt; attempt to kill the Buddha by hurling a stone upon him.  The leper was Devadatta.  J.v.67 74; cf.  Jātakamāla, No.  24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is also called the Vevatiyakapi Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsena.  &lt;/b&gt; A deva living in Ketumatī Palace to the east of Vejayanta.  At the request of Sakka and of members of the Order, led by Assagutta, he was born in the world of men as Nāgasena.  Mil.  6f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsena.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin, friend of Vanganta, father of Sāriputta.  He was poor, and, out of compassion for him, Sāriputta came to his house for alms.  Twice Mahāsena hid himself, having nothing to give, but, one day, receiving a bowl of rice porridge and a small piece of cloth, he thought of Sāriputta.  The Elder had just risen from a trance, and, becoming aware of Mahāsena's desire, he visited him, and was given the porridge and the piece of cloth with a prayer from Mahāsena, "May I realize the Truth you have seen." After death, Mahāsena was born as the novice and was called Vanavāsī Tissa.  DhA.ii.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāsena.&lt;/b&gt; Younger son of King Gothābhaya.  He became king of Ceylon (334&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-361 A.C.), and under the advice of his teacher Sanghamitta and his minister Sona, he despoiled Mahāvihāra and enriched Abhayagiri.  He issued a decree that no one should give alms to the monks of Mahāvihāra.  But, later, his friend and minister, Meghavannābhaya, convinced him of his error, and he became a supporter of Mahāvihāra.  Soon after, however, he fell under the influence of a monk, named Tissa, and built Jetavanaviharā in the precincts of Mahāvihāra, despite the protests of the monks.  Tissa was later expelled from the Order.  The king built the Manihīra, Gokanna, Erakāvilla, Kalandagāma, Migagāma, Gangāsenakapabbata, Dhātusenapabbata, Kokavāta, Rūpārāma, and Hulapitthi vihāras and two nunneries Uttara and Abhaya.  He also built sixteen tanks and a great canal called Pabbatanta.  (Dpv.xxii.66 76; Mhv.xxxvii.1ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirimeghavanna was the son of Mahāsena.  Cv.xxxvii.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahāsena.&lt;/b&gt; A king of India who ruled in Pātaliputta.  He fed one thousand monks daily; but, not satisfied with that, he went to Uttaramadhurā, where he labored in disguise, giving alms with the wages so earned.  Cv.xcii.23ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahāsena&lt;/b&gt;.A king of Pātaliputta.  He and his sister worked with their own hands and gave alms to 500 monks from Piyangudīpa, among whom was Mahāsīva (8).  The monk wished that they should see their alms being eaten by the monks in Piyangudīpa.  Ras.i.72f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā-Angana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in Anurādhapura through which the sīmā of the Mahā-vihāra passed; it was so called because of a large angana-tree which stood there.  Mbv.135,136.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāgopālaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached to the monks at Jetavana.  A herdsman who is ignorant of form, has no eye for marks, does not get out ticks, does not dress sores, does not smoke out lairs, knows nothing either of fords or watering places, roads or pastures, milks the cows dry, and fails to pay special attention to the leaders of the herd - such a herdsman cannot look after his herd nor promote its increase.  A monk who has the corresponding eleven bad qualities is not capable of showing growth and progress in the Dhamma and the Vinaya.  M.i.220ff.; A.v.347ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Assapura Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assapura,Assapura')"&gt;Assapura&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga,Anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since monks are called recluses (samanā) they must train themselves to be true samanas and brāhmanas; they should be &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;conscientious and scrupulous, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pure in deed, word and thought, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;guarding the portals of the senses, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;moderate in eating, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ever vigilant, mindful and self possessed, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;striving to put off the five nivaranā and cultivating the jhāna.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an almsman can truly be called a samana, a brahmin, a nahātaka, vedagū, sotthiya, ariya, and arahant.  He is an ideal recluse.  M.i.271-80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā-Anula Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He once saw a number of monks, who had obtained only dry food, eating it on the banks of a river.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anula resolved that the river water should turn into butter cream and made a sign to the novices, who then took the cream in cups and gave it to the monks.

He was once sitting at the foot of a tree to meditate, but because of the great power of his virtue, the children of the tree deity grew restless, and the deity tried to frighten him away but failed.  She then appeared before the Thera, in disguise and told him of her trouble.  He asked her to take her family somewhere else for that day only as he did not wish it to be thought that she had seared him away.  MA.i.131.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahādatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An incumbent of Hankanaka who wrongly believed that he was an arahant because of the in-operation of the corruptions.  Vsm.634; Vibhā.489.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahādatta.&lt;/b&gt; An Elder of Moravāpi, an eminent commentator whose opinions are quoted in the Commentaries.  E.g., DhSA.  230, 267, 284, 286; PSA.  405.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahādatta.&lt;/b&gt; A senāpati.  He was a follower of the brāhmanas, and at the moment of his death he saw before him a picture of hell.  The brahmins who were round him asked him what he saw, and he said that he saw a house blood red in colour.  They assured him that that was the Brahma world, but after death he was born in hell.  MA.ii.803.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsupina Jātaka (No.  77)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi, king of Kosala, had, one night, sixteen bad dreams, and his brahmins, on being consulted, said that they presaged harm either to his kingdom, his life, or his wealth, and prescribed all manner of sacrifices in order to avert the danger (It is perhaps this sacrifice which is referred to at S.i.75).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā, the king's wife, heard of this and suggested that the Buddha should be consulted.  The king followed her advice, and the Buddha explained the dreams.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first dream was of wild bulls entering the royal courtyard to fight but retiring after roaring and bellowing.  This, said the Buddha, meant that, in future, when wicked kings rule, rain clouds will gather, but there will be no rain.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second dream was of trees and shrubs sprouting from the earth which flowered and bore fruit when only about one span high.  This foretold a time when men would be short lived owing to their lusts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the third dream cows sucked calves which were hardly a day old.  This showed that, in the future, the young would refuse respect to the old.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fourth dream was of sturdy draught oxen standing by, while young steers tried to draw loads.  This signified a time when the administration of affairs will be entrusted to the young and inexperienced, while the wise and old stand by.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fifth dream was of a horse which ate from two mouths, one on either side of its body, which foretold a time when the king's justices will take bribes from contending parties and give themselves to corruption.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sixth dream was of people holding a very valuable golden bowl and asking a jackal to stale therein.  This shows that, in the future, kings will exalt the low born and noble maidens will be mated with upstarts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The seventh dream was of a man holding a rope which he trailed at his feet, while a she jackal kept on eating it.  This foretold a time when women will lose their sense of modesty and behave badly.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the eighth dream was a big pitcher at the palace gates filled with water and surrounded by empty ones.  This foretold a time when kings will be poor and set the whole country working for them, the people being left in extreme poverty.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ninth dream was of a deep pool with sloping banks overgrown with lotus.  Men and beasts entered the pond; the middle was muddy, but at the edges was crystal water.  This meant that in the future there would be unrighteous kings oppressing the people, who would leave the capital and take refuge in the frontier districts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tenth dream was of rice cooking in a pot, which rice, instead of cooking evenly, remained in three parts: some sodden, some raw, some well cooked; this showed that in the future men of all classes, even brahmins and sages, will be wicked, the very forces of nature will be against them, and their harvest will be spoiled.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The eleventh dream was of men bartering butter milk for precious sandal wood, and presaged a time when the Dhamma would decay and its votaries clamour for money and gifts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The twelfth dream was of empty pumpkins sinking in the water; the world will be reversed: the low born will become great lords and the noble sink into poverty.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the thirteenth dream solid blocks of rock floated in the water; nobles and wise men will be scorned while upstarts shall have their own way.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the fourteenth dream tiny frogs chewed huge snakes and ate them; a time will come when men, because of their lusts, will become the slaves of their wives and be ruled by them.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fifteenth dream was of a wicked village crow attended by mallards; kings will arise, ignorant and cowardly, who will rise to power, not their peers, but their footmen, barbers, and the like; nobles will be reduced to waiting on these upstarts.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the sixteenth dream goats chased panthers, devouring them; the lowborn will be raised to lordship and nobles will sink into obscurity and distress; when the latter plead for their rights, the king's minions will have them cudgelled and bastinadoed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having thus explained the dreams, the Buddha told Pasenadi a story of the past.  A king of Benares, named Brahmadatta, had dreams similar to those of Pasenadi.  When he consulted the brahmins, they began to prepare sacrifices.  A young brahmin protested, saying that animal sacrifice was against the teaching of the Vedas, but they would not listen.  The Bodhisatta, who was a hermit in the Himālaya, possessed of insight, became aware of what was happening, travelled through the air and took his seat in the park.  There he was seen by a young brahmin, who brought the king to the park.  The Bodhisatta heard the king's dreams and explained them to his satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the king and Sāriputta the young brahmin.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahākosala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Kosala.  He was the father of Pasenadi, and his daughter, Kosaladevī, was given in marriage to Bimbisāra, who received a village in Kāsi for her bath money (J.ii.237, 403; iv.342; SA.i.120, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggīdatta was the purohita of Mahākosala.  DhA.iii.241.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Kappina Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered foremost among those who taught the monks (bhikkuovādakānam) (A.i.25).  He was older than the Buddha, and was born in a frontier kingdom three hundred yojanas in extent, in the city of Kukkutavatī.  On the death of his father he became rājā under the name of Mahā Kappina.  His chief wife was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anojaa,Anojā')"&gt;Anojā&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala,Sāgala')"&gt;Sāgala&lt;/a&gt; in the Madda kingdom.  She had been his companion in good works in past births.  Every morning Mahā Kappina would send men out of the four gates of the city to stop any scholarly or learned men who might happen to pass along the road, and then to return and tell him of them.  He owned five horses: Vāla, Puppha, Vālavāhana, Pupphavāhana and Supatta.  Supatta he alone rode, the others were used by his messengers.  One day, after the Buddha's appearance in the world, traders came from Sāvatthi to Kukkutavatī and, after disposing of their goods, went to see Mahā Kappina.  He received them and asked them about their country and the teaching (sāsana) which they followed.  "Sire," they replied, “we cannot tell you with unwashed mouths." A golden jug of water was brought, and with cleansed mouths and clasped hands they told the king of the appearance of the Buddha.  At the word "Buddha" Kappina's body was suffused with rapture.  He made them utter the word three times, giving them one hundred thousand pieces.  The men told him also of the Dhamma and the Sangha, and he trebled his gifts and forthwith renounced the world, followed by his ministers.  They set forth to find the Buddha, and reached the bank of a river which they crossed by an "Act of Truth," saying, "If this teacher be a Sammāsambuddha, let not even a hoof of these horses be wetted." In this manner they crossed three rivers: the Aravacchā, the Nīlavāhana (q.v.), and the Candabhāgā.  The Buddha perceived them with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Sāvatthi, went through the air to the banks of the Candabhāgā (one hundred and twenty yojanas, says J.iv.180; see also SNA.ii.440) and sat down under the great banyan tree facing the landing stage of the river, sending forth Buddha rays.  Kappina and his men saw him and prostrated themselves.  The Buddha taught them the Doctrine, and they became arahants and joined the Order, the formula "Ehi bhikkhu" being their sanction and their ordination.  But see Vsm.393, where it says that at the end of the sermon Kappina became only an anāgāmin and his followers sotāpannas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anojā and the wives of Kappina's ministers hearing that their husbands had renounced the world and gone to see the Buddha, determined to do likewise.  They crossed the river in the same way as Kappina and his retinue, and approached the Buddha as he sat under the banyan tree on the banks of the Candabhāgā.  The Buddha made the husbands and wives invisible to each other and preached to the latter.  They became sotāpannas and were ordained by Uppalavannā, the Buddha taking the monks to Jetavana.  Mahā Kappina spent his days in the ecstasy of jhāna, and so full of happiness was he that he constantly repeated "aho sukham, aho sukham," which made the monks suspect that he was longing for the pleasures of kingship which he had left behind, until the Buddha dispelled their doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day the Buddha discovered that Kappina lived inactively, enjoying his happiness, and that he never taught anybody.  (Vin.i.105 records that when Kappina was in the Deer Park at Maddakucchi he wondered whether he need attend the uposatha ceremonies, since he himself was pure).  The Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go.  He sent for him and asked him to teach the Doctrine to his associates.  This Kappina did, and at the end of a single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title conferred on him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Kappina had registered a vow to become chief among admonishers of monks, having seen a similar honour conferred on a disciple of the Buddha.  He was at that time an assessor (akkhadassa) of Hamsavatī, and having invited the Buddha and his monks entertained them with great honour.  In another birth he was a Koliyan, and waited upon five hundred Pacceka Buddhas and gave them robes.  The story of the entertainment of the Pacceka Buddhas is given at length in DhA.ii.112ff., and the number given there is one thousand.  They came to Benares, but the king, occupied with the ploughing festival, asked them to return on the third day.  The wife of the senior weaver of a village near by heard this and invited the Pacceka Buddhas to her village, where there were one thousand artisans.  On the invitation being accepted, she returned quickly to the village, told the people of what she had done, and they all made the necessary preparations, each family looking after one Pacceka Buddha.  The Pacceka Buddhas, by their own wish, stayed on for three months, the same woman seeing to all their comforts.  At the end of their visit, she persuaded each family to give a set of robes to its own Pacceka Buddha.  The senior weaver was Kappina and his wife Anojā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he was the leader of a guild of one thousand men and built a great parivena containing one thousand rooms.  AA.i.175ff.; ThagA.i.507ff.; SA.ii.172ff.; DhA.ii.117ff.  gives a more detailed and slightly different version; ep.  Avadānas.ii.102f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.ii.115f) that once Kassapa Buddha was preaching and that all the householders of Benares, with their families, went to hear him.  Scarcely had they entered the monastery when there was a heavy downpour of rain.  Those who had friends among the novices and monks found shelter in their cells, the others were unprotected.  The senior householder then suggested that they should build a great monastery so that all might be sheltered in future; the others agreeing, he himself gave one thousand, each of the other men five hundred, and each woman two hundred and fifty.  The monastery had one thousand pinnacles, and when money ran short, each gave half as much again.  At the dedication ceremony the festival lasted for seven days.  The senior householder's wife, Anojā, offered the Buddha a casket of anoja flowers and placed at his feet a garment of the colour of the flowers worth one thousand, and made a wish that in future births her body should be of the colour of the anoja flower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Kappina was famed as a teacher of monks, the Theragāthā, curiously enough, contains verses in which he admonishes the nuns (bhikkhuniyo) (Thag.vss.  547 556; ThagA.i.511).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale (? odāta), thin, and having a prominent nose (tanukam tunganāsikam).  He possessed great iddhi-powers and had attained every samāpatti, which could be attained (J.ii.284).  (It was owing to his iddhi powers that he was able to follow the Buddha to the Brahma world, S.i.145; see also S.v.315, where he is described as samādhibhāvanīya).  It has been remarked (Brethren, p.257 n.2) that the verses attributed to him are, for the most part, more gnomic sayings of popular philosophy than genuine Dhamma, and that they would have befitted an early Greek Pagan.  Mrs.  Rhys Davids (J.R.A.S.  1927, ii.p.206f; also Sākya, p.140) has an interesting theory that Kappina was Assaji's teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahā Kappina was quite often in the company of Sāriputta, and it is said (Thag.vs.1086) that once, seeing the profound homage the gods payed to his colleague, he smiled by way of congratulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Kappina Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahātittha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahātittha.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin village in Magadha, the birthplace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā-Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā-Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;.  ThagA.ii.141; AA.i.99; SA.ii.143.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahātittha.&lt;/b&gt; The name of Mahāmeghavana in the time of Kakusandha Buddha.  It was presented to the Buddha by king Abhaya, who planted in it a branch of the Bodhi tree brought by Rucānandā.  Mhv.xv.  58, 73f., 83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Mahātittha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landing place on the west coast of Ceylon.  The wives brought from Madhurā for Vijaya and his companions landed there, hence the name (Mhv.vii.58; see Mhv.Trs.60, n.1).  There landed also in later times Bhalluka, from South India (Mhv.xxv.79), the Damilas and others who invaded Ceylon (Mhv.xxxiii.39; Cv.lviii.14; Cv.xi.37; Cv.lxxxviii.63).  It was probably the chief port f or vessels plying between South India and Ceylon.  Thus, it was from there that Sakkasenāpati embarked for the Pandu country (Cv.lii.73), and there that the Pandu king landed from Cola (Cv.liii.5).  The expeditionary force of Vijayabāhu I.  embarked there for Cola (Cv.lx.34), as did the forces of Parakkamabāhu I.  under Lankāpura (Cv.lxxvi.83).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a convenient place for preparations to be made before advancing on the capital, or merely journeying thither (thus Cv.lxviii.81; Cv.li.28).  It was a place of strategic importance, and when Māgha and Jayabāhu invaded Ceylon, they set up fortifications there.  Cv.lxxxiii.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsīhanāda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the Mahāvana in Vesāli.  Sāriputta tells the Buddha that Sunakkhatta, who had recently left the Order, went about saying that there was nothing marvellous about the Buddha's knowledge and insight and that his teachings did not lead to the end of Ill.  The Buddha says that Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly and incapable of appreciating the good either of the Tathāgata or of his teachings.  He then issues his challenge to the effect that no one can deny to the Tathāgata the possession of ten powers, (balā) - which are enumerated - and the four confidences (vesārajjā).  The Tathāgata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear; he knows the various classifications of beings, the birth of beings, the way to Nibbāna; he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await different beings.  He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his practice of asceticism, in loathliness, in scrupulosity, in solitude.  No one has surpassed him in the practice of these things.  He has discovered, by experimentation, the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity comes by way of food, or offering, or ritual.  Though eighty years old and his body broken down, yet his powers of mind are at their prime; even if he must be carried on a litter, yet will his mind retain its powers (M.i.68 83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nāgasamāla, who is by, asks the Buddha for a title for the discourse, and the Buddha gives it the name of Lomahamsapariyāya.  cp.  Lomahamsa Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvālukagangā, Mahāgangā, Mahāvālukanadī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief river of Ceylon, the modern Mahāveliganga.  Viewed from the city of Anurādhapura, the right bank was called pāragangā and the left oragangā.  The river was of great strategic importance, and is mentioned in various accounts of campaigns between opposing armies.  It was always regarded as the boundary between North Ceylon, with Anurādhapura (and later, Pulatthipura) as the centre, and the South east province of Rohana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various fords on this river are mentioned in the books, the chief among these being Kacchakatittha, Ganthambatittha, Mahārukkhatittha, Mālāgāmatittha, Yakkhasūkaratittha, Sarogāmatittha, Sahassatittha and Suvannatthambhatittha.  There were evidently other fords at the bends of the river with no particular names (e.g., Cv.lxxii.285).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kings of Ceylon constructed various canals branching off from the river to help in their irrigation schemes.  One such was the Pabbatanta Canal, built by Mahāsena (Mhv.xxxvii.50); while the Aciravatī, the Gomatī, and the Malāpaharani were constructed by Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxix.51f).  Dhātusena irrigated the surrounding fields by means of damming up the river (Cv.xxxviii.12), as did Sena II.  by the construction of the Manimekhala dam (Cv.li.72).  In the time of Parakkamabāhu II.  and, later, of Vijayabāhu IV., great ordination ceremonies were held on the river at Sahassatittha (Cv.lxxxvii.72; lxxxix.70f), and again at Ganthambatittha in the time of Vimaladhammasūriya I.  Cv.xciv.17; also Vimaladhammasūriya II.  (Cv.xcvii.12).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river rises in Samantakūta (Cv.c.82).  The Mahānāgavana of the Yakkhas, where, later, was erected the Mahiyangathūpa, was on the right bank of the river.  Cv.lxxxix.70; Mhv.Trs., p.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahādhammapāla Jātaka (No.  447)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Dhammapāla, a village of Kāsi, there lived a family whose head was Mahādhammapāla.  The Bodhisatta was his son, and was called Dhammapala-kumāra.  He went to study at Takkasilā.  There the teacher's eldest son died, but among all the lamentations it was noticed that Dhammapāla did not weep.  When questioned by his fellows as to how he could refrain, he answered that as it was impossible for anybody young to die, he did not believe his friend was dead.  The teacher asked him about this, and found that in Dhammapāla's family no one died young.  Wishing to know if this were true, he left Takkasilā and went to the home of Dhammapāla, carrying with him the bones of a goat.  After his welcome had subsided, he announced to Dhammapāla that his son was dead, and begged him not to grieve.  But Dhammapāla clapped his hands and laughed, saying that such a thing could never be as no member of their family ever died young.  He then told the brahmin, in answer to his query, that they owed their longevity to the fact that they lived good lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Suddhodana, who told the Buddha how, when the Buddha was practising severe penances, some gods came to him (Suddhodana) and said that he was dead.  But he refused to believe them.  Suddhodana was Mahādhammapāla and the teacher Sāriputta (J.iv.50 55).  At the conclusion of the Jātaka Suddhodana became an anāgāmī and Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī a sotāpanna.  DhA.i.99; J.i.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpajāpatī Gotami&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent Therī.  She was born at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadaha,Devadaha')"&gt;Devadaha&lt;/a&gt; in the family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; as the younger sister of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa,Mahāmāyā')"&gt;Mahāmāyā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ap.ii.538 says her father was Añjana Sakka and her mother Sulakkhanā.  Mhv.ii.18 says her father was Añjana and her mother &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasodharaa,Yasodharā')"&gt;Yasodharā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandapaanii,Dandapāni')"&gt;Dandapāni&lt;/a&gt; and Suppabuddha were her brothers; cp.  Dpv.xviii.7f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the birth of each sister, interpreters of bodily marks prophesied that their children would be cakkavattins.  King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; married both the sisters, and when Mahāmāyā died, seven days after the birth of the Buddha, Pajāpati looked after the Buddha and nursed him.  She was the mother of Nanda, but it is said that she gave her own son to nurses and herself nursed the Buddha.  The Buddha was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; when Suddhodana died, and Pajāpatī decided to renounce the world, and waited for an opportunity to ask the permission of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajāpatī was already a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;.  She attained this eminence when the Buddha first visited his father's palace and preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahadhammapala_jat_447,Mahādhammapāla Jātaka')"&gt;Mahādhammapāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.97).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her opportunity came when the Buddha visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt; to settle the dispute between the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya,Sākiyans')"&gt;Sākiyans&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/koliyaa,Koliyans')"&gt;Koliyans&lt;/a&gt; as to the right to take water from the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rohini,Rohinī')"&gt;Rohinī&lt;/a&gt;.  When the dispute had been settled, the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalahavivaada_s,Kalahavivāda Sutta')"&gt;Kalahavivāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, and five hundred young Sākiyan men joined the Order.  Their wives, led by Pajāpatī, went to the Buddha and asked leave to be ordained as nuns.  This leave the Buddha refused, and he went on to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;.  But Pajāpatī and her companions, nothing daunted, had barbers to cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot.  They arrived with wounded feet at the Buddha's monastery and repeated their request.  The Buddha again refused, but Ananda interceded on their behalf and their request was granted, subject to eight strict conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details see Vin.ii.253ff.; also A.iv.274ff.  There was some question, which arose later as to the procedure of Pajāpatī's ordination, which was not formal.  When the nuns discovered this some of them refused to hold the uposatha with her.  But the Buddha declared that he himself had ordained her and that all was in order (DhA.iv.149).  Her upasampadā consisted in acquiescing in the eight conditions laid down for nuns (Sp.i.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and worshipped him.  The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for meditation.  With this topic she developed insight and soon after won arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after listening to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandakovada_s,Nandakovāda Sutta')"&gt;Nandakovāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who had experience (rattaññūnam) (A.i.25).  Not long after, while at Vesāli, she realized that her life had come to an end.  She was one hundred and twenty years old; she took leave of the Buddha, performed various miracles, and then died, her five hundred companions dying with her.  It is said that the marvels which attended her cremation rites were second only to those of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha that Pajāpatī made her resolve to gain eminence.  She then belonged to a clansman's family in Hamsavatī, and, hearing the Buddha assign the foremost place in experience to a certain nun, wished for similar recognition herself, doing many good deeds to that end.  After many births she was born once more at Benares, forewoman among five hundred slave girls.  When the rains drew near, five Pacceka Buddhas came from Nandamūlaka to Isipatana seeking lodgings.  Pajāpatī saw them after the Treasurer had refused them any assistance, and, after consultation with her fellow slaves, they persuaded their several husbands to erect five huts for the Pacceka Buddhas during the rainy season and they provided them with all requisites.  At the end of the rains they gave three robes to each Pacceka Buddha.  After that she was born in a weaver's village near Benares, and again ministered, this time to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati,Padumavatī')"&gt;Padumavatī&lt;/a&gt; (ThigA.140ff.; AA.i.185f.; Ap.ii.529 43).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate.  But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole.  Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; intervened.  But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future.  This was the occasion for the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaavibhanga_s,Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta')"&gt;Dakkhināvibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.253ff.; MA.ii.1001ff.; this incident is referred to in the Milinda p.240).  The Buddha had a great love for Pajāpatī, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to visit her and preach to her - that being against the rule - the Buddha amended the rule and went himself to preach to her (Vin.iv.56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pajāpatī's name appears several times in the Jātakas.  She was the mother monkey in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_nandiya_jat_222,Cūla Nandiya Jātaka')"&gt;Cūla Nandiya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.202), Candā in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_dhammapaala_jat_358,Culla Dhammapāla')"&gt;Culla Dhammapāla&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.182), and Bhikkhudāyikā (or Bhikkhudāsikā) daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kikii,Kiki')"&gt;Kiki&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares (J.vi.481).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāpajāpatī was so called because, at her birth, augerers prophesied that she would have a large following; Gotamī was her gotta name (MA.i.1001; cp.  AA.ii.774).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story related of a nurse employed by Pajāpatī and born in Devadaha.  She renounced the world with Pajāpatī, but for twenty five years was harassed by thoughts of lust till, at last, she heard &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammadinnaa,Dhammadinnā')"&gt;Dhammadinnā&lt;/a&gt; preach.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;She then practiced meditation and became an arahant.  ThigA.75f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahābodhi Jātaka (No.  528)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born in an Udiccabrahmin family, and, on growing up, renounced the world.  His name was Bodhi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, during the rains, he came to Benares, and, at the invitation of the king, stayed in the royal park.  The king had five councillors, unjust men, who sat in the judgment hall giving unjust judgments.  One day a man, who had been very badly treated by them, asked Bodhi to intervene.  Bodhi reheard the case and decided in his favour.  The people applauded, and the king begged Bodhi to dispense justice in his court.  Bodhi reluctantly agreed and twelve years passed.  The former councillors, deprived of their gains, plotted against Bodhi and constantly poisoned the king's mind against him; they first decreased all the honours paid to Bodhi, and when this failed to drive him away, obtained the king's permission to kill him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tawny dog, to whom Bodhi used to give food from his bowl, overheard the plot, and, when Bodhi approached the palace the next day, bared his teeth and barked as a warning of the conspiracy.  Bodhi understood, returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king's expression of remorse, left the city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village.  The councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and the queen were conspiring to slay him.  Believing their words, he had the queen put to death.  The queen's four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was in great danger and fear.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park.  The king came to do him honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin.  The king asked him why he did so.  He answered, "This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(He had used the skin for his garment, hence "I sat on the monkey's back"; he had the skin on his shoulder, whence his water pot was suspended, hence "it carried the water pot"; he had swept the cell with the skin, hence "swept my dwelling place"; he had eaten the flesh of the monkey, hence "I ate its flesh").  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The councillors who were present made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor.  But Bodhi knew that of these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should secure one's interests, even to the extent of killing one's parents.  He, therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey.  Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in slanderers, and asked the king's sons to obtain their father's pardon.  The king wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546,Mahāummagga Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāummagga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahādhana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahādhana.  &lt;/b&gt; The son of the Treasurer of Benares.  His parents possessed eighty crores, and, for all education, he learnt music and singing.  He married the daughter of an equally rich family and of similar education.  After the death of their parents, they were very rich.  One night, as the husband was on his way from the palace, some knaves tempted him to drink.  He soon fell a victim to the habit and all his wealth was squandered.  Then he spent his wife's money, and finally sold all his belongings, and used to go about begging, a potsherd in his hand.  One day the Buddha, seeing him waiting outside the refectory for leavings of food, smiled.  In answer to Ananda, who asked him the reason for his smile, the Buddha said that there was a man who had had the power of becoming chief Treasurer or attaining arahantship, if he did but use his opportunities, but he was now reduced to beggary, like a heron in a dried up pond.  DhA.iii.129ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahādhana.  &lt;/b&gt; A merchant of Sāvatthi.  Five hundred thieves once attempted unsuccessfully to enter his house, but hearing that he was about to travel through a forest with five hundred carts laden with goods, they lay in wait for him.  The merchant took with him five hundred monks and entertained them in a village at the entrance to the forest.  As he tarried there several days, the thieves sent a man to find out when he might be setting out, which he learnt would be soon.  The villagers warned the merchant of the thieves' intention, and he gave up the idea of the journey and decided to return home.  But on hearing that the thieves were lying in ambush on tile homeward road, he stayed in the village.  The monks returned to Jetavana and told the Buddha, who taught them that men should avoid evil even as Mahādhana avoided thieves.  DhA.iii.21f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahādhana.&lt;/b&gt; A merchant of Benares.  On his way to Sāvatthi with five hundred carts filled with cloth of the colour of safflower, he came to the river and unyoked his oxen, thinking to cross on the morrow.  In the night it rained and there was a flood.  For seven days the rain continued, and Mahādhana decided to stay until his wares were sold and then return home.  The Buddha, on his begging rounds, saw him and smiled.  When asked the reason by Ananda, he said that the man, in spite of all his plans, had only seven days to live.  With the Buddha's permission, Ananda warned Mahādhana, who thereupon invited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them.  At the end of the meal the Buddha preached to him and he became a Sotāpanna.  Shortly after he was seized with pain in the head and died immediately, to be re born in Tusita.  DhA.iii.429f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahādhana&lt;/b&gt;.  A very rich man of Rājagaha.  He had only one son, to whom he taught nothing, in case he should weary of learning.  The boy, when grown up, married a woman likewise of no education.  After the death of his father, he squandered all his wealth and sought refuge in a destitute's home (anāthasālā).  Thieves saw him there, and as he was young and strong enlisted his services.  One night the thieves broke into a house, but the owner awoke and pursued them, catching Mahādhana's son, who was brought before the king.  The king ordered him to be beheaded.  The courtesan of the city, Sulasā, saw him being led to execution, and remembering their past friendship, gave him sweetmeats and drink, bribing the guard to let him have them.  At that moment Moggallāna, seeing the youth's fate with his divine eye, appeared before him and was given some sweetmeats.  After execution, the man was born as a tree sprite, and one day carried &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sulasaa,Sulasā')"&gt;Sulasā&lt;/a&gt; off as she was walking in the park and kept her for a week.  Sulasā's mother consulted Moggallāna on her disappearance, and was told she would return to Veluvana at the end of a week, When the time came, the sprite brought Sulasā back and left her on the edge of the crowd which was listening to the Buddha's preaching at Veluvana.  Sulasā was recognised, and recounted what had happened.  The Buddha made this a topic for a sermon, which benefited many beings.  Pv.i.1; PvA.3ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahādhana.&lt;/b&gt; Sixty five kappas ago there were four kings of this name, all previous births of Tinasanthāradāyaka Thera.  Ap.i.198.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsubhaddā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsubhaddā.&lt;/b&gt; Chief wife of the Bodhisatta when he was the elephant king Chaddanta.  J.v.37, 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsubhaddā.&lt;/b&gt; Eldest daughter of Anāthapindika.  Before her marriage she waited on the monks who came to her father's house and became a sotāpanna (DhA.i.128; J.i.93).  According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.146, 148f ) she married an unbeliever, a householder of Ugganagara, and the Buddha, at her request, went to her house with five hundred monks (chief among whom was Kundadhāna) to receive alms.  But see Cūla Subhaddā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāsubhaddā.&lt;/b&gt; Chief queen of Mahāsudassana (q.v.).

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpadāna Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourteenth sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya.  It gives an account of the general events attendant on the advent of a Buddha, and gives various facts connected with the Buddhas, with details of seven Buddhas by way of illustration.  But it is only the life of Vipassī, the first of the seven Buddhas preceding Gotama, which is at all elaborately treated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached at the Karerimandapa in Jetavana, and was the result of a conversation among the monks, in which they expressed the desire to know something of the births of previous Buddhas (D.ii.6 54).  It is noteworthy that the Cullaniddesa (p.  80) cites the sutta as a typical example of the earlier Jātakas.  Some regard it as the basis of the Mahāvastu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is held in great esteem and is called in the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.480) the "King of Suttas" (Suttantarājā), because no other sutta contains so many bhānvāras (one hundred and twenty six).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāariyavamsa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the four Ariyan lineages, reckoned as ancient and pure, and held in esteem by discerning recluses and brahmins of all times.  A monk is content with any kind of robe; he does not, for the sake of robes, resort to unseemly conduct; he is free from either selfishness or greed with regard to robes; neither does he exalt himself because of his contentment.  So it is with other requisites.  He also delights in abandoning and in bhāvanā.  A monk possessed of these four Ariyavamsā verily becomes a sage, praised by Brahmā himself (A.ii.27ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was evidently a favourite topic for a sermon (AA.i.385, 386).  The Commentary explains (AA.ii.494) how, for instance, anyone who preaches on the first three Ariyavamsā (catupaccayasantosa) could bring the whole Vinaya Pitaka to bear on the discussion, while a discussion on the bhāvanārāma-ariyavamsa could include the two other Pitakas, chiefly the nekkhammapāli of the Patisambhidāmagga, the Dasuttara Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, the Satipatthāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the Niddesapariyāya of the Abhidhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full name of the sutta seems to have been Catupaccayasantosabhāvanārāma Mahāariyavamsa Sutta (AA.i.385).  It was also probably called Vamsa Sutta for short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is probably this Mahāariyavamsa Sutta which was held in such high esteem by Vohāraka Tissa, that he ordered almsgiving throughout Ceylon whenever the "Ariyavamsa" was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; but see Mhv.Trs.258, n.  6).  It is said that people would journey five yojanas to hear a monk preach the Ariyavamsa (E.g., AA.i.386), and mention is made of Mahāariyavamsabhānakā, who, judging from the stories of them (E.g., SA.iii.151), were extremely able and eloquent preachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpabbata&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāpabbata.&lt;/b&gt; The state elephant of Elāra.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsamaya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāsamaya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavana,Mahāvana')"&gt;Mahāvana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying with five hundred arahants.  The gods of the ten thousand world systems had come to visit the Buddha and the monks, and were joined by four gods from the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhavaasa,Suddhāvāsā')"&gt;Suddhāvāsā&lt;/a&gt;, who saluted the Buddha in verse.  The Buddha then addressed the monks and recited this sutta (D.ii.253-62).  It is possible to divide the discourse into three parts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first contains a list of the devas and other beings present to worship the Buddha.  It is a long list of strange names given in verses, mostly doggerel.  Many of the beings mentioned are to us now mere names, with no special information attached.  Most of them were probably local deities, the personification of natural phenomena, guardian spirits, fairies, harpies, naiads, dryads, and many others, who are here represented as adherents of the Buddha, come to do him honour.  It is noteworthy that even the most important gods - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma,Soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna,Varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"&gt;Brahmā&lt;/a&gt;- are only incidentally mentioned, added to the list, as it were, without special distinction.  A similar list of devas is found in the Mahavastu (i.  245; iii.68, 77); the addition of Siva to this list is significant.  The list of gods given in the Mahāsamaya should be compared with that given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s,Atānātiya Sutta')"&gt;Atānātiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the sutta is the framework of the words attributed to the Buddha, introducing the list of devas, giving the Buddha's warning to the monks to beware of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt; and Māra's declaration that he had no power over them as arahants are free from fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third part of the sutta may be called the prologue, the verses of greeting spoken by the devas from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhaavaasaa,Suddhāvāsā')"&gt;Suddhāvāsā&lt;/a&gt; (Rhys Davids, Dial.ii.282f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prologue is elsewhere preserved as a separate episode (S.i.27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries give long accounts of the preaching of the Mahāsamya (E.g., SNA.  357ff.; DA.ii.672ff).  The arahants mentioned are Sākiyan and Koliyan youths, representatives of Sākiyan and Koliyan families, sent to join the Order as a sign of gratitude to the Buddha for having averted the quarrel between the two families regarding the water of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rohini,Rohinī')"&gt;Rohinī&lt;/a&gt;.  On that occasion the Buddha had preached to the opposing armies the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/attadanda_s,Attadanda Sutta')"&gt;Attadanda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phandana_jat_475,Phandana')"&gt;Phandana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/latukika_jat_357,Latukika')"&gt;Latukika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vattaka_jat_35_118_394,Vattaka Jātakas')"&gt;Vattaka Jātakas&lt;/a&gt; (DA.ii.674 adds the Pathavuddriyana and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rukkhadhamma_jat_074,Rukkhadhamma Jātakas')"&gt;Rukkhadhamma Jātakas&lt;/a&gt;).  He then related the story of their origin, showing that both families were descended from a common stock.  When the quarrel was thus settled, two hundred and fifty young men from each family entered the Order and the Buddha dwelt with them in Mahāvana.  But the wives of the men tried to entice them back; the Buddha, therefore, took them to Himavā, where he preached to them the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536,Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of the Kunāla Lake.  At the conclusion of the sermon they attained to various fruits of the Path, from anāgāmī-phala to sotāpatti.  He then returned with them to Mahāvana, where they developed insight and became arahants.  They assembled to pay homage to their teacher on the evening of the full moon day of Jetthamāsa, and to the assembly came the devas of the ten thousand world systems.  The Buddha told the monks the names of the devas present (as given in the Mahāsamaya), and, surveying the assembly, saw that it consisted of two kinds of beings, one capable of benefiting by his teaching (bhabbā), and the other not so capable (abhabbā).  The bhabbā, he saw, could be divided into six groups - the rāgacaritā and the dosa moha vitakka saddhā buddhi caritā, according to temperament.  To these, respectively, he preached six suttas, calculated to benefit each separate class, and, in order that each sutta might take the form of question and answer, he created a Buddha form to ask questions, while he himself answered them.  The six suttas, so preached, were the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purabheda,Purābheda')"&gt;Purābheda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalahavivaada_s,Kalahavivāda')"&gt;Kalahavivāda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_viyuuha,Cūlavyūha')"&gt;Cūlavyūha&lt;/a&gt;, Mahāvyūha, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tuvataka_s,Tuvataka')"&gt;Tuvataka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sammaparibbajaniya_s,Sammāparibbājaniya')"&gt;Sammāparibbājaniya&lt;/a&gt;.  Countless numbers of beings realized the Truth (AA.i.173, 320; Mil.  20, 350; SNA.i.174).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta was among the incidents of the Buddha's life sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahathupa,Mahā Thūpa')"&gt;Mahā Thūpa&lt;/a&gt;.  Mhv.xxx.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāsamaya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sammaparibbajaniya_s,Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta')"&gt;Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāmunda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāmunda&lt;/b&gt;.  See Munda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāmunda.&lt;/b&gt; A lay disciple of Munda, in Viñjhatavi.  He was the friend and patron of Anuruddha and had two children, Mahāsumana and Cullasumana.  Anuruddha visited him because he wished to ordain Cullasumana (q.v.).  DhA.iv.128&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāli Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahāli Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Licchavi Otthaddha (Mahāli) visits the Buddha at the Kutāgārasālā and reports to him a conversation he had had with Sunakkhatta, who claimed to be able to see heavenly forms but not to hear heavenly sounds.  Mahāli inquires how such a faculty can be acquired, and the Buddha tells him, but explains that it is not for the sake of acquiring these powers that people join the Order.  Asking what then is their object, he gradually leads the conversation on to the question of arahantship, along the Eightfold Path.  The Buddha then raises a quite different question, as to whether the soul and the body are identical.  The discourse on this again leads to the question of arahantship (cp.  Jāliya Sutta), but it is significant that the Buddha leaves this last question unanswered (D.i.150 8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.316) that the Buddha raised the point of body and soul, because he knew that Mahāli harboured the heretical belief that a soul exists and that it has form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāli Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Licchavi Mahāli visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and questions him regarding the doctrine of Pūrana Kassapa that there is no cause or condition for the impurity of beings.  The Buddha contradicts this view, and explains that it is because beings take delight in the body, etc., that they become impure.  When they feel revulsion towards the body, etc., they become pure.  S.iii.68f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāli Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Buddha, in answer to a question of Mahāli, says that greed, ill will, dullness cause the continuance of evil action, and right reflection and a well poised mind cause the continuance of good.  The existence of these two different sets of qualities cause the good and evil in the world.  A.v.86f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsuka Jātaka (No.  429)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of the parrots and lived in a fig tree grove in the Himālaya.  After some time the fruits of the trees on which he lived came to an end, but he still lived on there, eating bark or shoots or whatever else he could find.  Sakka's throne was heated, and Sakka, assuming the form of a goose and accompanied by Sujā, visited the parrot and asked why he did not go elsewhere.  The parrot answered that he did not wish to forsake old friends, and Sakka, pleased with this answer, promised him a boon.  The parrot asked that the fig tree be made fruitful again, and this Sakka did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had a pleasant dwelling place near a village, but who found alms difficult to get, the villagers becoming very poor.  He became very discontented, but the Buddha asked him not to forsake his dwelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sakka of the story is identified with Anuruddha (J.iii.490 4).  According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.283ff), the story was related to Nigamavāsī Tissa (q.v.) and Sakka is identified with Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahārakkhita &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahārakkhita Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He went after the Third Council to the Yona country, and there preached the Kālakārama Sutta.  One hundred and seventy thousand people adopted the Buddha's faith and ten thousand entered the Order.  Mhv.xii.5, 39; Dpv.viii.9; Sp.i.64, 67.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahārakkhita.  &lt;/b&gt; An ascetic in Himavā.  See the Somanassa Jātaka.  He is identified with Sāriputta.  J.iv.454.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahārakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Incumbent of Uparimandalaka (J.vi.30).  See Mahā-Sangharakkhita (3).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahārakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; When told by his patron that the latter had given a robe to a certain monk, he praised him; when the man offered to give him one, he praised that likewise.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsīlava Jātaka (No.  51)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares under the name of Mahāsīlava.  He built six almonries and ruled in all goodness.  One of his ministers, having intrigued with a member of his harem, was expelled and took service under the king of Kosala.  He caused several bands of ruffians to invade the territory of Mahāsīlava at different times.  When they were caught and brought before Mahāsīlava, the latter gave them money and sent them away, telling them to act differently in the future.  In this way the king of Kosala was easily persuaded by his minister that Mahāsīlava's kingdom could easily be captured.  He therefore set out with an army, and as the people of Mahāsīlava were allowed to offer no resistance, the king and his ministers were captured alive and buried up to their necks in the cemetery.  In the night, when jackals approached to eat them, Mahāsīlava fastened his teeth in the neck of the jackal that came to him.  The jackal started howling and his companions fled.  In his struggles to get free, the jackal loosened the earth round Mahāsīlava, who managed to free himself and then his companions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cemetery two Yakkhas were having a dispute about a dead body, and they asked Mahāsīlava to settle it.  But he wished first to bathe, and they fetched him water and perfumes and food from the usurper's table in Benares and also his sword of state.  With this he cut the body in half, giving half to each Yakkha, and, with their aid, he entered the usurper's room where he slept.  When the latter showed signs of terror, Mahāsīlava told him of what had happened and granted him forgiveness.  His kingdom was then restored, and Mahāsīlava exhorted his subjects on the virtues of perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a backsliding monk.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; is identified with the treacherous minister of the Jātaka.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahādeva &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahādeva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; The Chief Disciple of Padumuttara Buddha.  AA.i.114; but Bu.xi.24 calls him Devala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahādeva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; A disciple of Kakusandha Buddha, whom he accompanied to Ceylon, and who was left behind by the Buddha to look after the converts.

After the Third Council he went as apostle to Mahisamandala, where he preached the Devadūta Sutta, converting forty thousand people and conferring ordination on forty thousand more.  Mhv.xii.3, 29; Dpv.viii.5; Sp.i.66.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mahādeva.  &lt;/b&gt; A minister of Asoka, whose counsel was followed by Asoka in the arrangements for the despatch of a branch of the Bodhi-tree to Ceylon.  Mhv.xviii.20.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Mahādeva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was from Pallavabhogga, and was present with four hundred and sixty thousand monks at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa.  Mhv.xxix.38.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Mahādeva Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was an incumbent of Bhaggari, and was among those who were the last to become arahants after renouncing the world with the Bodhisatta in previous births.  J.iv.490.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahādeva Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; From Dāmahālaka.  King Sanghatissa heard him one day preach the merits of giving rice gruel, and thereupon instituted an abundant gift of rice gruel to the monks at the gates of Anurādhapura.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpadesa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the Ananda cetiya in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhogagamanagara,Bhoganagara')"&gt;Bhoganagara&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells the monks of the four mahāpadesā to be respected by them.  If a monks says he has a certain teaching direct from the Buddha himself, his statement should be compared with the rest of the Vinaya and Dhamma; if these do not agree, it should be rejected; if they do, accepted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same applies to that which is said to have been learnt from a group of monks led by a Thera from a body of senior monks residing in a certain place, or from a single senior monk, proficient in the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mātikā.  A.ii.167ff.; the sutta is incorporated in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaparinibbana_s,Mahāparinibbāna Sutta')"&gt;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.123ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsanghikā, Mahāsangītikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Buddhist schools which separated out from the Theravādins at the Second Council.  The members rejected the Parivāra, the six sections of the Abhidhamma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa and some portions of the Jātakas (KvuA.  p.  4; Dpv.v.32ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school was so called owing to the great number of its followers, which made a great assembly or "Mahāsangitī." They were counted among the Anātmavādins, and later gave rise to the following schools: the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mahāsanghika, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pubbasela, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aparasela, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rājagiriyā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hemavatas, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cetiyavādins, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sankantivādins and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gokulikas.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally they had only two divisions the Ekabbohārikas and Gokulikas (Rockhill, op.  cit., 182ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their separation from the orthodox school was brought about by the Vajjiputta monks, and was probably due to difference of opinion on the ten points (for these see Vin.ii.294f) held by the Vajjiputta monks.  According to Northern sources, however, the split occurred on the five points raised by Mahādeva: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) An arahant may commit a sin under unconscious temptation; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) one may be an arahant and unconscious of the fact; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) an arahant may have doubts on matters of doctrine; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) one cannot attain arahantship without the help of a teacher; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(5) the "Noble Way" may begin with some such exclamation as "How sad!" uttered during meditation (J.R A.S.  1910, p.  416; cf.  MT 173).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These articles of faith are found in the Kathāvatthu (173ff., 187ff., 194, 197), attributed to the Pubbaselas and the Aparaselas, opponents of the Mahāsanghika school.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal.ii.164), the Mahāsanghikas divided their canon into five parts: Sūtra, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, Miscellaneous and Dhāranī.  Fa Hsien took from Pātaliputta to China a complete transcript of the Mahāsanghika Vinaya.  (Giles, p.  64, Nañjio's Catalogue mentions a Mahāsanghika Vinaya and a Mahāsanghabhiksunī Vinaya in Chinese translations, Cola.  247, 253. Ms.  No.543).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best known work of the Mahāsanghikas is the Mahāvastu.  Their headquarters in Ceylon were in Abhayagiri vihāra, and Sena I.  is said to have built the Vīrankurārāma for their use.  Cv.1.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

There is no sutta of this name, but the reference is evidently to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha_s_samy,Anuruddha Sutta')"&gt;Anuruddha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iv.227ff), which the Buddha preached to Anuruddha who was then dwelling among the Cetis in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya,Pācīnavamsamigadāya')"&gt;Pācīnavamsamigadāya&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anuruddha was meditating on the seven purisa-vitakkā, and the Buddha appeared before him and taught him the eighth &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- that the Dhamma is for the precise and for one who delights in exactness, not for the diffuse or for him who delights in diffuseness.  The Buddha later addresses the monks of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumsumaaragiri,Sumsumāragiri')"&gt;Sumsumāragiri&lt;/a&gt; and tells them of the eight mahā-purisa-vitakkā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Ananda asks the Buddha not to die in the "little wattle and daub" town of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusināra')"&gt;Kusināra&lt;/a&gt;, but in some important city, such as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/campaa,Campā')"&gt;Campā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;.  The Buddha tells him that Kusinārā was once Kusāvatī, the royal city of King Mahāsudassana, and was surrounded by seven ramparts, a city containing all the characteristics of a great capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāsudassana possessed the seven treasures of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakkavatti')"&gt;Cakkavatti&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkaratana,cakka ratana')"&gt;cakka ratana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the hatthi ratana (named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uposatha,Uposatha')"&gt;Uposatha&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the assa ratana (named &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/valaahaka,Valāhaka')"&gt;Valāhaka&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the mani ratana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the itthi ratana (pearl among women), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the gahapati ratana, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the parināyaka ratana.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also possessed four iddhi powers: he was handsome, long lived, free from disease, and beloved by all classes of people.  He had lotus ponds made all over his kingdom, food and clothing being placed on their banks for any who might require them.  With the money brought to the king by the people, Vissakamma, under Sakka's orders, built the Dhammapāsāda Palace, filled with all splendor and luxury.  The king possessed a gabled hall called Mahāvyūha, where he spent the hot part of the day.  In front of the Dhammapāsāda was the Dhammapokkharanī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having realized that his power and glory were the result of past good deeds, Mahāsudassana practiced generosity, self conquest and self-control, and developed the four jhānas, suffusing all quarters with thoughts of love and pity and sympathy and equanimity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāsudassana had eighty four thousand cities, the chief of which was Kusāvatī; eighty four thousand palaces, the chief being Dhammapāsāda; eighty four thousand gabled houses, the chief being Mahāvyūha; eighty four thousand state elephants, led by Uposatha; and eighty four thousand horses, led by Valāhaka.  He had eighty four thousand chariots led by Vejayanta, and eighty four thousand wives, of whom Subbaddā was the chief.  One day, the king realized that his death was approaching, and, when Subhaddā visited him to try and induce him to enjoy his pleasures, he stopped her, telling her to speak to him of the impermanence of things and the need for giving up all desire.  While she talked to him of these things, he died and was reborn in the Brahma world.  For eighty four thousand years be bad been a prince, a viceroy and a king respectively, and later, for forty eight thousand years, a devout layman in the Dhammapāsāda.  Mahāsudassana is identified with the Buddha (D.ii.169 99; the story is also referred to at S.iii.144).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sudassana had been a forester.  He met a monk in the forest and built a hut for him.  He also requested the monk to receive alms every day at his house or, at least, to eat there.  The monk agreed, and Sudassana made his hut comfortable in every way, constructing walks, bathing places, gardens, etc., outside.  He also gave him innumerable gifts, of various kinds and descriptions.  DA.ii.631f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

When he died the people were delighted, and burnt his body with one thousand cartloads of wood amidst great festivity.  They then elected his son, the Bodhisatta, as king.  He noticed that while all others rejoiced, the palace doorkeeper wept, and inquired the reason.  The man replied that Mahāpingala would strike him on the head in passing eight times a day.  He was sure, he would treat Yama in like fashion, and would be banished from hell and return to his palace where he would again start to assault him.  The Bodhisatta told the man it would be quite impossible for Mahāpingala to rise from hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the great joy shown by multitudes of people at the death of Devadatta.  Devadatta is identified with Mahāpingala.  J.ii.239ff.; DhA.i.126f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Mahāgavaccha admired Sāriputta greatly, and on learning that he had joined the Order, he followed Sāriputta's example, becoming an arahant in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he gave a drink of water to Padumuttara Buddha and was a devout follower of Sikhī Buddha (Thag.vs.12; ThagA.i.57).  He is probably identical with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.437; but the same verses are attributed to Gangātiriya (ThagA.i.249).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

On his death, the elder came to the throne and made his brother viceroy, but, later, suspecting him of treachery, had him put in chains.  Polajanaka escaped, and, when he had completed his preparations, laid siege to the city, killed Aritthajanaka, and seized the throne.  Aritthajanaka's wife escaped in disguise, taking with her a lot of treasures.  She was pregnant, and as her child was the Bodhisatta, Sakka's throne was heated, and he appeared before her as a charioteer and took her to Kālacampā.  There she was adopted by an Udicca brahmin as his sister and the child was born.  When he played with other boys they mocked at him, calling him the widow's son.  He asked his mother what this meant, but she put him off with evasive answers until one day he bit her on the breast and insisted on being told the truth.  When he was sixteen, she gave him half the treasures, and he embarked on a ship going to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi,Suvannabhūmi')"&gt;Suvannabhūmi&lt;/a&gt; for trade.  The ship was wrecked in mid ocean, but nothing daunted, Mahājanaka (as the boy was called) swam valiantly for seven days, till &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manimekhalaa,Manimekkhalā')"&gt;Manimekkhalā&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of the sea, admiring his courage, rescued him and placed him in the mango grove in Mithilā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Polajanaka had died and left orders that the throne should go to one who could find favour in the eyes of his daughter, should know which is the head of a square bed, could string the bow that required the strength of one thousand men, and could draw out the sixteen great treasures.  No one seemed forthcoming who was able to fulfil these conditions; the ministers thereupon decked the state chariot with the five insignia of royalty and sent it out, accompanied by music.  The car left the city gates, and the horses went to the mango grove and stopped at the spot where Mahājanaka lay asleep.  The chaplain, seeing the auspicious marks on his feet, awoke him, and explaining to him his mission, crowned him king.  When he entered the palace, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii,Sīvalī')"&gt;Sīvalī&lt;/a&gt; (the late king's daughter) was immediately won over by his appearance, and willingly agreed to be his queen.  He was told of the other conditions mentioned by the dead king; he solved the riddles contained in some and fulfilled them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time Sīvalī bore him a son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diighaavu,Dīghāvukumāra')"&gt;Dīghāvukumāra&lt;/a&gt;, whom, in due course, Mahājanaka made viceroy.  One day Mahājanaka went into his park, and noticing how a mango tree, which bore fruit had been plundered by his courtiers while another which was barren was left in peace, he realized that possessions meant sorrow, and retiring into a room, lived the ascetic life.  His life span was ten thousand years, of which three thousand still remained to him.  After living for four months in the palace, he resolved to renounce the world, and having made his preparations, secretly left the palace.  The queen met him on the stairs, but did not recognise him in his ascetic garb.  On discovering his absence, she ran after him and tried by many devices to persuade him to return, but in vain.  She then urged his people to follow him, but he turned them back.  She, however, would not obey him, and for sixty leagues she and the people followed Mahājanaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sage Nārada, dwelling in Himavā, saw Mahājanaka with his divine eye and encouraged him in his resolve, as did another ascetic, Migājina, who had just risen from a trance.  Thus they journeyed on till they reached the village of Thūnā.  There the king saw a dog running away with a morsel of roasted flesh, which it dropped in its flight.  The king picked it up, cleaned it, and ate it.  The queen, very disgusted, felt that he was not worthy to be a king.  Further on they saw a girl shaking sand in a winnowing basket; on one arm she wore a single bracelet, on the other arm, two.  The two bracelets jingled, while the single one was noiseless.  Mahājanaka pointed out the moral of this to Sīvalī, and she agreed to go a different way, but soon came running back to him and followed him till they came across a fletcher, straightening an arrow, looking at it with one eye only.  On being questioned by the king, he answered that the wide horizon of two eyes served but to distract the view.  But Sīvalī still refused to leave him till, on the edge of a forest, he told her there could be no more intercourse between them, and she fell senseless.  The king rushed into the forest, while the ministers revived the queen.  When she recovered the king was no more to be seen, and she returned to the city.  Thūpas were erected on various spots connected with the king's renunciation, and the queen lived as an ascetic in the royal garden of Mithilā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manimekhālā is identified with Uppalavannā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nārada with Sāriputta, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migājina with Moggallāna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the girl with Khemā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the fletcher with Ananda, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sīvalī with Rāhulamātā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dīghāvu with Rāhula, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;while Mahājanaka was the Bodhisatta (J.iii.30 68).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka exemplifies viriyapāramitā.

  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;1. Mahāpañha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of questions and answers forming an epitome of the Buddha's teachings; each question contains one statement (uddesa) and one exposition (veyyākarana), and so on, up to ten, which consists of ten subjects (dasa akusalakammapathā) put in one group (A.v.48ff).  It is probably this sutta which is referred to as the Mahāpañhā in the Anguttara Nikāya.  A.v.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.

She answers that she has heard neither the explanation of the Buddha nor that of the arahants, but she will explain them according to her own lights, and proceeds to do so.  The devotees report her explanation to the Buddha, who praises her wisdom and declares that his own explanation would have been identical.  A.v.54ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāsalayatana, Mahisalāyatanika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha instructs the monks on the necessity of acquiring the right kind of knowledge of the sense organs, their objects, their perception, their contact and the feelings arising there from.  Such knowledge enables a monk to traverse the Noble Eightfold Path to its perfected development and to the realization of transcendent knowledge, which is understanding and deliverance.

Mahāpaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha, chief of five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, all sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati,Padumavatī')"&gt;Padumavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  He alone was born of his mother's womb, the others being samsedajā.  After Padumavatī's rivals (for the earlier part of their story see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uppalavanna,Uppalavannā')"&gt;Uppalavannā&lt;/a&gt;) had placed the children in caskets which they launched down stream, they announced to the king that Padumavatī was a non human and had given birth to a log of wood.  He expelled her from the palace, and as she wandered about in the streets, deprived of all her glory, an old woman had pity on her, took her home, and looked after her.  The king was bathing in the river when the caskets containing the children got entangled in his nets, and, having taken them out and unlocked them, he found the babes inside, together with a letter from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; saying that they were the children of Padumavatī.  The king hastened back to his palace and issued a proclamation that anyone finding Padumavatī would receive one thousand as reward.  On Padumavatī's suggestion, the old woman, her protector, offered to find her, and Padumavatī then revealed herself.  She was conducted back to the palace in all glory, and her five hundred rivals were given to her as slaves.  She had them freed, and appointed them as nurses to look after her children, except Paduma (called Mahāpaduma), whom she nursed herself.  When Mahāpaduma and his brothers reached the age of sixteen, they went one day to the park, where they were impressed by the appearance of old and faded lotus among the fresh ones growing in the pond, and developing this topic of thought, they became Pacceka Buddhas and went to Nandamūla cave.  Padumavatī died of grief at the loss of all her sons and was reborn in a labourer's family.  She married, and, one day, while taking gruel to her husband, she saw eight Pacceka Buddhas (her sons in a previous birth) travelling through the air and descending near to where she stood.  She gave them the food intended for her husband and invited them for the next day.  The next day all the five hundred came to do honour to their mother and to accept her entertainment.  She fed them all and offered flowers to them (ThigA.185ff).  Afterwards Mahāpaduma and his brothers were entertained by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares, and his queen (who in their last birth were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadda_kapilani_thi,Bhaddā Kāpilānī')"&gt;Bhaddā Kāpilānī&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stayed in the royal park during the rains, and, one day, when the king was away, the queen visited them and found them dead.  ThagA.ii.140f.; SA.ii.142; AA.i.98,190ff.; MA.ii.889.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mahāpaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prince of Kumudanagara.  Sona Thera - who harboured enmity against Piyadassī Buddha, just as Devadatta did against Gotama - persuaded Paduma to kill his father, and devised various schemes for killing the Buddha, all of which failed.  In the end he sent his elephant Donamukha, drunk with toddy, to attack the Buddha, who, however, subdued the animal.  BuA.174; cp.  Ajātasattu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahāpaduma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk, but was later reborn as a Treasurer of Benares, in which life he committed adultery and was reborn in hell.  Later, he became the daughter of a treasurer and was given in marriage.  But, owing to her former misdeeds, her husband did not care for her and went with another woman to the fair.  One day, however, she begged her husband to take her, and he told her to make preparations.  This she did, and on the day of the feast, hearing that her husband had already gone to the park, she followed him with her servants, taking the food and drink she had prepared.  On the way she met a Pacceka Buddha, descended from her carriage, filled his bowl with food, placing a lotus on the top, and then offered him a handful of lotus.  When her gift was accepted, she made a vow that she should be born in a lotus and be of a lotus colour, should become a man and attain the deliverance of Nibbāna.  Her body instantly became beautiful, and her husband, who suddenly remembered her, sent for her, and from then on loved her exceedingly.  After death she was born in a lotus in the deva world and was called Mahāpaduma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his next birth, at the suggestion of Sakka, he was born in a lotus in the park of the king of Benares, whose queen was childless.  She saw the lotus in the pond, and conceiving a great affection for it, picked it and found the child within as if in a casket.  She adopted the child and brought him up in great luxury.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, while playing outside the palace gates, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and warned him not to enter the palace as they pressed all who entered to eat and drink.  The Pacceka Buddha turned away, and the boy was filled with remorse at the idea that the Pacceka Buddha should be offended, and went to his lodging, riding on an elephant, to ask his forgiveness.  On the way he descended from the elephant and went on foot.  Arrived near the dwelling of the Pacceka Buddha, he dismissed his attendants and went on alone.  He found the Pacceka Buddha's cell empty, and, sitting down, developed insight and became a Pacceka Buddha.  When his attendants came for him, he declared his attainment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His verse is included in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khaggavisaana,Khaggavisāna Sutta')"&gt;Khaggavisāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.

Mahāpaduma Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Preacher of Jātakas (Jātakabhānaka).  When Ilanāga was in Rohana, after fleeing from the capital, he heard the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapi_jat_250_404,Kapi Jātaka')"&gt;Kapi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapaduma,Mahāpaduma')"&gt;Mahāpaduma&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in Tulādhāra vihāra, and was greatly pleased.

See also Paduma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Mahāpaduma Thera.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of Ceylon.  Famous for his knowledge of the Vinaya.  He was a pupil of Upatissa and colleague of Mahāsumma (Sp.i.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahāpaduma's opinions are often quoted in the Samantapāsādikā.  i.  184, 283; ii.368, 471; iii.536, 538, 588, 596, 609, 644, 651, 683, 715; iv.819, 827, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when Vasabha's queen was ill, a woman of the court was sent to Mahāpaduma for a remedy, he being evidently skilled in medicine.  The Thera would not prescribe, but explained to his fellow monks what should be done in the case of such an illness.  The remedy was applied in the case of the queen and she recovered.  Later, she visited the Thera, and offered him three robes and a medicine chest containing three hundred kahāpanas; this she placed at his feet, requesting that he should offer flowers in her name.  The Elder accepted the gift and spent the money on offerings of flowers.  Sp.ii.471.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Mahāpaduma.  &lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahānidāna Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifteenth Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, preached to Ananda at Kammāssadamma in the Kuru country.  Ananda says that the doctrine of events as arising from causes is quite clear to him; that it only appears deep.  "Say not so," warns the Buddha, and proceeds to give a detailed exposition of the Paticcasamuppāda, or Chain of Causation, as it comes later to be called, explaining how each link in the chain of samsāra is both the effect of one factor and the cause of another.  The Sutta also discusses the idea of "soul," the seven resting places of cognition (viññānatthiti), the two spheres (āyatana), and the eight kinds of deliverance (vimokkha).  D.ii.55-71; Thomas: cp.  Cit.,197.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khemā had heard the Mahānidāna Sutta in the time of Kassapa Buddha (Ap.ii.546, vs.34).  On hearing it again, preached by Gotama, she revived her memory and became an arahant.  Apii.549, vs.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahāvānija Jātaka (No.  493)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company of merchants once went astray in the forest without food or water, and, seeing a huge banyan-tree with moist branches, they out off a branch and water poured out, from another branch came food, from another a company of girls, and from the fourth various precious things.  Overcome by greed, they wished to cut the tree from its roots in order to get more.  Their leader, the Bodhisatta, tried to prevent this, but they refused to listen.  Then the Nāga king who lived in the tree, ordered his followers to slay all the merchants except the leader.  Him the Nāgas escorted to his home with all the treasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a company of merchants from Sāvatthi, followers of the Buddha, who had a similar experience.  But having moderate desires, they made no attempt to cut down the tree.  Then they returned to Sāvatthi, and, offering some of the precious things to the Buddha, made over the merit thereof to the deity of the tree.  The Buddha praised them for their moderation.  Sāriputta is identified with the Nāga king.  J.iv.350ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Sangharakkhita &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahā Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  He came, with forty thousand others, from Dakkhināgiri vikāra in Ujjeni, to the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.35) and took up his position at the western entrance.

Tissabhūti went to him, on finding his mind corrupted by sinful thoughts, and having received from Sangharakkhita a topic of meditation, he attained to arahantship (AA.i.23f.; MA.i.55).  He was one of the last of the arahants.  J.  L.  Makārakkhira.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;J.iv.490; vi.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

Mahā Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; When over sixty years old and about to die, his companions questioned him on his transcendental attainment.  "I have none," he replied.  A young monk who waited on him said that people had come from twelve yojanas round in the belief that he had attained Nibbāna.  He then asked that he should be raised up and left alone.  As soon as the others left him, he snapped his fingers to show that he had attained arahantship.  He confessed that he had never done anything without mindfulness and understanding.  His nephew also attained arahantship only after fifty years of age.  Vsm.47f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Kotthita (Mahā Kotthika) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of logical analysis (patisambhidappattānam) (A.i.24; Dpv.iv.5; v.  9).  He was born into a very wealthy brahmin family of Sāvatthi, his father being Assalāyana and his mother Candavatī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gained great proficiency in the Vedas and, after hearing the Buddha preach (to his father, says the Apadāna account), entered the Order and, engaging in meditation, soon became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was extremely skilled in knowledge of the Patisambhidā, on which were based all his questions to the Buddha and his own colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a rich householder, and, hearing the Buddha praise a monk as foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā, he wished for similar eminence for himself in the future.  To this end he visited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them for seven days, giving them three robes each at the conclusion of his almsgiving.  Owing to the skill showed by him in the Mahā Veddha Sutta (q.v.), the Buddha declared him foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā (Thag.vs.2; ThagA.i.29ff.; AA.i.159; Ap.ii.479; also Avadānas ii.195).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances are given of discussions between Kotthita and other eminent theras - e.g., the Nalakalāpiya Sutta on kamma (S.ii.112f), the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline (S.iii.165ff), three suttas on samudayadhamma (the nature of arising), two on assāda (satisfaction) (S.iii.172-7), two on samudaya (arising) (S.iii.173) and three on avijjā and vijjā (S.iii.17).  Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects (S.iv.162-5), and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha (avyākatāni).  S.iv.384-91; Mrs.  Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.79i n.1) that all these suttas were compiled rather as "lessons" to be learnt than as genuine inquiries by Kotthita.  The pre eminent monks were "playing" at teacher and pupil in order to aid Kotthita to win proficiency as a teacher.  Another such "lesson" is given at A.iv.382ff., as to the motives guiding those who live the brahmacariya life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these suttas took the form of discussions with Sāriputta, in which Mahā Kotthita is the questioner and Sāriputta the instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One sutta (S.iv.145 7) records a "lesson" given by the Buddha to Kotthita on conceptions of anicca, dukkha and anattā.  The Anguttara Nikāya (see the Kāyasakkhi Sutta, A.i.118f) records a discussion at Jetavana between Savittha, Kotthita and Sāriputta, as to who is best: one who has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by faith.  Another discussion (A.ii.161f) takes place between Sāriputta and Kotthita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact (Nibbāna).  Once there was a dispute between Kotthita and Citta Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Kotthita to abide his time and not interrupt.  Citta's friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Kotthita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order.  And so it happened (A.iii.392ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Kotthita; the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.1006 8; ThagA.ii.117) contains three stanzas in which Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahāpaccarī&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old Commentary on the Tipitaka, used by Buddhaghosa in the compilation of his works.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often referred to in the Samantapāsādika and its comments quoted.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradition has it that it was so called because it was compiled on a raft.&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;E.g., Sp.i.283; iii.527, 536, 553, 615; iv.  763, 770, 776, 778, 782, 803, 806, 807, 813, 861, 914, 923, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Kaccāna, Kaccāyana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha, considered chief among expounders in full of the brief saying of the Buddha, (sankhittena bhāsitassa vitthārena attham vibhajantānam) (A.i.23).  He was born at Ujjenī in the family of the chaplain of King Candappajjota, and was called Kaccāna both because of his golden colour and because Kaccāna was the name of his gotta.  He studied the Vedas, and, on the death of his father, succeeded him as chaplain.  With seven others he visited the Buddha, at the request of Candappajjota, to invite him to come to Ujjenī.  Kaccāna and his friends listened to the Buddha's sermon, and having attained arahantship, joined the order.  He then conveyed the king's invitation to the Buddha, who pointed out that it would now suffice if Kaccāna himself returned to Ujjenī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaccāna accordingly set out for Ujjenī with his seven companions, accepting alms on the way at the house of a very poor girl of Telappanāli, who later became Candappajjota's queen.  For details see Telappanāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Ujjenī, Kaccāna lived in the royal park, where the king showed him all honour.  He preached constantly to the people, and, attracted by his discourses, numerous persons joined the Order, so that the whole city was one blaze of orange robes.  It is said that after having duly established the sāsana in Avantī, Kaccāna returned once more to the Buddha.  (Thus, the explanation of the Madhupindika Sutta was given at Kapilavatthu).  Candappajjota consulted him on various occasions, and among the verses attributed to him in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.494 501), are several addressed to the king himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the time of Padumuttara Buddha that Kaccāna had made his resolve to win the eminence he did, after listening to Padumuttara's praise of a monk, also named Kaccāna, for similar proficiency.  Kaccāna was then a vijjādhara, and offered the Buddha three kanikāra flowers.  So says the Apadāna ii.463, but ThagA.  says he was a vijjādhara in the time of Sumedhā Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a householder of Benares, and offered a golden brick, worth one hundred thousand, to the cetiya which was being built over the Buddha's remains, and then made a vow that in future births his body should be golden (ThagA.i.483f.; AA.i.117f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.465), Kaccāna's father was called Tirītivaccha (or Tidivavaccha), and his mother Candapadumā.  There is another account of Mahā Kaccāna in the Apadāna (A.i.84f), in which it is said that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he built a yandhakuti named Paduma in the shape of a lotus and covered with lotus flowers, and that thirty kappas later he became king under the name of Pabhassara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three suttas are mentioned (AA.i.118) as having obtained for Kaccāna his title of eminence - the Madhupindika, the Kaccāyana and the Parāyana; several instances are given of people seeking Mahā Kaccāna's assistance, for a detailed explanation of something said in brief by the Buddha - e.g., Hāliddikāni, Kālī, Samiddhi, Uttara and Valliya (see also A.iii.314, 321; v.  225; M.iii.223).  Among Kaccāna's pupils and followers and those who consulted him were Sonakutikanna, Isidatta, Avantiputta, Lohicca, Arāmadanda, and Kandarāyana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Avanti, Kaccāna is said to have stayed, not in the king's park, where he lived soon after his return from the Buddha, but chiefly in the Kuraraghara papātā (E.g., S.iii.9; A.v.46; Ud.v.6; Vin.i.194; DhA.iv.101) and in a hut in Makkarakata forest.  S.iv.116; see also VvA.259, according to which he stayed near Potali.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of his staying at Varanā on the bank of Kaddamadaha (A.i.65); at the Gundāvana in Madhurā (A.i.67; M.ii.83); at Tapodā in Rājagaha (A.iii.192), in Soreyya (DhA.i.325; for a curious incident connected with Kaccāna's visit see Soreyya), and in Kosambī (PvA.  140).  According to Dvy.  (551, 585, 586) he also stayed in Roruka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (DhA.ii.176) that even when Kaccāna was living at Avanti, a long distance away, he went regularly to hear the Buddha preach, and when the chief theras took their places in the assembly, they always left room for him.  On one such occasion Sakka showed him great honour, falling at his feet, and the Buddha explained that this was because Mahā Kaccāna kept his senses well guarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.854) records a curious story in reference to Kaccāna.  Vassakāra, minister of Ajātasattu, saw Kaccāna descending Gijjhakūta and said he looked like a monkey.  The Buddha read Vassakāra's thoughts, and warned him that after death he would be born as a monkey in Veluvana.  He believed the Buddha, and made provision in Veluvana for his future comfort as monkey.  And this be did indeed become, living in Veluvana and answering to the name of Vassakāra!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaccāna is identified with the charioteer in the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.181), and with Devala in the Sarabhanga Jātaka (J.v.151).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to tradition, Kaccāna was the author of the Nettippakarana, the Pāli grammar bearing his name, and of the Petakopadesa.  It is probable that these works were the compilations of a school, which traced its descent to Mahā Kaccāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Madhura Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Mahā-Satipatthāna Sutta &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kammāssadamma in the Kuru country.  The Buddha tells the monks that the one and only path leading to Nibbāna is that of the Four Bases of Mindfulness.  These, in brief, are the four ways of directing the mind to the impurities and the impermanency of body: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) kāya, physical structure and activities; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) vedanā, the emotional nature, first as bare feeling, then as having ethical implications; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) citta, conscious life or intelligence, considered under ethical aspects; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) dhamma, considered under the five hindrances; the five groups (khandhas), the six spheres of sense, the seven bojjhangas, and the four Ariyan Truths.  D.ii.290 315.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is considered as one of the most important in the Buddhist Canon.  It has been translated into various languages, and several commentaries on it are in existence.  Its mere recital is said to ward off dangers and to bring happiness, and it is the desire of every Buddhist that he shall die with the Satipatthāna Sutta on his lips, or, at least, with the sound of it in his ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The materials found in the Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta are found also in the Majjhima Nikāya, broken up into two portions, each representing a separate discourse - the Satipatthāna Sutta and the Saccavibhanga Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

One uposatha day the meat which had been prepared for him was eaten by dogs, and the cook, unable to buy any more, cut a piece from a human body recently dead and cooked it.  Brahmadatta had been a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha,Yakkha')"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt; in a former birth and therefore enjoyed the dish.  Having discovered what the meat was, he developed a taste for human flesh, and, in due course, came to having his subjects murdered in order to supply him with food.  His crime was discovered and his guilt brought home by his commander in chief, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalahatthi,Kālahatthī')"&gt;Kālahatthī&lt;/a&gt;, but the king refused to give up his cannibalism and was driven out of the kingdom.  Kālahatthi relates various stories to the king, showing the folly of his behaviour &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- e.g., the story of the fish Ananda, of Sujāta's son, of the geese who lived in Cittakūta and of the Unnābhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;spider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king dwelt in the forests with his cooks, eating all the travelers they were able to seize.  The day arrived when he killed the cook himself and ate his flesh.  Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king.  As he ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain.  Seeing a banyan tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one princes if his foot were healed in seven days.  The foot did heal within that time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means of cords passed through their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context Porisāda) and demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number of his victims.  Sutasoma had been the man eater's friend and private tutor (pitthācariya) at Takkasilā.  Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma's park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa.  On the way to the park, Sutasoma met a brahmin, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha.  Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return from the park, but there he was caught by the Porisāda.  Promising to return to the Porisāda, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda.  This promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Porisāda and went with him to the banyan tree.  There he told the Porisāda of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth.  The Porisāda was greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons.  Sutasoma chose as his first boon that the Porisāda should live for one hundred years; as his second that the captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be restored; and as his fourth that the Porisāda should give up his cannibalism.  Only very reluctantly did the Porisāda agree to the fourth.  Sutasoma then took him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits.  Sutasoma then returned to Indapatta.  In gratitude for the tree sprite's intervention, a lake was dug near the banyan tree and a village founded near by, whose inhabitants were required to make offerings to the tree.  This village, built on the spot where the Porisāda was converted, came to be called Kammāsadamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's conversion of Angulimāla, with whom the man eater is identified.  Kālahatthi was Sāriputta, Nanda was Ananda, the tree sprite was Kassapa, Sakka was Anuruddha, and Sutasoma the Bodhisatta.  J.v.456 511; cp.  Jātakamāla xxxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutasomacariyā is given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Mahā Abhaya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahā Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt; See Abhaya-giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mahā Abhaya-Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually called Dighabhānaka Abhaya.  He was evidently an eminent Thera.  It is said (Sp.ii.474f.; referred to at DhSA.399) that when news arrived that the brigand Abhaya was coming to Cetiyagiri to pillage it, the patrons of the vihāra informed Abhaya Thera of this.  He asked them to collect various kinds of food and drink wherewith to entertain the brigand.  The latter was greatly pleased, and, on learning that this hospitality was shown him at the instigation of Abhaya Thera, he visited the Elder and took upon himself the protection of the vihāra from all danger.  Later the monks questioned the right of the Elder to entertain a robber with what belonged to the vihāra, but he convened an assembly of the monks and convinced them that he was guiltless, as his act had been solely for the protection of the belongings of the Sangha.  This story shows that the Elder lived at Cetiyagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion (MA.i.65f) Abhaya Thera preached the Mahā Ariyavamsa patipadā, and the whole village (? Mahāgāma) came to hear him.  After the sermon he received great honour.  An elderly monk was full of envy and abused him, saying that under guise of preaching he had filled the night with noise.  The two monks had to travel along the same road for the distance of a gāvuta, and all the way the old monk abused Abhaya.  When their roads separated, Abhaya worshipped the monk and took leave of him and said, when asked later, that he had heard none of the abuse because he had been all the time engaged in meditation.  One day, a certain woman who had come all the way from Ullabha kolakannikā, a distance of five leagues, to hear Abhaya preach the Ariyavamsa, found that he was about to arise without finishing the sermon, and reminded him that he was omitting the most important part.  The monk praised her and continued to preach till dawn, when the woman became a sotāpanna (AA.i.386).  It is said that once Abhaya wanted to know if a certain pindapātika monk were a putthujjana or not.  While this monk was bathing at the mouth of the Kalyānī River, Abhaya told a novice to dive into the water and catch hold of his foot.  The monk, thinking it was a crocodile, screamed with fear, and Abhaya knew that he was a puthujjana (MA.ii.869).  Thieves once bound an Elder with creepers and made him lie down.  A jungle fire spread to him, but before the creepers could be cut, he established insight and died an arahant.  Abhaya, coming along with five hundred others, saw the body, cremated it, and had a shrine built over the remains (Vsm.36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhaya's opinion was evidently greatly respected, and he is mentioned as having been consulted by Maha Dhammarakhita (VibhA.81) and Mallaka (Vsm.266) on problems connected with the Abhidhamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhaya is mentioned among those who could remember very early incidents in their lives.  When he was only nine days old, his mother bent down to embrace him, but her hair became loose and the sumana-flowers she wore on her head fell on him, hurting him.  In later life he could remember this incident.  DA.ii.530; MNidA.234.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Mahā-Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-A monk of Uddalokaka Vihāra.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahā Moggallāna Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of the Chief Disciples of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  He was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kolitagaama,Kolitagāma')"&gt;Kolitagāma&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, on the same day as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (they were both older than the Buddha), and was called Kolita after his village.  His mother was a brahminee called Moggalī (Moggallāni), and his father was the chief, householder of the village.  Moggallāna's and Sāriputta's families had maintained an unbroken friendship for seven generations, and so the children were friends from their childhood.  Sāriputta had five hundred golden palanquins and Moggallāna five hundred carriages drawn by thoroughbreds.  One day the two friends went together to see a mime play (giraggasamajjā), and there, realizing the impermanence of things, decided to renounce the world.  They first lived as disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjaya,Sañjaya')"&gt;Sañjaya&lt;/a&gt;, and then wandered all over &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;, discussing with all learned men, but finding no satisfaction.  Then they separated, after agreeing that whoever first succeeded in finding what they sought should inform the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some time, Sāriputta, wandering about in Rājagaha, met &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji,Assaji')"&gt;Assaji&lt;/a&gt;, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;.  He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaji,Assaji')"&gt;Assaji&lt;/a&gt; (ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, etc.), and Moggallāna also became a sotāpanna.  The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them.  Sañjaya's disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veluvana.  The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by the "ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā." All became arahants except Sāriputta and Moggallāna.  Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla (for details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called Kallavālamutta) in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating.  The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous.  That very day he attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were ordained, the Buddha announced in the assembly of monks that he had assigned to them the place of Chief Disciples and then recited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha,Pātimokkha')"&gt;Pātimokkha&lt;/a&gt;.  The monks were offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour.  But the Buddha told them how these two had for a whole asankheyya and one hundred thousand years strenuously exerted themselves to win this great eminence under him.  They had made the first resolve in the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anomadassii,Anomadassī')"&gt;Anomadassī&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.  Moggallāna had been a householder, named Sirivaddha, and Sāriputta a householder, called Sarada.  Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic.  The Buddha visited him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed him great honour.  Anomadassī's chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha.  Anomadassī saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, and, announcing the Buddha's prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place of second disciple.  Acting on this advice, Sirivaddha made elaborate preparations and entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days.  At the end of that time, he announced his wish to the Buddha, who declared that it would be fulfilled.  From that time, the two friends, in that and subsequent births, engaged in good deeds.  AA.i.84ff.; Ap.ii.31ff.; DhA.i.73f.; SNA.i.326ff.; the story of the present is given in brief at Vin.i.39ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow (E.g., S.ii.235; A.i.88).  In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccavibhanga_sutta,Saccavibhanga Sutta')"&gt;Saccavibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these "twin brethren" from the others: "Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.  Sāriputta is able to teach and make plain the four Noble Truths; Moggallāna, on the other hand, teaches by his &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paatihariya,iddhi-pātihāriya')"&gt;iddhi-pātihāriya&lt;/a&gt;." (BuA.31) Moggallāna's pre eminence lay in his possession of iddhi power (A.i.23).  He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will.  Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as saying that he could crush &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sineru,Sineru')"&gt;Sineru&lt;/a&gt; like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potter's wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand.  When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veranjaa,Verañjā')"&gt;Verañjā&lt;/a&gt;, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food.  He also offered to open a way from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda,Nalerupu')"&gt;Nalerupu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nalerupucimanda,-cimanda')"&gt;-cimanda&lt;/a&gt;to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarakuru,Uttarakuru')"&gt;Uttarakuru&lt;/a&gt;, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha (Vin.iii.7; Sp.i.182f.; DhA.ii.153).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several instances are given of this special display of iddhi.  Once, at the Buddha's request, with his great toe he shook the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada,Migāramātupāsāda')"&gt;Migāramātupāsāda&lt;/a&gt;, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey.  See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasadakampana,Pasādakampana Sutta')"&gt;Pasādakampana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, S.v.269ff.; also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/utthaana_s,Utthāna Sutta')"&gt;Utthāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, SNA.i.336f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; to find out if he had profited by the Buddha's teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour.  He thereupon shook Sakka's palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka's hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled (See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_tanhaasankhaya_s,Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta')"&gt;Cūlatanhāsankhaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, M.i.251ff).  Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā.  He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhammā-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous.  Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f.  ; other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā (A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp.  Mtu.i.54ff.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kālī was the mother of the present Māra.  Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), Moggallāna's greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the Nāga Nandopananda.  No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jhāna; which was the reason why the Buddha would give permission to no other monk but Moggallāna to quell the Nāga's pride.  Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the Nāga who lived near the hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.).  Moggallāna could see, without entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp.  Avadānas i.246ff.).  He would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff.  regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the Buddha used in illustration of his sermons.  The Vimānavatthu (see also DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that Moggallāna's visits to the deva worlds- e.g., that to Tāvatimsa were very welcome to the devas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Moggallāna's pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet in wisdom, too, he was second only to Sāriputta.  These two could answer questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227).  The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna's powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary.  And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them.  At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff).  Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jhānas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach.  Other devas also went to hear him - e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv.  269 80).  He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa (A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha.  When the Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa, it was to Moggallāna that he entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return.  Moggallāna, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while Anāthapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219).  When the time drew near for the Buddha's return, Moggallāna, at the request of the people, went to Tāvatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp.  Dvy.375).  No task, which he might be told by the Buddha to perform, seemed to Moggallāna too insignificant.  Thus we find him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62).  He was also sent to Sakkhara, to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., i.369f.; J.i.347); and to Sīlavā, whom Ajātasattu was plotting to kill (ThagA.i.536).  When Visakhā was building the Migāramātupāsāda and the Buddha was away on one of his journeys, Moggallāna, because of his iddhi power, and five hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without difficulty (DhA.i.414f).  The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure.  There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door (A.iv.204ff.).  Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ananda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself (Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them - e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p.  231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff).  When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back.  They were successful in this mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish the Assajipunabbasukā).  Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta's intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff).  When Rāhula, the Buddha's son, was ordained, Sāriputta was his preceptor and Moggallāna his teacher (J.i.161; see SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different.  There Moggallāna is spoken of as Rāhula's kammavācāriya.).  Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks' welfare.  Among the verses, attributed to him in the Theragāthā, are several containing exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f ); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name - e.g., Tissa, Vaddhamāna and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f).  Elsewhere (S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at Kālasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants.  Vangīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration.  Sāriputta's verses in praise of Moggallāna (Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta (Thag.vss.1176).  Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye.  E.g., S.ii.275ff.; Moggallāna elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers.  For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see A.ii.154f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in the Gosingasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ananda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion.  Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned (S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa.  Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipatthānas (S.v.294f).  It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations.  Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri (A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in Macchikāsanda (DhA.ii.74f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna died before the Buddha, Sāriputta dying before either.  The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta's death (vs.1158 61).  Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika and Moggallāna two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the Niganthas.  Moggallāna used to visit various worlds and return with his report that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddha's teaching reached happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful conditions.  These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they bribed brigands to kill Moggallāna.  They surrounded the Elder's cell in Kālasilā, but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole.  On six successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, crushing his bones and leaving him for dead.  Having recovered consciousness, with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds.  This sad death is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth.  Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them to death.  For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his last birth lost his life by violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account in DhA.iii.65ff.  differs in several details.  The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to the supposed thieves to spare their son.  Moggallāna, very touched by this, did not kill them.  Before passing into Nibbāna, he preached to the Buddha, at his request, and performed many miracles, returning to Kālasilā to die.  According to the Jātaka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha had the relics collected and a Thūpa erected in Veluvana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna's body was of the colour of the blue lotus or the rain cloud (Bu.i.58).  There exists in Ceylon an oral tradition that this colour is due to his having suffered in hell in the recent past!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna is connected with characters in several Jātakas: thus, he was &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kisavaccha in the Indriya Jātaka (J.iii.469), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sakka in the Illīsa (i.  354), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one of the devas in the Kakkāru (iii.90), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tortoise in the Kurungamiga (ii.155), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Candasena in the Khandahāla (vi.  157), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the senāpati in the Cullasutasoma (v.  192), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the youngest bird in the Javanahamsa (iv.  218), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the elephant in the Tittira (i.  220), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Tittira (iii.543), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ayura in the Dasannaka (iii.341), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the jackal in the Pañcūposatha (iv.  332), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suriya in the Bilārikosiya (iv.  69), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one of the brothers in the Bhisa (iv.  314), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subhaga in the Bhūridatta (vi.  219), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the old tortoise in the Mahāukkusa (iv.  297), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migājina in the Mahājanaka (vi.  68), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bījaka in the Mahānāradakassapa (vi.  255), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the king's charioteer in the Rājovāda (ii.5), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Vannāroha (iii.193), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Garula king in the Vidhurapandita (vi.  329), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the tiger in the Vyaggha (ii.358), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the rat in the Saccankara (i.  32), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bhadrakāra in the Sambhava (v.  67), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kisavaccha in the Sambhanga (v.  151), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the jackal in the Sasa (iii.56), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canda in the Sudhābhojana (v.  412), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gopāla in the Hatthipāla (iv.  491).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka (No.  544)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angati,Angati')"&gt;Angati&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa,Mithilā')"&gt;Mithilā&lt;/a&gt; in Videha, is a good ruler.  One full moon night he consults his ministers as to how they shall amuse themselves.  Alāta suggests new conquests; Sunāma suggests that they shall seek pleasure in dance, song and music; but Vijaya recommends that they shall visit some samana or brahmin.  Angati falls in with the views of Vijaya, and in great state goes to Guna of the Kassapagotta, an ascetic who lives in the park near the city.  Guna preaches to him that there is no fruit, good or evil, in the moral life; there is no other world than this, no strength, no courage; all beings are predestined and follow their course like the ship her stern.  Alāta approves of the views of Guna; he remembers how, in his past life, he was a wicked councillor called Pingala; from there he was born in the family of a general, and now he is a minister.  A slave, Bījaka, who is present, can remember his past life and says he was once Bhavasetthi in Sāketa, virtuous and generous, but he is now the son of a prostitute.  Even now he gives away half his food to any in need, but see how destitute he is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angati is convinced that Ginda's doctrine is correct, and resolves to find delight only in pleasure.  He gives orders that he shall not be disturbed in his palace; Candaka, his minister, is deputed to look after the kingdom.  Fourteen days pass in this manner.  Then the king's only child, his beloved daughter Rujā, comes to him arrayed in splendour, attended by her maidens, and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants.  Angati protests; he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury, but has learnt too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in keeping the fasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rujā is at first amazed, then tells her father that his councillors are fools, they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past, but remember only one birth or two; they cannot therefore judge.  She herself remembers several births; in one she was a smith in Rājagaha and committed adultery, but that sin remained hidden, like fire covered with ashes, and she was born as a rich merchant's only son in Kosambī.  There she engaged in good works, but, because of previous deeds, she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya and then as a castrated goat in Bhennākata.  In her next birth she was a monkey, and then an ox among the Dasannas; then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians, and later a nymph in Tāvatimsa.  Once more her good deeds have come round, and hereafter she will be born only among gods and men.  Seven births hence she will be a male god in Tāvatimsa, and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All night she preaches in this way to her father, but he remains unconvinced.  The Bodhisatta is a Brahmā, named Nārada Kassapa, and, surveying the world, sees Rujā and Angati engaged in conversation.  He therefore appears in the guise of an ascetic, and Angati goes out to greet and consult him.  The ascetic praises goodness, charity, and generosity, and speaks of other worlds.  Angati laughs, and asks for a loan which, he says, he will repay twice over in the next world, as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one.  Nārada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn unless he mends his ways, and mentions to him the names of former kings who attained to happiness through good lives.  The king at last sees his error and determines to choose new friends.  Nārada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves in all majesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the conversion of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela Kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;.  He came, after his conversion, with the Buddha to Latthivana, and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha.  He dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had earlier practised, and, laying his head on the Buddha's feet did obeisance.  Then he rose seven times into the air, and, after having worshipped the Buddha, sat on one side.  The people marvelled at the Buddha's powers of conversion, which, the Buddha said, were not surprising since he possessed them already as a Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa, Alāta with Devadatta, Sunāma with Bhaddiya, Vijaya with Sāriputta, Bījaka with Moggallāna, Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta, and Rujā with Ananda.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dasārahā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of Khattiyas, owners of the Anaka-drum (q.v.) (S.ii.266f).  Buddhaghosa says (SA.ii.167) they were so called because they took one tenth of the corn (sassato dasabhāgam ganhimsu, tasmā Dasārahā ti paññāyimsu).

It seems to have been designed as a supplement to the Dhammasangani, and discusses, chiefly, the mental characteristics found in converted and earnest persons.  It is divided into fourteen sections and possesses a Commentary by Buddhaghosa.  Published by the P.T.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sarvāstvādins call the Dhātukathā the Dhātukāyapada.

Other animals, alarmed by the sight, ran also until all the beasts of the forest were in headlong flight.  The Bodhisatta, born as a lion, heard their story and calmed their fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a question asked of the Buddha by some monks, as to various austerities practised by ascetics.

The Buddha points out to him the need for consistency in outlook and expounds to him his own doctrine.  Sāriputta is present, fanning the Buddha.  At the end of the discourse, Sāriputta becomes an arahant and Dīghanakha a sotāpanna (M.i.497ff).  Elsewhere the sutta is called Vedanāpariggaha.

The Bodhisatta appeared before him and threatened to crush his forces, and the Gandhāra king fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to an ascetic who visited Jetavana in order to argue with the Buddha; but on seeing the Buddha seated in the hall expounding the Doctrine, his courage forsook him and he ran away with a crowd at his heels.

It is based on an older Sinhalese Chronicle, the Daladāvamsa, and is an elaborate work dealing with the history of the Tooth Relic up to the time of its arrival in Ceylon.  Ed.  by the P.T.S.  (1884); for details see P.L.C.207f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Devadaha (Vagga/Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devadaha.&lt;/b&gt;-A township (nigama) of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya,Sākiyans')"&gt;Sākiyans&lt;/a&gt;.  The Buddha stayed there during his tours and preached to the monks on various topics (S.iii.5f; iv.124f; M.ii.214).  According to the Commentaries (J.i.52; BuA.226; MA.ii.924, 1021, etc; ThigA.182) it was the city of the birth of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa,Buddha`s mother')"&gt;Buddha's mother&lt;/a&gt; and of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Pajāpatī Gotamī')"&gt;Pajāpatī Gotamī&lt;/a&gt; and of their companions, who married the Sākiyans of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lumbini,Lumbinīvana')"&gt;Lumbinīvana&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha was born, was near Devadaha.  The name was originally that of a lake, so called either because kings held their sports in it (devā vuccanti rājāno tesam mangaladaho), or because it came into existence without human intervention, hence divine (sayañjāto vā so daho, tasmā pi Devadaho).  The name was later transferred to the village near by.  SA.ii.186; also MA.ii.810. Acc.  to the Dulva (Rockhill, p.12), the city was founded by Sākiyans from Kapilavatthu, when they grew very numerous.  The spot was pointed out by a deva, hence its name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; of Devadaha was a contemporary of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suddhodana,Suddhodana')"&gt;Suddhodana&lt;/a&gt; (p.14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadaha was the residence of Devadaha Sakka (Mhv.ii.17; MT.87) and of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pakkha_thera,Pakkha Thera')"&gt;Pakkha Thera&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devadaha&lt;/b&gt;.-A Sākiyan chief called &lt;b&gt;Devadaha-Sakka&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His children were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana,Añjana')"&gt;Añjana&lt;/a&gt; and Kaccānā.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahamaayaa,Māyā')"&gt;Māyā&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Pajāpatī')"&gt;Pajāpatī&lt;/a&gt;, respectively mother and step-mother of the Buddha, were daughters of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana,Añjana')"&gt;Añjana&lt;/a&gt;.  Mhv.ii.17; MT.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devadaha Vagga&lt;/b&gt;.-The eleventh section of the Majjhima Nikāya (suttas 101-10), the Devadaha Sutta being its first sutta.  M.ii.214ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devadaha Vagga&lt;/b&gt;.-The fourteenth chapter of the Salāyatana Samyutta.  S.iv.124ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devadaha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached to the monks at Lumbinīvana (MA.ii.810), in Devadaha.  It deals with the teaching of the Niganthas, that whatsoever the individual experience, it comes from former actions.  The sutta also gives ten beliefs of the Niganthas, which, the Buddha says, are to be condemned.  In contrast to these, ten statements are made respecting the Tathāgata, which are intrinsically true.  M.ii.214ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devadaha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached to the monks at Devadaha.  Some monks, going to reside in the western districts, come to the Buddha to take leave of him.  He advises them, before starting, to visit Sāriputta, whom he extols.  This they do, and Sāriputta explains to them the fundamental teachings of the Buddha, in order that they may be ready to answer any questions which may be put to them.  S.iii.6ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dabbapuppha Jātaka (No.400)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was once a jackal called Māyāvī.  His wife had a longing to eat fresh fish, and while he was searching for it he saw two otters, Anutīracārī and Gambhīracārī, disputing as to the division of a rohita fish which they had caught between them.  They appealed to Māyāvī to arbitrate, and he gave one the head, the other the tail, while he kept the middle portion for himself!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Upananda, who is identified with the jackal.  Two old monks had received as a gift two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket, and they appealed to him to divide the gifts.  He gave them each a cloak and kept the blanket for himself.  J.iii.332ff; the story is quoted at DhA.iii.139ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dona&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dona.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin.  He was at Kusinārā at the time of the Buddha's death, and it was his intervention which prevented a quarrel among the kings who assembled there to claim the Buddha's relics.  He pointed out to them the impropriety of a quarrel over anything connected with the Buddha, the teacher of Peace.  The claimants thereupon asked Dona to undertake the distribution of the relics.  He divided them into eight parts, one of which he gave to each king.  He himself kept the vessel used for collecting and dividing the relics, and over it he built a thūpa, celebrating a feast in its honour (D.ii.166f; Bu.xxviii.4; UdA.402).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dona first met the Buddha on the road between Ukkatthā and Setavyā.  He saw the Buddha's footprints and, following them, he came upon the Buddha seated at the foot of a-tree.  Dona asked him various questions as to his identity and the Buddha explained to him his Buddha-hood (A.ii.37f).  The Commentary (AA.ii.505f) states that Dona was a teacher with a large following, and that the Buddha's journey to Setavyā was undertaken for the purpose of meeting him.  At the end of the Buddha's discourse, Dona became an anāgāmī and composed a poem of twelve thousand words in praise of the Buddha.  This poem became known as the Donagajjita.  Dona was held in very high esteem as a teacher, and it is said (DA.ii.607f) that, at some time or other practically all the chiefs of Jambudīpa had sat at his feet.  Therefore he was able to dissuade them from quarrelling over the Buddha's relics.  On that occasion he stood on a hill and recited the Donagajjita.  At first his voice could not be heard through the uproar, but, by degrees, they recognised his voice and listened with wrapt attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the distribution of the relics, Dona, watching his opportunity, hid, in his turban, the right eye-tooth of the Buddha, but Sakka saw this, and thinking that Dona was incapable of rendering suitable honour to this relic, removed it and placed it in the Cūlāmani-cetiya (DA.ii.609).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dona.&lt;/b&gt;-A Nāga king.  See Mahādona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dona.&lt;/b&gt;-A bathing place in Jambudīpa, where sacrifice was offered to the gods.  J.v.388f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Dona&lt;/b&gt;.-A Tamil stronghold captured by Dutthagāmanī.  It was commanded by Gavara.  Mhv.xxv.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dussīlya &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dussīlya or Anāthapindika Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Anāthapindika, grievously ill, sends for Sāriputta, who visits him with Ananda.  Sāriputta reminds Anāthapindika of his virtuous qualities, such as his loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, his freedom from immorality and the like, from wrong views, aims, etc.  Immediately Anāthapindika's pains vanish, he serves the two monks from his own cooking-pot, and they take their leave.  Amanda reports the incident to the Buddha, who praises Sāriputta's wisdom.  S.v.380ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dussīlya or Anāthapindika Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The same as the first, but here it is Ananda who admonishes and reminds Anāthapindika that he possesses all the qualities of a sotāpanna.  S.v.385f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dīpi Jātaka (No.426)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goatherds once occupied an ascetic's hut, and, on their departure, left behind a she-goat who had strayed away.  As she ran to join the others, she saw a panther in the way; she showed great daring and tried to pacify him with soft words, but all in vain, for he devoured her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a she-goat whom Moggallāna once saw near his mountain hut.  When she, however, saw a panther, she, with great daring, jumped over his body and escaped.  J.iii.479f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhītā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr color="#808080"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhītā Sutta.-Pasenadi visits the Buddha and grumbles because Mallikā has given birth to a daughter.  The Buddha points out to him that a woman may prove a better offspring than a male.  S.i.86. (de S.3.16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhītā Sutta.-Incalculable is samsāra, and it is impossible to find one who, in his wanderings, has not lost a daughter.  S.ii.190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasava-pitā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father of Dhammasava.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one hundred and twenty years old when his son joined the Order and, being impressed by his son's renunciation while yet young, he followed his example and soon after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, in the past, he saw a Pacceka Buddha on the Bhūtagana mountain, and honoured him with tinasūla-flowers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven kappas ago he was a king called Dharanīpati (Dharaniruha) (Thag.108; ThagA.i.215f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Tinasūlaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.179.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Devamantiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the nobles of King Milinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He it was who took the king to Nāgasena and who was asked to invite Nāgasena to the palace (Mil.22f.29).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name is considered to be a corruption of the Greek Demetrius (Mil.  Trans.vol.i.p.xix, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Devā (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devā&lt;/b&gt;.-A class of beings.  As a title the word Deva is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as being above the human level.  Thus it is used for a king.  In a late classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devil: sammutidevā (conventional gods - e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidevā (beings who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit - arahants and Buddhas); and uppattidevā (beings who are born divine).  Under the third category various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven: Cātummahārājikā, Tāvatimsā, Yāmā, Tusitā, Nimmānaratī, Paranimmitavasavattī and Brahmakāyikā (E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.).  The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nikāya (i.289; iii.100. The Divyāvadāna p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which contains the names of twenty-five groups.  The popular etymology of the word connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbantī ti devā, pañcahi kāmagunehi kīlanti, attano vā siriyā jotantī ti attho (KhA.123).  The word implies possession of splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction - such as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas.  The Devas are generally regarded as sharing kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devas have been men and may again be born among men.  They take interest in the doings of men, especially the Cātummahārājikā and the gods of Tāvatimsa.  They come to earth to worship the Buddha and to show reverence to good men.  Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as chief of the gods - devānam indo.  All Devas are themselves in samsāra, needing salvation.  They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the merit of each individual deva.  They are born in the full flower of youth and are free from illness till the moment of their death.  Devas die from one of the following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to anger.  (DhA.l.173. For other particulars regarding devas see the article in the NPD).  When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him: his clothes get soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses its colour and he becomes restless on his seat.  DA.ii.427f; DhSA, 33, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devā.&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Udaya I.  and wife of Mahinda, son of the Ādipāda Dāthāsiva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cv.xlix.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Devā.&lt;/b&gt;-Daughter of Dappula II.  and wife of Kittaggabodhi.  Cv.xlix.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Devā&lt;/b&gt;.-Wife of Kassapa V.  and mother of Sakkasenāpati.  She built, for the monks living in the wilderness, a vihāra called after herself, and adorned the Buddha-image at Maricavatti.  Cv.lii.52, 61, 64ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devā or Vatapada Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The seven rules of conduct observed by Sakka, whereby he obtained celestial sovereignty.  S.i.227.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Explains the various names of Sakka-Magha, Purindada, Vāsava, Sahassakkha, Sujampati and Devānam-inda.  S.i.228.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Devā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Mahāli visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and asks if he has seen Sakka.  The Buddha answers that he has and that he knows many things about Sakka.  He then repeats what is given in Nos.1 and 2 above.  S.i.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Damilathūpa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cetiya erected at Pulatthipura by Parakkamabāhu I.  Its original name was the Mahā Thūpa, but it was renamed on account of its being built by the Damilas brought as captives from the Damila kingdom.  Its circumference of one thousand three hundred cubits was larger than that of all other thūpas and, according to the Chronicle, it was built without the aid of any miraculous power.  Cv.lxxviii.76ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammaceti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Pegu (A.C.1460-91); a very enlightened monarch.  He was first a monk; he then gave up his robes and became first the minister and later the son-in-law and successor of Queen Shin-san-bu.  He sent a mission to Ceylon, where a body of Rāmañña monks were ordained at the Kalyāni-sīmā.  These returned to Rāmañña and were known as the Sīhalasangha.  For details see Bode: op.  cit., 38f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasangani&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first book, in the accepted order of precedence, of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.  It deals with more or less the same topics as the Nikāyas, differing only in methods of treatment; the chief subject is that of ethics, the enquiry thereinto being conducted from a psychological standpoint.  The book enumerates and defines a number of categories of terms occurring in the Nikāyas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is in existence a commentary on the book, written by Buddhaghosa and called the Atthasālinī.  King Vijayabāhu I, of Ceylon translated the Dhammasangani into Sinhalese (Cv.lx.17), but this translation is now lost.  The work has been translated into English.  The text is published by the P.T.S.  (1885), and the translation (by Mrs.  Rhys Davids) is published by the R.A.S., under the title of A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammasangani appears to have been also called Dhammasangaha (DA.i.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dutiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dutiya Sutta.-On the four modes of progress: painful with sluggish intuition and with swift intuition, and pleasant, with the same two varieties of intuition.  A.ii.154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dutiya Sutta.-Questions asked by a deva and the Buddha's reply thereto.  "What has a good man as his companion?" is one question, and the reply thereto is "faith." (S.i.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Devadatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the Sākiyan Suppabuddha (maternal uncle of the Buddha) and his wife Amitā.  He had a sister Bhaddakaccānā, who married Prince Siddhattha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mhv.ii.22; MT.136; DhA.iii.44. The Dulva (Rockhill, p.13) calls him the son of Amitodana and brother of Ananda.  This is supported by Mtu.  (ii.69), which says that after the Buddha's renunciation, Devadatta tried to tempt Bhaddakaccānā.  In one passage in the Vinaya (ii.189), Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta.  Does this mean that his mother's name was Godhī? The Sanskrit books (e.g., Mtu) give several stories of his youth which show his malice.  When Siddhattha was about to show his skill in the arts, a white elephant was being brought for him, and Devadatta, out of envy, killed it.  The carcase blocked the city gates till Siddhattha threw it outside.  The Pāli Commentaries (e.g., SA.i.62) say that Devadatta had the strength of five elephants.  On another occasion he quarrelled with Siddhattha, who protested against his shooting a goose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiyā and entered the Order (Vin.ii.182).  During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world (puthujja-nika-iddhi) (Vin.ii.183; for particulars see Rockhill, p.85).  For some time he seems to have enjoyed great honour in the Order, and in one passage he is mentioned in a list of eleven of the chief Elders of all of whom the Buddha speaks in praise.  (Ud.i.5. Again in Vin.ii.189 Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta's praises; see also DhA.i.64f).  Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes (E.g., S.ii.156).  About eight years before the Buddha's death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha's fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following account is summarised from various passages in the books, chiefly Vin.ii.184ff; iii.171f; 174f; iv.71; DhA.i.112ff; iii.154; A.iii.123, 402; ii.73; iv.160; J.i.113, 142, 185, 490; iv.37, 158; v.333ff; vi.129f., etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu's lap, frightening him.  He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.  (According to J.i.186, 508, Ajātasattu built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and sent him, daily, five hundred pots of three-year-flavoured rice and the choicest dishes.  These meals were so tempting that some of the Buddha's followers would go there to eat them and return stealthily).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This encouraged Devadatta in his schemes, and he conceived the idea of taking the Buddha's place as leader of the Sangha.  As soon as this thought occurred to him, his iddhi-power disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Koliyan Kakudha, follower of Moggallāna, reborn as a manomaya-kāyikadeva, divined Devadatta's plan and informed Moggallāna.  The latter repeated the matter to the Buddha, but the Buddha said it was unnecessary to discuss it as Devadatta would ultimately betray himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha's approaching old age.  The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, "Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?" (Vin.ii.188. This incident is referred to in the Abhayarājakumāra Sutta, M.i.393).  Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance.  Thereupon, at the Buddha's suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Sangha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha.  (The Ap.ii.300f explains that all these plans of Devadatta to harm the Buddha were the result of the Buddha's previous evil deeds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha.  These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale.  But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha's majesty, and his body became stiff.  The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime.  The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path.  The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other.  The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and he preached to them and converted them.  The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself.  One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūta, he hurled down on him a great rock.  Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha's foot, causing the blood to flow.  Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka's Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him.  After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta's next attempt on the Buddha's life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass.  The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back.  As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased.  (Sp.iv.811. At this time, Kokālika was very useful to Devadatta, J.  ii.438).  Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khandadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order.  These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Sangha: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules - except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season - but he refused to make the rules obligatory.  This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance.  He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha's warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Amanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa.  On this occasion he tried to imitate the Buddha, keeping two chief disciples beside him (DhA.i.122).  Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the followers of Devadatta were also some nuns, chief of whom was Thullanandā, who never tired of singing his praises (Vin.iv.66, 335).  The mother of Kumārakassapa (q.v.), also, first entered the Order under Devadatta, but when he denounced her, following the discovery of her pregnancy, she sought refuge with the Buddha.  Some of the Sākiyans, too, seem to have preferred Devadatta to the Buddha - e.g., Dandapāni (MA.i.298).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones.  Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika's warning, welcomed them.  That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly.  Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them.  Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news.  When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.  (The Vinaya account omits the kicking, but it is mentioned in DhA.i.143 and in J.i.491).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life.  Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash.  The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci, where, after suffering for one hundred thousand kappas, he would be reborn as a Pacceka Buddha called Atthissara.  (The Saddharmapundarika (chap.xi.) says he will be a Buddha named Devarāja).  It is said (DhA.i.147; see also Mil.108) that at the moment of being swallowed by the earth, Devadatta uttered a stanza in which he declared that he had no refuge other than the Buddha.  It is this last act of Devadatta's which the Buddha had in view when he agreed to ordain Devadatta.  (He was one of five people who were swallowed by the earth in the Buddha's time.  Mil.101).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary contains a graphic account of the tortures of Devadatta in Avīci.  (DhA.i.147; also PSA.79. His body in bell is one hundred leagues long).  In previous births, also, he had been swallowed by the earth, as King Kalābu and as Mahāpatāpa.  When the people heard of Devadatta's death, they held a great festival, as they had done of yore at the death of Pingala, who was an incarnation of Devadatta (DhA.i.126f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka Commentary contains numerous stories showing that Devadatta's enmity towards the Buddha was not confined to this life.  It had existed during many kappas, and though sometimes he was foiled in his attempts to harm the Bodhisatta, in many cases he succeeded in working his will.  The beginning of this enmity, which increased with time, is described in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/serivanija_jat_003,Serivānija Jātaka')"&gt;Serivānija Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Milinda dilemmas (200ff) is as follows: "Why should Devadatta, who was so wicked, have been, time after time, superior in power to the Bodhisatta?" A list of such instances is given.  Nāgasena's reply is that Devadatta did several good deeds, such as protecting the poor, building bridges, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta's wickedness and his hatred of the Bodhisatta are illustrated in various Jātakas besides those already mentioned - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)"

In several stories his craftiness is emphasised - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as the jackal in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sigala_jat_113_142_8,Sigālā Jātaka')"&gt;Sigālā Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as the drunken sot in the Sigāla (No.2) and also in the Manoja.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Kālabāhu Jātaka he is represented as very envious, and his falsehood and duplicity are emphasised in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Cetiya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Kakkāra and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Somanassa Jātakas.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ingratitude is illustrated in such stories as those of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Anta, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Amba, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Asampadāna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Upāhana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Guttila, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Javasakuna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Dūbhiya-makkata, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Nigrodha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Mahākapi, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Ruru and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Sīlavanāga Jātakas,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;while others, such as &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Apannaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Ubhatobhattha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Kandagalaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Kāsāva, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Giridanta, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Jambuka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Jambukhādaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Parantapa, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Lakkhana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Vinīlaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Virocana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Vīraka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Sabbadātha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Sammuddavānija, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Sammodamāna Jātakas, speak of his folly and inefficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is stated (E.g., Mil.410) that in spite of the great hatred shown by Devadatta towards him, the Buddha did not harbour, on his part, one single feeling of ill-will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only once is mention made (A.iv.402f ) of the text of a sermon by Devadatta.  Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dasaratha Jātaka (No.461)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasaratha, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, had three children, Rāmapandita, Lakkhana and Sītā.  On the death of his queen he took another queen and had by her a son, Bharata.  When Bharata was seven years old his mother claimed the kingdom for him in accordance with a boon granted her by the king.  The king was horrified and fearing that she would harm his elder children, sent them into the forest for twelve years, asking them to return after his death.  In the forest Rāma lived the ascetic life while Lakkhana and Sītā provided him with food.  Dasaratha died after nine years, and when the ministers refused to recognise Bharata as king, he went into the forest in search of Rāma.  Rāma, however, refused to return until three more years had elapsed, and on Bharata refusing to occupy the throne, Rāma gave him his straw slippers to be placed on the throne in his absence.  When cases were heard, if the decision given was wrong, the slippers would beat upon each other, but, if right, they would lie quiet.  After three years Rāma returned and reigned from his palace of Sucandaka for sixteen thousand years, with Sītā as queen consort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasaratha was Suddhodana, Bharata Ananda, Lakkhana Sāriputta, Sītā Rāhulamātā and Rāma the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a man of Sāvatthi who greatly grieved at his father's death and neglected all his duties.

Devadatta Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached to the monks at Gijjhakūta soon after Devadatta left the Order.  Love of gain, favours and flattery came upon Devadatta for his undoing, like fruit to a plaintain or a bamboo tree, etc.  A.ii.73; see No.3 below; cp.  Vin.ii.187f and S.ii.242.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devadatta Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Preached in the same circumstances as the above.  It gives eight reasons for Devadatta's downfall, and urges upon the monks the necessity for reflection on the good and bad fortune which overtake oneself and others from time to time.  A.iv.160f; cp.  Vin.ii.202.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dappula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dappula.-Second son of Mahātissa and Sanghasivā, his brothers being Aggabodhi and Maniakkhika.  Among his sons was Mānavamma, and it was with his help that he became King Dappula I.  on the death of Kassapa II.  But he reigned in Anurādhapura for only seven days, after which Hatthadātha (Dāthopatissa II.) captured the throne.  Dappula thereupon retired to Rohana and ruled as king there for three years (650-3 A.C.).  His wife was the daughter of Silādātha (Silāmeghavanna) (Cv.xlv, 16-22, 36ff, 51ff).  Dappula was a very pious follower of the Buddha and erected many vihāras, repaired others, and made an image of Metteyya, fifteen cubits high.  (For details of his doings see Cv.xli.53ff).  He died from grief at the death of his son Mānavamma, who was killed by Hatthadātha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dappula.-Nephew of Aggabodhi VI.  When Mahinda II.  succeeded Aggabodhi VII.  Dappula rose against him, but, in spite of several attempts, failed to overcome him.  He thereupon retired to Rohana where he ruled, having formed a treaty with Mahinda.  Some time later, he made another attempt to win the throne and fought to fierce battle at Mahāummāra, where he was defeated and forced to flee (CV.xlviii.90, 98, 109, 122, 125, 131, 155f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dappula.-Younger brother of Aggabodhi VIII., whom he succeeded to the throne as Dappula II, (812 - 28 A.C.).  He had a senāpati called Vajira and a daughter named Devā.  His sister was married to Mahinda, ruler of Rohana, and Dappula adopted Mahinda's sons when they were driven away by their father.  Dappula rebuilt the Hatthikucchi°, Vāhadīpa° and Lāvarāvapabbata-vihāras, and enlarged the Mahāpāli Hall, in addition to various other acts of piety.  Cv.xlix.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Dappula.-A nephew of King Dappula II.  and brother of Kittaggabodhi (Cv.xlix.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Dappula.-Yuvarājā of Kassapa V., and afterwards his successor as Dappula III.  He reigned for only seven months (in 923 A.C.) (Cv.lii.42; liii.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Dappula.-Yuvarājā of Dappula III.  and afterwards king, Dappula IV.  (923-34 A.C.).  During his reign the Pandu king came to Ceylon to seek his help against the Colas.  Dappula was willing to help him but was opposed by his mother.  Dappula's commander was Rakkhaka Ilanga, who built a dwelling called after the king.  Cv.liii.4-12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasava Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was a brahmin of Magadha who, having heard the Buddha preach at Dakkhināgiri, entered the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a brahmin ascetic named Suvaccha, versed in the three Vedas.  The Buddha appeared before him, and he paid him homage by scattering nāga-flowers in his path.  Thirty-one kappas ago he was a king named Mahāratha (Thag.107; ThagA.i.214f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Nāgapupphiya of the Apadāna.

Sumedha) and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;his mother Sumedhā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ten thousand years he lived in the household, in three palaces, Hamsā, Koñcā and Mayūrā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife was Padumā and his son Usabhakkhandha (Samavatakkhandha).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left home on an elephant and practised austerities for ten months.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Bodhi-tree was the Pipphalī and grass for his seat was given by an Ājīvaka named Sunanda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first sermon was preached at Nandārāma (Sunandārāma) at Sirighara, where he converted the heretics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had three great gatherings of his followers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was always attended by eighty-four thousand arahants, and his body was eighty cubits in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He died at Nandārāma at the age of one hundred thousand years and his thūpa was thirty-six yojanas high.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sumangala and Tissa were his chief monks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nandā and Sunandā his chief nuns, while &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāgata (v.l.  Nanda) was his constant attendant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapassu and Bhallika were his chief lay patrons among men and Sirimā and Sonā among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during the time of Dīpankara Buddha that the ascetic &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedha,Sumedha')"&gt;Sumedha&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.), who later became &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;- &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, first declared his intention of becoming an aspirant for Enlightenment (a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Dīpankara's death, his doctrine lasted for one hundred thousand years.  Bu.ii.207ff; BuA.104f; J.i.29; Mhv.i.5; Dpv.iii.31; DhA.i.69; but see Mtu.i.193ff., where the details differ from those given here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dīpankara&lt;/b&gt;.-See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhappiya,Buddhappiya')"&gt;Buddhappiya&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dīghataphala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha resident in a palm tree outside Rājagaha.  Kālavilangika's wife, disguised as a man, taking food from the palace to an impaled man, passed under his tree and was seized as his prey.  But on learning that she was the king's messenger, the yakkha released her and asked her to convey the news that Dīghataphala's wife Kālī, daughter of the god Sumana, had given birth to a son.  In return for this service, Dīghataphala gave the messenger the treasure buried under the tree.  She went about shouting the news, and Sumana, hearing it, gave her more treasure.  MA.ii.818.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammaguttā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhammaguttā, Dhammaguttikā.-A secondary division of the Mahimsāsakas (Dpv.v.47; Mhv.v.8; Mbv., p.96), probably an offshoot of the Sabbatthivādins.  They had a special Vinaya of their own.  According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, pp.185, 192), they were called after their leader, Dharmagupta.  Their fundamental doctrines were these: that the Buddha is not comprised in the Sangha; that while there is great reward for offerings made to the Buddha, there is none for offerings to the Sangha; that a life of brahmacariya exists also among the devas; and that there are worldly laws as opposed to spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammaguttā.-A Vemanika-peta, mentioned as having the power of travelling through the air.  Vsm.382.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dona Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin, Dona (probably identical with Dona 1 above), visits the Buddha and asks if it be true that the Buddha does not honour brahmins.  The Buddha tells him that there are five kinds of brahmins - the Brahma-like, the deva-like, the bound, the breaker of bonds, and the brahmin-outcast - and, at Dona's request, describes these in detail (A.iii.223ff).  The classification of brahmins given in this sutta is often referred to.  E.g., SNA.i.318, 325, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhajavihetha Jātaka (No.391)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wizard was wont to come at midnight in order to corrupt the queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  She complained to the king and, at his request, she set the mark on her hand with vermillion on his back.  By day the man was an ascetic, and when he found that he was discovered he fled through the air.  The king thereupon suspected all ascetics and ordered them all to leave the kingdom.  The king became a heretic.  The Bodhisatta who was born as Sakka, seeing all this, came to Benares with an old Pacceka Buddha and stood close to the palace, showing him great reverence.  When the king came out Sakka revealed his identity, telling him that even the ruler of the gods honoured pious men.  The king saw his error and mended his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the story is given in the Mahākanha Jātaka.  The king is identified with Ananda.  J.iii.303-7. More or less the same story is given at greater length and with several variations in detail in both the Cullahamsa and the Mahāhamsa Jātakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dujīpa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king who lived to the age of one thousand.  He reigned for five hundred years and, at the end of that period, gave alms to the brahmins, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic (J.vi.203).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Dudīpa, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, who is mentioned (J.vi.99) as having given away great wealth, and as a result reached heaven.  v.l.  Dudīpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dasabala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dasabala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Buddha, possessor of the ten powers, the four confidences, etc., preaches the nature of the five khandhas and the arising and the passing away of dukkha.  S.ii.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dasabala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Buddha, possessor of the ten powers, etc., urges on his followers the desirability of putting forth supreme effort and earnestness in order to win salvation (S.ii.28f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dasabala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-See Buddha Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammavādi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk who lived in the time of Kassapa Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, another monk, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/adhammavaadi,Adhammavādi')"&gt;Adhammavādi&lt;/a&gt;, was charged with having violated the rules of the Vinaya, and Dhammavādi decided against him.  &lt;p&gt;But Adhammavādi succeeded in getting two others to give a verdict in his favour.  &lt;p&gt;These two monks were later born as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata,Hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira,Sātāgira')"&gt;Sātāgira&lt;/a&gt;.  SNA.i.195f.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dantabhumi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jayasena,Jayasena')"&gt;Jayasena&lt;/a&gt; visits the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aciravata,Aciravata')"&gt;Aciravata&lt;/a&gt; at the Forest Hut in Veluvana and asks him to explain how a monk whose life is strenuous and purged of self can find peace in his heart.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of Aciravata's discourse, Jayasena leaves him, complaining that the matter is not at all clear to him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aciravata mentions the matter to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, who says that Jayasena cannot understand such matters, being too fond of pleasure and undisciplined.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He illustrates his meaning by various examples, one being a description of the catching and taming of a wild elephant.  M.iii.128ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasangaha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidently another and earlier name for the Dhammasangani.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name occurs in the Sumangalavilāsini (DA.i.17) in the classification of the Abhidhamma books.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Commentary is also referred to as the Dhammasangahatthakathā.  E.g., VibhA.391, 43, 105, 518; PSA.405.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhūmarakkha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain in Ceylon, not far from Kacchakatittha, no the right bank of the Mahāvālukanadī.  There Pandukābhaya defeated his uncles and occupied their fortified camp for two years.  The mountain was the abode of yakkhas, and it was here that Pandukābhaya captured the Yakkhinī Cetiyā, near the pond Tumbariyangana in the vicinity of the mountain (Mhv.x.46, 53, 58ff).  King Mahānāma built a vihāra there (Cv.xxxvii.213).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.289), the mountain was also called Udumabarapabbata (or -giri).  There seems (See P.L.C., s.v.  Udumbaragiri) to have lived at Udumbaragiri a fraternity of forest-dwelling monks who produced from among their number several scholars of great repute and monks of great piety - e.g., Kassapa and Medhankara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mountain is identified (Ep.  Zey.ii.194ff) with the present "Gunners' Quoin" on the right bank of the Mahāvaliganga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Duyyodhana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Duyyodhana.-The Bodhisatta, born as king of Magadha.  He was later born as king of the Nāgas, under the name of Sankhapāla.  For his story see the Sankhapāla Jātaka.  S.v.162ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Duyyodhana.-The Pāli form of the Sanskrit Duryodhana.  E.g., Cv.lxiv.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dārukkhandha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dārukkhandha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Sāriputta, coming down Gijjhakuta, sees a log of wood, and tells the monks that a wise person could see all the elements in that log.  A.iii.340.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dārukkhandha Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-The Buddha, while staying at Kosambī, sees a great log of wood floating down the river, and tells the monks that just as the log, if it does not ground on a bank, or sink in midstream, or stick on a shoal, or fall into human or non-human hands, or get caught in a whirlpool, or rot inwardly, will, without doubt, float down to the ocean; so will a monk, without doubt, float down to Nibbāna if he escapes the dangers on the way.  The monks ask what the dangers are, and the Buddha explains them, on the analogy of the dangers besetting the log.  At the end of the discourse, the cowherd Nanda, who had been listening, joined the Order.  S.iv.179f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Dārukkhandha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The same as the above, except that the place mentioned is Kimbilā, and the explanations are given to Kimbila.  S.iv.181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Devala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-An ascetic who once came from the region of Himavā in search of vinegar and honey and took refuge for the night in a potter's house.  Another ascetic, Nārada (the Bodhisatta), arrived later at the hut and, with the permission of Devala, stayed there.  During the night, Nārada, going out of the hut, trod on the locks of Devala who lay right across the doorway.  He asked for pardon, and returning, passed by what he took to be Devala's feet, but Devala had turned round and Nārada again trod on his hair.  Devala thereupon cursed him, saying that, at sunrise, his head would split in seven pieces; but Nārada stopped the sun from rising.  The king enquired as to what had happened, and, on learning the story, forced Devala to ask Nārada's pardon.  As he did not do this of his own free will, he was taken, at Nārada's suggestion, to a pond and made to stand up to his neck in water with a lump of clay on his head.  As soon as the sun rose the lump of clay split in seven pieces and Devala swam away.  Devala is identified with Thulla-Tissa.  DhA.i.32ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaaladevala,Kāladevala')"&gt;Kāladevala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Devala&lt;/b&gt;.-Cousin of Padumuttara Buddha and later his aggasāvaka.  Padumuttara's first sermon was addressed to him and his brother Sujāta.  Bu.xi.24; BuA.159; Ap.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-An ascetic in Himavā.  He lived before the time of Padumuttara Buddha, who was yet in Tusita, but realizing in his mind the qualities of previous Buddhas, Devala built a cetiya on the bank of a river and made offerings to it in the name of the Buddha.  Later, he was born in the Brahma-world.  He was a previous birth of Sirimatthera (Pulinuppādaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ThagA.i.280; Ap.ii.426.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Devala.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka Buddha.  When Upāli was once born as Sunanda, the king's son, one day, when riding on an elephant, he saw Devala and insulted him.  It was for this reason that he was born in a low caste in his last life.  ThagA.i.368.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dutthatthaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third Sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta (SN.vs.780-87).  The sutta was preached in reference to the calumny raised against the Buddha by the heretics who used the female ascetic Sundarī to further their ends (SNA.ii.518f).  Commentarial explanation of this is included in the Mahāniddesa (i.62ff).  The burden of the sutta is that he who praises his own virtue and is dependent upon varying dogmas of philosophy is constantly censured.  The muni is one who has shaken off all systems of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daddara &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Daddara (Daddarapabbata).&lt;/b&gt;-A mountain in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava,Himavā')"&gt;Himavā&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.8, 67; iii.16; Ap.ii.536); it is the same as the Rajatapabbata (q.v.), which was called Daddara on account of the thunder playing round it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Daddara (Daddaranāgabhavana).&lt;/b&gt;-An abode of the Nāgas at the foot of the Daddara mountain.  J.iii.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Daddara (Daddarapura).&lt;/b&gt;-A city founded by the fifth son of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/u2_uy,Upacara')"&gt;Upacara&lt;/a&gt; on a spot where two mountains rubbing together made the sound daddara.  J.iii.461.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Daddara.&lt;/b&gt;-See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha,Mahādaddara')"&gt;Mahādaddara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He once saw Atthadassī Buddha passing through the air and, much pleased, offered homage in his direction.  In another birth he was a king named Gosujāta (Ap.i.183).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/deva,Deva')"&gt;Deva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaa,Devā')"&gt;Devā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deva Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-The struggle of the devas and the asuras is typical of that of the monks with Māra; victory is sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, until the enemy is completely crushed and rendered ineffective.

His father's kingdom was restored to him, and he married Brahmadatta's daughter (Vin.i.343ff; DhA.i.46f; J.iii.211f, 487).  He was the Bodhisatta (J.iii.490).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He was born in the Sarana pleasance in the city of Sarana, his father being a khattiya named Sarana, and his mother Sunandā.  It is said that on the day of his birth all unjust laws disappeared from the law-books, hence his name.  For eight thousand years he lived in the household, in three palaces - Araja, Viraja and Sudassana.  His chief wife was Vicitolī and his son Puññavaddhana.  He left the world travelling in his palace, accompanied by all his retinue.  For seven days he practised austerities; his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavapālaka, named Sirivaddha, gave grass for his seat; his bodhi-tree was a bimbijāla-tree.  His first sermon was preached at Isipatana.  Later he preached to King Sañjaya of Tagara, and to Sakka, who was the Bodhisatta.  The Buddha's half-brothers, Paduma and Phussadeva, became his chief disciples, and Hārita was chief of those who practised the dhutangas.  The Buddha's personal attendant was Sunetta, his chief women disciples being Khemā and Sabba-(Sacca)-dinnā.  Subhadda and Katisaha were the chief among men of his lay patrons, and Sāliyā and Valiyā among women.  The Buddha's body was eighty cubits high and he lived to be one hundred thousand years old, dying at the Kesārāma in Sālavati.  Bu.xvi.1ff; BuA.182ff; J.i.38, 39, 40, 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammadassī.-A monk of Pagan, author of the Pāli grammar, Vaccavācaka.  Bode.  op.  cit., p.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhināpatha)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the old Pāli literature the name Dakkhināpatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upper Godāvarī.  Thus, we are told that Bāvarī had his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., vs.976).  Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhināpatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district.  Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhinūpathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhināpatha is spoken of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhināpatha as the road leading to the &lt;b&gt;Dakkhinajanapada&lt;/b&gt;, while the Sumangala-Vilāsinī (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhināpatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangāya dakkhinato pākatajanapadam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan.  It is possible that Dakkhināpatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the Godāvarī being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed.  (For a detailed description see Law: Geog.  of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff).  In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhināpatha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dakkhināpatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.).  It held also a large number of ascetics (DA.i.265), and in the "southern districts" (Dakkhinesu janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana (A.v.216).  See Dharana Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammavādi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta says, in answer to a question by Jambukhādaka, that those who preach the doctrine of abandoning lust and hatred and illusion are real preachers.  To be able to do this, they must practise the doctrine which they preach, and the method of such practice is the Ariyan Eightfold Path.  S.iv.252; cp.261f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhanuggaha-Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Elder.  One night, while staying with his friend Utta (Datta?) in a monastery in Kosala, he awoke and, lighting a fire, started talking to him.  Their conversation turned on the war which Pasenadi was waging against Ajātasattu.  Tissa, maintaining that Pasenadi was ignorant of the arts of war, proceeded to describe in detail what Pasenadi should do if he wished for victory.  Some courtiers, overhearing the conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the battle and captured Ajātasattu alive.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related the Vaddhaki-sūkara Jātaka (q.v.) to show that in the past, too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f).  The Tacchasūkara Jātaka (J.iv.343, 354) was also related in this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Buddhaghosa composed the Sumangalavilāsinī, and Dhammapāla wrote the tīkā to the Viduddhimagga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Datthabba Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-The five powers - of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and insight - and where they are to be seen.  A.iii.12; S.v.196.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Datthabbena Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-He who regards pleasant feelings as ill, painful feelings as a barb, and neutral feelings as impermanence, such a one is called "rightly seeing." S.iv.207.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dāyagāma-vihāra&lt;/b&gt;.-A monastery in Rohana, built by Dhātusena.  Cv.xxxviii.49.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dāyapassa&lt;/b&gt;.-A park near Benares.  Sankicca once stayed there with his followers.  J.v.264, 265.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasangāhaka Therā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the Elders who took part in the Three Councils.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These Elders sometimes inserted in the Canon additional information by way of explanation or of summarising what has gone before.  E.g., D.ii.128, 134, 135, 167; as explained by DA.ii.568, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dāsīvimāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a slave-woman of Sāvatthi.  Her master heard the Buddha preach, and gave alms every day to four monks.  She was entrusted with this duty, which she discharged conscientiously.  For sixteen years she observed the sīlas, and one day, after listening to the Dhamma, she became a Sotāpanna.  After death, she was born as one of Sakka's companions and met Moggallāna, to whom she related her story.  Vv.ii.1; VvA.91ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dakkhināgiri (Vihara)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dakkhināgiri (v.l.  Dakkhinagiri)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A janapada (district) in India, the capital of which was Ujjeni, and over which Asoka ruled as Viceroy.  It also contained the city of Vedisā (Sp.i.70; Mhv.xiii.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dakkhināgiri lay to the south of Rājagaha, beyond the hills that surrounded the city - hence its name (SNA.i.136; MA.ii.795; SA.i.188).  In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanālā (SN., p.13).  The road from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha lay through Dakkhināgiri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhināgiri-vihāra in Ekanālā (S.i.172; SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80).  It was during one of these tours that he converted Kasī-Bhāradvāja and Dhammasava (q.v.) and his father.  On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287).  Ananda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhināgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ananda the censure of Mahā Kassapa (S.ii.217f).  Later, we find Punna with a large following in Dakkhināgiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights (Vin.ii.289).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dakkhināgiri was the residence of Nandamātā of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna during a tour in the district (A.iv.64).  In Dakkhināgiri, Sāriputta heard of the lack of zeal of Dhānañjāni (M.ii.185; see J.i.224 for another incident connected with Sāriputta's tour).  The Arāmadūsa Jātaka (q.v.) was preached in Dakkhināgiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dakkhināgiri-vihāra was, for a long time, a great monastic centre, and at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa there were present from there forty thousand monks led by Mahā Sangharakkhita.  Mhv.xxix.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Dakkhināgiri-vihāra.&lt;/b&gt;-See Dakkhināgiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dakkhināgiri-vihāra&lt;/b&gt;.-A monastery built by Saddhātissa in Ceylon (Mhv.xxxiii.7).  It was restored by Dhātusena (Cv.xxxviii.46), and Kassapa V.  granted a village for its maintenance (Cv.lii.60).  It is probably identical with the Dakkhināgiridalha-vihāra, in which Aggabodhi I.  erected an assembly-hall (Cv.xlii.27).  It has sometimes been identified with the present Mulkirigala-vihāra (Cv.Trs.i.33, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once the residence of Appihā-Sāmanera (MT.552) and of Kāla Buddharakkhita (MA.i.469).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhamma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhamma.-The Bodhisatta, born as a devaputta in the Kāmāvacara-world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhamma_jat_457,Dhamma Jātaka')"&gt;Dhamma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  In the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha,Milindapañha')"&gt;Milindapañha&lt;/a&gt; (p.212) he is called a yakkha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhamma.-The palace built by Vissakamma for Mahāsudassana, by order of Sakka.  D.ii.180ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhamma.-The lake in front of the palace mentioned above.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dahara Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana to Pasenadi.  Pasenadi hints that the Buddha is young and, as compared with other teachers, not fully enlightened.  The Buddha explains to him that there are four things in the world which must not be lightly regarded on account of their youth - a noble prince, a snake, a fire, and a holy man (bhikkhu).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this sutta which effected the conversion of Pasenadi.  S.i.68f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northern books call it the Kumāradrstānta Sutra (Rockhill: p.49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasangani-geha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building in the centre of the citadel of Anurādhapura.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was evidently built by Kassapa V., who placed therein a copy of the Dhammasangani adorned with manifold jewels, and caused a festal procession to be held in its honour (Cv.lii.50f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda IV.  restored the building.  Cv.liv.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dappulapabbata&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dwelling erected by Udaya I.  (also probably called Dappula) in the Ambuyyāna-vihāra (Cv.xlix.30).  There is also mentioned a Dappulapabbata-vihāra begun by one Mahādeva in the time of King Dappula (perhaps Dappula II.), and completed by Sena I (Cv.l.80).  There may have been two buildings of the same name.  See Cv.Trs.i.126, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dāthāsena&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warrior.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave milk-rice to monks for 20,000 years.  Later he was born in Kubukandha and joined Dutthagāmani, taking a prominent part in the capture of Mahela-nagara.  Then the king's mind was poisoned against him and an elephant was let loose on him.  But he killed it and went to Mahājallika, where he defeated a fisherman of immense strength, then swam across to Cola and was ordained by Mahāvaruna Thera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived for a time in Therambalaka Vihāra, sixty leagues away; but finding it unsuitable, he moved to Lohakūtapabbata-vihāra, fifteen leagues away, and there attained arahantship.  Ras.ii.104f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhātuvibhanga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukkusāti')"&gt;Pukkusāti&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Buddha met at the house of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggava,Bhaggava')"&gt;Bhaggava&lt;/a&gt; the potter.  It deals with the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha by his preaching and, at the end of the sermon, wished to be ordained.  The Buddha asked him to fetch a bowl and robe.  On his way to fetch these, Pukkusāti was killed by a mad cow (M.iii.248ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta forms the suttanta counterpart of the Vibhanga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammasavaniya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera who attained arahantship at the age of seven, having heard the Buddha preach the stanza beginning with "aniccā vata sankhārā." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a Jatila who, while flying through the air, was forced to descend where the Buddha sat preaching, it being impossible to fly over him.  He was afterwards born in Tāvatimsa.  Ap.i.273f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Donapāka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Pasenadi, uncomfortable and short of breath after a heavy meal, visited the Buddha.  The Buddha admonished him on the evils of gluttony and taught the young Sudassana, who came with Pasenadi, a verse to be repeated whenever food was placed before the king.  The king paid the young man one hundred kahāpanas daily for this service.  Pasenadi profited by the lesson and became healthy.  S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f gives a fuller version of this story.  There Sudassana is described as the king's nephew.  This is also probably the incident mentioned at DhA.iv.15f; but the youth there is called Uttara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dadhivāhana Jātaka (No.186)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once four brothers of Kāsi became ascetics in the Himālayas.  The eldest died and was born as Sakka; he visited the others, and gave them, respectively, a magic razor-axe, which could be used as razor or axe; a drum, one side of which drove away elephants, while the other made friends of them; and a bowl from which a stream of curd flowed at its possessor's will.  In a beautiful island far away lived a wild boar who owned a gem which enabled its possessor to travel through the air.  A shipwrecked sailor from Kāsi stole this while the boar slept, and, with it, travelled to the Himālaya.  There he saw the ascetics, and, in exchange for the gem, obtained from them their magic possessions, afterwards returning and killing them, so that he regained the gem.  He then went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and took possession of the throne, becoming known as King Dadhivāhana, because he destroyed his enemies by drowning them in a river of curds.  In his garden grew a mango tree, sprung from a mango which had floated down from Lake Kannamunda.  He sent fruits from this tree as presents to the neighbouring kings, but always pricked the mango stone with a thorn so that it should not bear fruit.  Once, an offended king sent to Dadhivāhana a gardener whom he had bribed to destroy the flavour of the mangoes.  The king gave him employment, but the gardener, by growing bitter creepers round the mango tree, destroyed the flavour of the fruit.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's councillor, discovered the plot and had the creepers uprooted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to illustrate the effects of evil association (J.ii.101-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Duttha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Duttha, &lt;/b&gt; called &lt;b&gt;Dutthakumāra&lt;/b&gt;, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.-A former birth of Devadatta (J.i.327).  His story is given in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saccankira_jat_073,Saccankira Jātaka')"&gt;Saccankira Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Duttha.&lt;/b&gt;-Also called &lt;b&gt;Dutthakumāra&lt;/b&gt;, the son of Kitavāsa.  At his birth soothsayers foretold his death from thirst, and Kitavāsa had lakes and ponds dug in various parts of the capital and waterpots placed everywhere.  One day Duttha saw a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and dashed his bowl to the ground.  He was seized with thirst, and all the water in the city was dried up.  He died, and was reborn in Avīci.  J.ii.194f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Duttha.&lt;/b&gt;-Son of the king of Benares; a previous birth of the cruel Licchavi prince on whose account the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekapanna_jat_149,Ekapanna Jātaka')"&gt;Ekapanna Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.

Dasaratha.&lt;/b&gt;-Another name for Janasandha, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; (see Janasandha 1).  The scholiast (J.ii.299) explains that he was so called because he did with his one chariot what others did with ten chariots (dasahi rathehi kattabbam attano eken'eva rathena karanato Dasaratho ti).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Dasaratha.&lt;/b&gt;-King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, identified with Suddhodana.  See the Dasaratha Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dubbaca Jātaka (No.116)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a very skilled acrobat and travelled about with his teacher who knew the dance of the four javelins.  One day the teacher, in a drunken fit of boasting, announced that he would do the dance of the five javelins - which he did not know - and insisted on doing it against the advice of the Bodhisatta.  The result was that the boaster was impaled on the fifth javelin (J.i.430f).  For the introductory story see the Gijjha Jātaka (No.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dasama&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder (gahapati) of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/a5_az,Atthakanagara')"&gt;Atthakanagara&lt;/a&gt;.  One day, having finished some business which took him to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaliputta')"&gt;Pātaliputta&lt;/a&gt;, he visited the Kukkutārāma to call upon &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;.  Learning that Ananda was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/beluva,Beluvagāma')"&gt;Beluvagāma&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;, he visited him there and held a discussion with him, which is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_naagara_s,Atthakanāgara Sutta')"&gt;Atthakanāgara Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  Later, assembling the monks from Pātaliputta and Vesāli, he entertained them and presented each with two lengths of cloth, while to Ananda he gave a suit of three robes and built for him a cell costing five hundred pieces (M.i.349ff; A.v.342ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that Dasama was so called because in the order of precedence with regard to aristocracy of birth and wealth, he occupied the tenth rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhanusekha (Dhanusekhavā)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the cook of Queen Talatā.  He was born on the same day as Cūlani (q.v.), who was sent to the cook's house as a refuge from Chambhī.  The two boys became playmates.  When Cūlani became king, Dhanusekhavā remained his constant companion, even visiting him unbidden, thus becoming a nuisance, as Cūlani confessed to Bherī (J.v.469, 471, 475).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Duvera or Anāthapindika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anāthapindika visits the Buddha, who tells him of the five guilty fears - that begotten &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;by killing, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;by stealing, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;by wrong indulgence of sensual lust, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;by evil speaking, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;by the drinking of intoxicants &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;- freedom from which, together with possession of the Noble Insight, enables a man to say that he is destined for Enlightenment.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammapadatthakathā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary on the Dhammapada, containing stories similar to those of the Jātakas and explaining the occasions on which the Dhammapada-stanzas were uttered.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A considerable number of these stories are found in the Four Nikāyas and the Vinaya, and more than fifty are either directly derived from the Jātaka Commentary or are closely parallel to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is usually ascribed to Buddhaghosa, and in the prelude to the book it is stated that he translated the work from Sinhalese at the request of a monk named Kumārakassapa.  For a discussion see P.L.C., pp.95ff; and Law: Pāli Lit., pp.449ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dhammadinna &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Dhammadinna Thera.-Also called Mahādhammadinna.  An arahant.  He resided at Talanga-(Talangatissa-pabbata) (q.v.).  He was one of the monks who partook of the meal of sour gruel given by Dutthagāmanī when in dire distress for want of food.  Dhammadinna distributed his share among ten thousand monks in Piyangudīpa (Mhv.xxxii.52).  He is also mentioned (MT.606) as having accepted a meal given by Sāliya and his wife when they were blacksmiths in a previous birth.  Dhammadinna had a nephew who became an arahant in the tonsure-hall.  Dhammadinna read to him the three Pitakas, and he learnt them all on that occasion (VibhA.389).  Dhammadinna's teacher was Mahānāga of Uccatalanka (v.l.  Uccavālika).  Dhammadinna visited him in his old age, knowing that, though he himself thought he had attained arahantship, this was not the case.  By a display of iddhi-power, Dhammadinna convinced Mahānāga of his error and gave him a subject of meditation.  Almost immediately after, the Elder became an arahant (VibhA.489; Vsm.634f).  Once, while preaching the Apannaka Sutta, at Tissamahārāma, Dhammadinna pointed his fan downwards, whereupon the earth opened to the depth of Avīci, revealing all that was there.  Similarly, he showed all things to the height of the Brahma-world.  During his sermon he frightened the audience with the fear of hell and lured them with the bliss of heaven (Vsm.392).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Majjhima Commentary records that soon after the ordination of Dhammadinna many monks, on his advice, became arahants.  (MA.i.149ff.  A variation of what is evidently the same story is found in AA.i.25).  Hearing of this, the monks of Tissamahārāma sent a number of their colleagues to fetch him.  He preached to them, and they attained arahantship and remained with him.  Three times this happened.  On the fourth occasion an aged monk was sent.  He gave the message of the monks and Dhammadinna started at once to go to them.  On the way, at Hankana (v.l.  Tangana) and at Cittalapabbata, he persuaded two monks, who thought they were arahants, to display their iddhi-power, and, thereby convinced them of their error; thereupon he gave them topics of meditation.  On his arrival at Tissamahārāma, the monks failed to pay him their respects.  He thereupon made the earth tremble and returned to his own vihāra.  The Saddhammasangaha (p.88f) relates the story of a blind rat-snake who heard Dhammadinna recite the satipatthānas and was later born as Tissāmacca, minister of Dutthagāmani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Dhammadinna.-An eminent lay-follower of the Buddha.  He once came with five hundred upāsakas to the Buddha at Isipatana and asked him to give them a lesson which might profit them, for, said he, it is difficult for a householder encumbered with a family and the luxuries of household life to comprehend the Buddha's teachings in their fullness.  The Buddha answers that they should practise the four limbs of sotāpatti: loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and the cultivation of Āriyan virtues.  Dhammadinna answers that they already possess these limbs.  The Buddha then expresses his great satisfaction (S.v.406ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.iii.223) says that Dhammadinna was one of seven laymen with followings of five hundred - the others being Visākha, Ugga, Citta, Hatthaka Ālavaka and Cūla- and Mahā-Anāthapindika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Dhammadinna.  A monk of Tissamahā-vihāra near Talañgarapabbata.  Once, while on pilgrimage to Nāgadīpa with 500 others, he stopped at Sāgiri Vihāra, and they were looked after by Bahulamassutissa Thera.  The next day they went for alms to Punnsālakotthaka, where a resident entertained them to a meal with hare's flesh.  Dhammadinna later asked why Tissa Thera did not admonish his follower on the evils of killing, seeing that there was a heap of bones outside the house.  Tissa asked Dhammadinna to do so the next day.  This was done; the devotee confessed that he had never killed a hare, but in his house there was never any want of hare's flesh, and he did not know why.  Dhammadinna, with his divine eye, revealed to him that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had given alms with hare's flesh.  Ras.ii.128f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
