  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pūtimamsa Jātaka (No.  437)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, on the slopes of the Himālaya, lived a jackal called Pūtimamsa with his mate Venī.  Near by dwelt a flock of wild goats.  Pūtimamsa formed a device for killing the goats one by one and eating their flesh, till only a she goat, called Melamātā, was left.  Wishing to devour her as well, Pūtimamsa suggested to Venī that he should pretend to be dead and that Venī should then entice Melamātā into the cave by asking her to assist in the funeral rites.  But the goat was wise and observant and discovered the ruse.  Venī went to her later and saying that Pūtimamsa had recovered consciousness at the very sight of her, invited her to join them in a feast to celebrate his recovery.  Melamātā, agreed, saying that she would bring with her a large escort of her friends, fierce dogs, including Maliya, Pingiya, Caturakkha and Jambuka, in order that the celebration might be a great one.  At this suggestion Pūtimamsa and Venī fled from their cave, taking rescue elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to the monks in order to impress on them the necessity for keeping guard over their senses.  J.iii.532ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Purābheda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tenth sutta of the Atthaka Vagga of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sutta_nipata,Sutta Nipāta')"&gt;Sutta Nipāta&lt;/a&gt;.  It was among the suttas preached at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s,Mahāsamaya')"&gt;Mahāsamaya&lt;/a&gt; in answer to the questions asked of the Buddha by the created Buddha (SNA.ii.548).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a long disquisition on the characteristics of a calm sage (upasanta).  He is free from craving, anger, etc., is equable and thoughtful, possessed of calm, and walk's in the path of righteous men (SN.  vs.  848 61).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached for the benefit of the buddhi caritā.  SNA.i.361; MNid.  223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnanadī Jātaka (No.  214)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once chaplain at the court of Brahmadatta, king of Benares.  But the king, listening to his enemies, sent the Bodhisatta away from the court, and he dwelt in a village of Kāsi.  Later, the king, remembering his chaplain's goodness, composed a verse, wrote it on a leaf, and sent it to him, together with cooked crow's flesh.  The Bodhisatta understood the message and returned to the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the great wisdom of the Buddha.  Ananda is identified with the king (J.ii.173 5).  The Jātaka derives its name from the first two words of the verse composed by the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potaliya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Potaliya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A householder of Āpana.  Meeting the Buddha in a wood outside the town, he greeted him, and was addressed by the Buddha as "householder," at which he was very angry, for he had, so he said, handed over his wealth to his sons, and possessed only his food and clothing.  But the Buddha told him that true retirement from the household meant far more than that, and, at the request of Potaliya, he proceeded to explain his words.  At the end of the discourse Potaliya declared himself the Buddha's follower.  M.i.359 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Potaliya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wanderer (Paribbājāka) probably identical with the above (1).  A conversation he had with the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya.  At the end of the discussion he declared himself the Buddha's follower.  A.ii.100f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyadassī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Piyadassī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thirteenth of the twenty four Buddhas.  He was born in Sudhañña (Sudassana) and his mother was Sucandā (Candā).  He was called Piyadassī because he showed many pleasing miracles.  For nine thousand years he lived as a layman in three palaces: Sunimala Vimala and Giriguhā (Giribrahā).  His wife was Vimalā and his son Kañcanavela (Kañcana).  He left home in a chariot and practised austerities for six months.  He was given milk rice by Vasabha's daughter and grass for his seat by the Ajīvaka Sujāta.  His, bodhi was a Kakudha tree.  Among his converts were the deva king Sudassana and the elephant Donamukha.  A monk named Sona conspired with Prince Mahāpaduma to kill the Buddha, Donamukha being the elephant they used in their unsuccessful plot.  cp.  Nālāgiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piyadassī's chief disciples were Pālita and Sabbadassī among monks and Sujātā and Dhammadinnā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sobhita.  Sannaka and Dhammika were his chief lay patrons among men, and Visākhi and Dhammadinnā among women.  He lived for ninety thousand years and died at Assatthārāma, his thūpa being three leagues in height.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta of that time was a brahmin named Kassapa, and he built a monastery for the Buddha at a cost of one hundred thousand crores.  Bu.xiv.1ff.; BuA.172ff.; J.i.38f., etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Piyadassī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha.  M.iii.69; Ap.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Piyadassī Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  He was present with sixty thousand others, from Jetārāma, at the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Dpv.xix.15; Mhv.xxix.32).  He stood on the north east side at the ceremony, and at the close of it he preached to Dutthagāmanī.  Ibid., 65; MT.  531.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Piyadassī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Sudassananigama, whose daughter gave milk rice to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii,Sikhī')"&gt;Sikhī&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.  BaA.  201.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Piyadassī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera of Ceylon, incumbent of the Devarāja vihāra.  He was a pupil of the grammarian Moggallāna and wrote the Pāli grammar, Padasādhana.  P.L.C.  205.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Piyadassī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammaasoka,Dhammāsoka')"&gt;Dhammāsoka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Posiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a very rich banker in Sāvatthi and the younger brother of Sangāmajita.  When grown up, he married and had a son.  Soon after, he left the world to join the Order and, dwelling alone in the forest, became an arahant.  Once, when he went to Sāvatthi to worship the Buddha, he visited his home.  His former wife entertained him, but when he saw that she was trying to tempt him, he hurried away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a hunter.  The Buddha, out of compassion for him, went to the forest and stood near him.  He provided the Buddha with a seat of grass and paid him homage.  Soon after, he was killed by a lion (Thag.vs.34; ThagA.i.96 ff).  He is probably identical with Tinamutthidāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.280; see also ii.  p.455.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phala Jātaka (No.  54)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a caravan leader, and, while travelling along a road which led through a forest, advised his followers to eat neither fruit, flower nor leaf, without first obtaining his leave.  Near a village, on the outskirts of the forest, grew a kimpakka-tree, which, in every respect, resembled a mango tree.  Some of the men ate of it, and their leader, when he knew this, gave them medicine which cured them.  The next day the villagers rushed up to the tree hoping to find all the members of the caravan dead, like those of former caravans, leaving the villagers to rob their goods.  They were amazed on finding these men alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a gardener employed by a squire in Sāvatthi.  He took some monks round the garden and was amazed to find that they could tell the condition of a mango by looking at the tree.  J.i.270 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pulacceri&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pulacceri&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park laid out by Parakkamabāhu I.  Cv.lxxix.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pulacceri&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landing place in Ceylon where Māgha and Jayabāhu set up fortifications.  Cv.lxxxiii.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulatthi nagara( pura).  A capital of the Singhalese kings.  It is first heard of in the reign of Aggabodhi III., who built in the town the Mahāpānadīpa vihāra (Cv.xliv.122).  But it was probably an important centre even earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthagāmanī, was probably near by (See Codrington, op.  cit., 20).  Sena I.  first made Pulatthipura the capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time it seems to have been used as a royal residence - e.g., by Aggabodhi IV.  (Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII.  (Ibid.,xlviii.74), and Udaya I.  (Ibid.,xlix.9, 18), who built a hospital there.  Kassapa IV.is also mentioned as building a hospital against an epidemic (Cv.lii.25).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda II.  built in the city the Dāmavihāra parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra (Cv.xlviii.134).  Sena I.  reigned in Pulatthipura for twenty years and erected there several buildings, including the Senaggabodhi shrine near the Thusavāpī (Ibid.,l.73).  The successors of Sena I.  found in Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and the Pāndiyans; but in the time of Sena V.  the town fell into the hands of the Damilas, through the treachery of Sena's mother and his commander in chief, Sena.  But Sena V.  recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68).  About 1017 A.C.  the Colas overran the country, captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner.  He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff).  During this period many of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many years the Colas held the sovereignty of the city, though the Singhalese made several vain attempts to drive them out.  The Colas named the city Jananāthapura and put down all rebellion with a strong hand.  Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of Vijayabāhu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura.  His first attempts failed, partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land.  But, owing to dissensions among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff).  He renamed the city Vijayarājapura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff).  It was not, however, till the time of Parakkamabāhu I.  that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its greatness.  He enlarged it to the size of four gāvutas in length and seven in width and called it Parakkamapura.  The city had three suburbs Rāvjavesībhujanga, Rājakulantaka and Vijita - and fourteen gates.  Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were the Nandanavana and the Dīpuyyāna, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff).  Kittinissanka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19).  In the reign of Līlavatī, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months.  He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapandu ruled as king, till he was deposed about 1215 A.C.  by Māgha of the Kalinga race, who, coming with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff).  From this spoliation the city never completely recovered, and it gradually lost its importance, though Parakkamabāhu II., Vijayabāhu IV.  and Parakkamabāhu III.  made attempts to restore it to its original splendour.  Ibid., lxxxvii.67; lxxxviii.28, 35, 89, 92, 120f.; lxxxix.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pinda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Buddha was at Pañcasālā when the day came for all young people to send gifts to each other.  The Buddha went to the village for alms, but the villagers, influenced by Māra, gave him nothing, and he returned with his empty bowl.  Māra tried to influence the Buddha to go a second time, but this he refused to do (S.i.113; the incident is also found at DhA.iii., p.  257f).  The Commentary says (SA.i.141) that Māra did not want the Buddha to accept the gifts of the maidens and to preach to them, because then they would pass beyond his evil influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pubbakammapiloti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chapter in the Apadāna (Ap.i.299 ff ) which gives incidents from several lives of the Bodhisatta in explanation of the reason for which the Buddha suffered in various ways during his last life - e.g., from persecutions at the hands of his enemies and from various bodily ills.  Most of the incidents mentioned are not to be found in the Jātakas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chapter is described as a Buddhāpadāna (Ibid., 301), but there is no reference either to it or to the incidents recounted in the chapter entitled Buddhāpadāna which is found at the beginning of the Apadāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Pilotikamma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyajātika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells a householder, who is mourning for his son, that dear ones always bring sorrow and tribulation.  The man, however, disagreed with this view and did not scruple to say so wherever he went.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; taunted&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"&gt;Mallikā&lt;/a&gt; with this, and she sent Nālijangha to the Buddha to ask if these were his words.  The Buddha convinced him by means of various examples that the statement was true, and when this was reported to Mallikā, she was able to prove to Pasenadi that the Buddha's teaching was in accordance with facts.  M.ii.106 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Punna, Punnaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in the family of a householder of Suppāraka in the Sunāparanta country.  When he was grown up, he went with a great caravan of merchandise to Sāvatthi where, having heard the Buddha preach, he left the world and joined the Order.  He won favour by attention to his duties.  One day he asked the Buddha for a short lesson so that, having learnt it, he might go back to dwell in Sunāparanta.  The Buddha preached to him the Punnovāda Sutta (q.v.).  So Punna departed, and, in Sunāparanta, he became an arahant.  There he won over many disciples, both male and female, and having built for the Buddha a cell out of red sandalwood (Candanāsālā), he sent him a flower by way of invitation.  The Buddha came with five hundred arahants, spent a night in the cell, and went away before dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety one kappas ago, when there was no Buddha alive, Punna was a learned brahmin, and later became a hermit in Himavā.  Near his abode a Pacceka Buddha died, and at the moment of his death there appeared a great radiance.  The ascetic cremated the body and sprinkled scented water on the pyre to extinguish the flames.  A deva, witnessing the event, prophesied his future greatness.  His name throughout his many lives was Punna or Punnaka.  Thag.  vs.  70; ThagA.i.156 ff.; Ap.ii.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sunāparanta he first lived at Ambahatthapabbata, but, on being recognised by his brother, he went to Samuddagiri vihāra, where was a magnetised walk which none could use.  The waves of the sea breaking made great noise, and, in order to help him to concentration, Punna caused the sea to be quiet.  From there he went to Mātulagiri, where the incessant cries of birds disturbed him; he finally went to Makulakagāma.  While he was there, his brother Cūla Punna, with five hundred others, sailed in a trading ship, and, before embarking, he visited Punna, took the precepts from him, and asked for his protection during the voyage.  The ship reached an island where red sandalwood grew; with this the merchants filled the ship, and the spirits of the island, angered by this, raised a great storm and appeared before the sailors in fearful forms.  Each merchant thought of his guardian deity and Cūla Punna of his brother.  Punna, sensing his brother's need, travelled through the air to the ship, and, at sight of him, the spirits disappeared.  In gratitude for their deliverance, the merchants gave to the Elder a share of their sandalwood.  It was with this material that the Candanasālā, above referred to, was built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kundadhāna was the first among the arahants to be chosen to accompany the Buddha to Sunāparanta.  Sakka provided five hundred palanquins for the journey, one of which was empty.  This was subsequently taken by the ascetic Saccabandha, whom the Buddha converted and ordained on the way.  On his return journey, the Buddha stopped at the river Nammadā, and was entertained there by the Nāga king.  MA.ii.1014 ff.; SA.iii.14ff.; KhA.149.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Punna, Punnaka&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Rājagaha (DhA.i.385; iii.104), father of Uttarā Nanda-Mātā.  He had been a poor man and had worked for the setthi Sumana.  One feast day, though his master offered him a holiday, he went to work in the field, because he was too poor to be able to enjoy himself.  While he was in the field Sāriputta came to him, and Punna gave him a tooth stick and water.  Punna's wife, coming with her husband's food, met Sāriputta as he was coming away, and offered him the food she carried.  She cooked fresh rice and took it to her husband, who was overjoyed to hear of her gift to Sāriputta.  After the meal, he rested his head for a while on his wife's lap, and, on awaking, he found that the field he had ploughed had turned into gold.  He reported the matter to the king, who sent carts to fetch the gold; but as soon as his men touched it, saying that it was for the king, it turned again into earth.  The gold was, therefore, gathered in Punna's name, and the king conferred on him the rank of Bahudhanasetthi.  He built a new house, and, at the feast of inauguration, held a great almsgiving to the Buddha and the monks.  When the Buddha thanked him, he and his wife and his daughter Uttarā (q.v.) became sotāpannas.  MA.ii.812; DhA.iii.302 ff.; also VvA.62ff., where Punnaka's wife is called Uttarā.  In the Anguttara, Commentary (i.  240 ff.) the man's name is given as Punnasīha, of which Punna is the shortened form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is this Punna, described as bhataka, that is mentioned in the Milindapañha (pp.  115, 291; see also MA.ii.812) among the seven people whose acts of devotion brought reward in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Punna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slave of Mendaka (q.v.).  He was one of the five persons of Great Merit (Pañca Mahāpuññā) (AA.i.219; DhA.i.385).  When he ploughed the field with a single plough he made fourteen furrows, seven on each side.  Vsm.383.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Punna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A servitor (dabbigāhaka) who held the oblation ladles for the seven sages, mentioned in the Assalāyana Sutta (M.ii.157; MA.ii.785); they were rebuked by Asita Devala for their pretensions regarding the superiority of brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Punna Koliyaputta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naked ascetic (Acela) who visited the Buddha at Haliddavasana, together with Seniya Kukkuravatika.  Punna questioned the Buddha regarding the practices of Seniya, while Seniya did likewise regarding those of Punna.  The discussion is recorded in the Kukkuravatika Sutta (q.v.).  At the end of the discussion, Punna declared himself a follower of the Buddha.  He is called Govatika (one who behaved like a cow) (M.i.387 ff).  Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.624) that, in order to support his bovine character, he wore horns and a tail and browsed on the grass in the company of cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Punna &lt;a name="Mantaniputta"&gt;Mantānīputta&lt;/a&gt; Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/d2_v,Donavatthu')"&gt;Donavatthu&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;.  His mother was&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mantaanii,Mantānī')"&gt;Mantānī&lt;/a&gt;, sister of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/annaa_kondanna,Aññākondañña')"&gt;Aññākondañña&lt;/a&gt;.  While the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, whither he had gone after preaching the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana,Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, Aññākondañña went to Kapilavatthu and ordained Punna.  Kondañña then returned to Rājagaha, whence, having taken leave of the Buddha, he retired to live on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chaddanta,Chaddantadaha')"&gt;Chaddantadaha&lt;/a&gt;.  But Punna remained in Kapilavatthu, intent on his practices, and soon after became an arahant.  He gathered round him five hundred clansmen who all became monks, and he taught them the ten bases of discourse (dasa kathāvatthūni), which he himself had learnt, and they became arahants.  When they wished to visit the Buddha, Punna sent them on in advance to Rājagaha, asking them to pay homage to the Buddha in his name.  Later, when the Buddha came from Rājagaha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, Punna visited him and was taught the Dhamma in the Buddha's own &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt;, hearing of the fame of Punna, wished to meet him, and went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhavana,Andhavana')"&gt;Andhavana&lt;/a&gt;, where Punna was spending his siesta.  Sāriputta questioned him on the seven acts of purity, and Punna answered him.  The two monks found great joy in each other's words.  The interview with Sāriputta is given in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/rathavinita_s,Rathavinīta Sutta')"&gt;Rathavinīta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.146 ff.).  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;, says (MA.i.362) that the two Elders had many things in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the Buddha declared Punna to be pre-eminent among those who preached the Dhamma.  (A.i.23; S.ii.156)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was born in a rich brahmin family of Hamsavatī, before the birth of the Buddha.  When grown up, he one day visited the Buddha, and as he sat on the edge of a large crowd, hearing him preach, the Buddha declared one of his monks pre eminent among preachers, and Punna, wishing for a like honour under a future Buddha, paid great homage to Padumuttara.  (ThagA.i.37 ff )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.113 ff), however, we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Punna was named Gotama and was expert in the Vedas.  But he found no solace in the teaching of the Vedas and became an ascetic with a following of eighteen thousand Jatilas, all of whom, under his guidance, developed great iddhi powers.  Punna was already old when Padumuttara attained Enlightenment.  One day the Buddha visited Gotama's hermitage, and Gotama and his disciples entertained him to a meal.  Afterwards the Buddha wished his chief disciple Mahādeva to come to the hermitage with one hundred thousand monks; this he did, and the ascetics provided flowers for their seats.  For seven days the Buddha and his monks remained in trance on their seats, at the end of which period the Buddha asked the most pre eminent preacher to render thanks.  At the conclusion of the sermon, all except Gotama became arahants.  Gotama wished to gain pre eminence in preaching under a future Buddha, and Padumuttara proclaimed that his wish would find fulfilment.  The Apadāna (Ap.i.38, quoted at ThagA.i.362) contains yet another version, according to which Punna's name in the time of Padumuttara was Sunanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Rathavinīta Sutta mentioned above (n.  1), which bears testimony to Punna's skill as a preacher, another Sutta, of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.105f.; according to ThagA.ii.124, Ananda became a sotāpanna after hearing a sermon by Punna), represents Ananda as saying to the assembled monks that Punna was of great help to himself and others when they were yet novices; Punna had preached to them on causation, and they were able to understand the Doctrine because of his skilful exposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, perhaps, this Punna who is identified with the gate keeper (dovārika) of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276,Kurudhamma Jātaka')"&gt;Kurudhamma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.381) and with one of the seven brothers of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhisa_jat_488,Bhisa Jātaka')"&gt;Bhisa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.314).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvastu (iii.382) contains twenty verses attributed to Pūrna Maitrayānīputra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Punna.  &lt;/b&gt; See also s.v.  Punnaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Punna Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Another name for the Punnovāda Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pītavimānavatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a woman of Rājagaha.  When Ajātasattu erected a thūpa over the Buddha's relics at Rājagaha, she started early one morning with four kosātakī flowers to offer at the thūpa.  On the way there she was gored to death by a cow, and was reborn in Tāvatimsa, wearing yellow garments.  There Moggallāna met her and learned her story.  Vv.iv.9; VvA.200f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tālaputa visits the Buddha and asks him if there be any truth in the tradition that stage actors are born, after death, among the Pahāsadevā.  The Buddha refuses at first to answer the question, but, on being pressed, he says that the truth is that actors are born in the Pahāsa niraya.  Tālaputa thereupon starts to weep to think that he should have been so long deceived.  He enters the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant.  S.iv.306f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phusatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daughter of the Madda king and chief queen of the Sivi king Sañjaya and mother of Vessantara.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had been Sudhammā, daughter of Kikī, and was born in Tāvatimsa because of an offering of sandal wood made by her to Vipassī Buddha.  When she left Tāvatimsa, Sakka gave her ten boons: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to be chief queen, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to have dark eyes, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dark eyebrows, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to be named Phusatī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to have a son, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to keep a slim figure, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to have firm breasts, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hair always dark, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to have soft skin, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to save the condemned.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was called Phusatī because on the day of her birth her body smelt of sandal wood.  She was a previous birth of Mahāmāyā.  J.iv.480 ff., 593; Cyp.i.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Punnā&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slave girl of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sujaataa,Sujātā')"&gt;Sujātā&lt;/a&gt;.  J.i.69; AA.i.218.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Punnā Therī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  She was born in a householder's family of Sāvatthi, and, at the age of twenty, having heard &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Pajāpati Gotamī ')"&gt;Pajāpati Gotamī &lt;/a&gt; preach, she left the world.  One day, while meditating, the Buddha appeared before her in a ray of glory and she became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past she was a kinnarī on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and, having seen a Pacceka Buddha, worshipped him with a wreath of reeds.  Thig.  vs.  3; ThigA.  9f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is perhaps identical with Tīninalamālikā of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.515.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Punnā Therī.-(v.l.  Punnīkā)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  She was born in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika,Anāthapindika')"&gt;Anāthapindika's&lt;/a&gt; household, as the daughter of a domestic slave.  She was called Punna because, with her birth, the number of children in the household reached one hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day, on which she heard the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihanaada,Sīhanāda Sutta')"&gt;Sīhanāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; she became a sotāpanna.  She converted the brahmin &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sotthiya,Sotthiya')"&gt;Sotthiya&lt;/a&gt;, who believed in purification through water (the conversation is recorded in Thig.  vs.  236 51), and thereby won the esteem of Anāthapindika, so that he freed her.  Thereupon she entered the Order and in due course became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha she was born in a clansman's family and entered the Order.  She learned the three Pitakas and became a distinguished preacher.  She did the same under five other Buddhas - Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Konāgamana and Kassapa but, owing to her tendency to pride, she was unable to root out the defilements.  ThigA.  199 ff.; Ap.ii.611.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa, however, say of this Therī (MA.i.347f.; the story, with very different details, is given in AA.ii.716f) that she was a slave girl of Anāthapindika.  On one occasion, when the Buddha was about to set out on a tour, Anāthapindika and the other chief patrons of the Buddha, loth to lose him for several months, begged him to remain with them.  But the Buddha declined this request, and Punnā, seeing Anāthapindika very dejected and learning the reason, offered to persuade the Buddha to stay.  So she approached him and said that she would take the Three Refuges with the Five Precepts if he would postpone his tour.  The Buddha at once agreed, and Punnā was freed and adopted as Anāthapindika's daughter.  She later joined the Order, and became an arahant after listening to an admonition (Therigāthā, vs.3, about Punnā 2) of the Buddha, who appeared before her in a ray of glory.  Here we undoubtedly have a confusion of legends.  See Punnā (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be this same Punnā who is mentioned in the Milindapañha (p.115) as one of the seven people whose acts of devotion brought them recompense in this very life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Punnā&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slave girl of the brahmin soothsayer of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanachanda_jat_289,Nānacchanda Jātaka')"&gt;Nānacchanda Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  When asked what boon she desired, she answered, “A pestle and mortar and a winnowing basket." J.ii.428, 429.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Punnā&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slave woman of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  Late one night, when standing outside the house, cooling herself after having pounded a large quantity of rice, she saw &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th,Dabba Mallaputta')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt; taking some monks to their lodgings.  She thought to herself that she had to work and therefore could not sleep early, but why should monks, who are free from care, be sleepless? She concluded that one of them was sick or had been bitten by a snake.  At dawn the next day she went down to the bathing-ghat, taking a cake made of rice dust and baked over charcoal, meaning to eat it after the bath.  On the way she met the Buddha and offered him the cake, though she did not expect he would eat it.  But the Buddha, who was with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, accepted the gift and sat down to eat it, while Punnā stood watching.  When the meal was over, the Buddha asked her what she had thought of the monks, and she told him.  The Buddha pointed out to her that monks could not sleep till late for they had to be watchful and assiduous.  At the end of the discourse Punnā became a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sotaapanna,sotāpanna')"&gt;sotāpanna&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in reference to this Punnā that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kundakakucchisindhava_jat_254,Kundakasindhavapotaka Jātaka')"&gt;Kundakasindhavapotaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.  DhA.iii.321 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;.  Punnā&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slave woman.  The Commentaries mention (E.g., MA.ii.696) that the Buddha once made a rag robe (pamsukūla) out of a garment cast off by her in a cemetery overgrown with weeds (atimuttakasusāna).  When the Buddha donned the robe the earth trembled in wonder.  It was this robe that the Buddha exchanged with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;; when the Buddha picked it up from the cemetery where Punnā had cast it off it was covered with insects (SA.ii.149).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pītimalla, Pītimallaka, Pītamallaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera.  Having won the flags of three countries, he went on a visit to Ceylon and was honoured by the king.  While passing the door of the Kiñjakāsanasālā, he heard a monk reciting the "&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/n2_ny,Na tumhāka')"&gt;Na tumhāka&lt;/a&gt;" Vagga, and, touched thereby, he went to the Mahāvihāra and joined the Order.  Having learnt the two Mātikā, he went with thirty others to Gavaravāliya angana, and there practised meditation while walking up and down.  When his legs ached he walked about on his knees.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day a hunter, mistaking him for an animal, shot at him.  The dart pierced him, but he filled the wound with herbs, lay down on a slab of rock, developed insight and attained arahantship.  To the monks who gathered round him he expressed his great joy at having succeeded in his quest, and they said that had the Buddha been alive he would have stroked his head (MA.i.190).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story is given as an example of a monk striving amid great discomfort.  E.g., AA.i.29; SA.ii.216.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pindola&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pindola&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pacceka Buddha, given in a nominal list.  M.iii.69; ApA.i.106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pindola Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha explains to some monks at the Ghositārāma that Pindola Bhāradvāja had realized truth through having cultivated three controlling faculties: mindfulness, concentration, and insight.  These accomplish the destruction of birth, old age, and death.  S.v.224f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pindola Bhāradvāja&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of the chaplain of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt; of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt;.  He belonged to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja,Bhāradvājagotta')"&gt;Bhāradvājagotta&lt;/a&gt;.  He learnt the Vedas and became a successful teacher, but, finding his work distasteful, he went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  There he saw the gifts and favours bestowed on the Buddha's disciples and joined the Order.  He was very greedy, and went about with a large bowl made of dried gourd, which he kept under his bed at night and which made a scraping sound when touched; but the Buddha refused to allow him a bag for it until it should be worn down by constant contact.  Later he followed the Buddha's advice, conquered his intemperance in diet, and became an arahant.  He then announced before the Buddha his readiness to answer the questions of any doubting monks, thus uttering his "lion's roar." The Buddha declared him chief of the "lion roarers." (A.i.23; AA.i.112f.; ThagA.i.245f.; UdA.  252; SA.iii.26).  The Udāna (iv.6) contains the praise uttered by him of the Buddha, because of his perfected self mastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pindola was in the habit of taking his siesta in Udena's park at Kosambī.  (He had been king in a former birth and had spent many days in that park.) One day Udena's women, who had come to the park with him, left him asleep and crowded round Pindola to hear him preach.  Udena, noticing their absence, went in search of them, and, in his anger, ordered a nest of red ants to be put on Pindola's body.  But Pindola vanished and returned to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, where the Buddha related the Mahānāga Jātaka* and also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/guhatthaka_s,Guhatthaka Sutta')"&gt;Guhatthaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (SNA.ii.514f).  Later, (S.iv.110f.; SA.iii.26) we find Udena consulting him at the same spot and following his advice regarding the control of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* J.iv.375 ff.; SA.iii.26 says that when the king went to fetch the red ants from an asoka tree, the ants fell on him and started to sting him.  The women, under pretence of helping him, picked up the ants that fell from him and replaced them on his body, because they were angry at his rudeness to Pindola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vinaya (Vin.ii.110f.; the story is given in greater detail at DhA.iii.201ff.; see also J.iv.263) we find the Buddha rebuking Pindola for performing a cheap miracle.  The setthi of Rājagaha had placed a sandal wood bowl on a high pole and challenged any holy person to bring it down.  Pindola heard of this and, at Moggallāna's suggestion, rose in the air by magic power and brought it down.  The Buddha blamed him for using his great gifts for an unworthy end.  The bowl was given to the monks to be ground into sandal paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, Pindola had been a lion in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava,Himavā')"&gt;Himavā&lt;/a&gt;.  The Buddha visited the lion in his cave, who waited on him for seven days, paying him great honour.  Later, the lion died and was reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hamsavatii,Hamsavatī')"&gt;Hamsavatī&lt;/a&gt;, where he heard the Buddha preach and declare one of his disciples chief of the "lion roarers." Eight kappas ago he was a king named Paduma.  AA.i.111f.; Ap.i.50f.; ThagA.i.244f.; the last seems to identify him with Piyālaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna.  (ii.444).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/theragaathaa,Theragāthā')"&gt;Theragāthā&lt;/a&gt; contains two verses (vs.123 4) of Pindola, uttered by him to a former friend, to convince him that he was no longer greedy and self-seeking.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha,Milindapañha')"&gt;Milindapañha&lt;/a&gt; (pp.  398, 404) contains two other verses not traced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammapaala,Dhammapāla')"&gt;Dhammapāla&lt;/a&gt; says (UdA.252; see also SA.iii.26) that Pindola was so called because he entered the Order from love of food (pindam ulamāno pariyesamāno pabbajito ti, Pindolo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The monkey, on being questioned, said it was his nature to destroy these things; thereupon the Bodhisatta drove him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the young son of a gardener of Sāvatthi.  The owner of the garden invited the monks to his park, and there they saw the gardener picking leaves for pottles and his son tearing them up.  The monkey is identified with the boy.

It was the custom of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; to spend his siesta there after eating at the house of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaathapindika,Anāthapindika')"&gt;Anāthapindika&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.413; see also MA.i.369).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Pubbārāma, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt; erected the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/migaramatupasada,Migāramātupāsāda')"&gt;Migāramātupāsāda&lt;/a&gt;, the site costing her nine crores and the building another nine (DhA.i.413).  The Pubbārāma in Sāvatthi corresponded to the Uttammevi vihāra in Anurādhapura (UdA.158; MA.i.471).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while staying at the Pubbārāma that the Buddha sent the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt; to fetch water from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta,Anotatta')"&gt;Anotatta&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.iv.120).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vighaasa_jat_393,Vighāsa Jātaka')"&gt;Vighāsa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.310) was also preached there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pubbārāma&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon, built by Sena I.  and his consort Sanghā (Cv.l.69; see also Cv.Trs.i.144, n.  4).  Parakkamabāhu I.  is said to have restored it.  SadS.  58.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pubbārāma Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at the Pubbārāma.  The winning of insight means the destruction of the āsavas.  S.v.222.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pubbārāma Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cultivation of Ariyan insight (paññā) and Ariyan release (vimutti) leads to the destruction of the āsavas.  S.v.223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pubbārāma Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cultivation of the four indriyas (viriya, sati, samādhi and paññā) leads to the destruction of the āsavas.  S.v.224.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Pubbārāma Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same as 4 with saddhā added to the indriyas.  S.v.224.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite new fibre cloth is of an ill colour, painful to handle and of little worth; so is one of middling wear and one worn out.  Men use worn out fibre cloth for wiping cooking pots or they throw it away.  So are a novice, a monk of middle standing, or a senior monk, any of whom is immoral, of "ill colour." Their followers suffer because of them; hence they are painful to handle, and because gifts to them produce no good they are of little worth.  A.i.246 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnapāti Jātaka (No.  53)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once Treasurer of Benares, and some rogues, wishing to rob him of his money, conspired together and drugged some liquor, which they offered him as he was on his way to the palace.  The Treasurer suspected them, and promised to join them on his way back from the palace.  But on his return the vessels which contained the liquor were still quite full; he therefore charged the men with the intent to poison him, or they would have drunk some of the liquor during his absence.  They then ran away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Anāthapindika, who had a similar experience.  But in this case he was returning from the palace, and challenged the rogue's to taste their own liquor first.  J.i.268 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Putabhatta Jātaka (No.  223)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta, king of Benares, had a son whom he feared, so he sent the son away with his wife, and these two lived in a village in Kāsi.  When the king died they returned to Benares and on the way someone gave the prince a bowl of food asking share it with his wife; but he ate it all, and even when he became king and she his queen, he showed her very little honour.  The Bodhisatta, who was the king's counsellor, perceiving this, asked the queen to speak to the king about his neglect of her.  The king confessed his fault, and thereafter showed the queen great honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a landowner of Sāvatthi who once went with his wife into the country to collect a debt.  On the way back, when they were famishing, someone gave a meal to be shared by them.  But the man, deceiving his wife, sent her on ahead and ate the food himself.  The wife, on visiting the Buddha, spoke to him of this.  The two couples were identical.  J.ii.202ff.  Cp.  Godha Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puppharatta Jātaka (No.  147)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, during the Kattika Festival in Benares, the wife of a poor man insisted on having a pair of garments dyed with safflower to wear at the festival.  Urged by her desire, the husband stole at night into the king's conservatories to get the safflowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was caught by the guard and impaled alive.  He died lamenting the non fulfilment of his wife's desire and was born in hell.  The Bodhisatta was, at that time, a Spirit of the Air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a passion tossed monk who longed for the wife of his lay life.  The couple are identified with that of the story.  J.i.149f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pipphaligūhā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave near Rājagaha, evidently a favourite haunt of Mahā Kassapa.  Once when he lay there grievously ill, the Buddha visited him and cheered him by talking to him of the seven bojjhangas (S.v.79).  On another occasion, Mahā Kassapa spent several days there in a trance, and when, at the end of that period, he entered Rājagaha for alms, Sakka, with Sujātā, waited for him in the guise of a weaver, and his wife gave him a meal.  When Kassapa discovered this, he asked Sakka not to do such a thing again; but the Buddha heard Sakka's song of triumph when his meal was accepted and praised him for his gift (Ud.iii.7; UdA.195f.; DhA.i.427f.; see also Ud.i.6).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, when Kassapa was in the Pipphaliguhā, he had two novices waiting on him.  One was lazy and a liar and took the credit for the work, all of which was done by the other.  Kassapa admonished him, and he then set fire to the Elder's hut and ran away (DhA.ii.19f).  One day, as Kassapa sat in the Pipphaliguhā, he tried to contemplate the rising and falling of living beings, but the Buddha discouraged him, saying that such a task was beyond his abilities (DhA.i.258f).  The goddess Lājā (q.v.), who had been born in Tāvatimsa as a reward for a meal which she once gave to Kassapa, attempted to sweep his cell in the Pipphaliguhā and to look after it, but Kassapa rejected her services.  DhA.iii.6ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnavaddhana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Punnavaddhana.  &lt;/b&gt; Son of Migāra and husband of Visākhā (q.v.).  AA.i.220; DhA.i.387; UdA.  158, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Punnavaddhana.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the gardens laid out by Parakkamabāhu I.  in Pulatthipura (Cv.lxxix.  9).  In it was a tank, which was connected with the Toyavāpī by the Sarassatī Canal.  From this branched off, to the west, the Yamunā Canal.  Ibid., 46, 47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Punnavaddhana.  &lt;/b&gt; The name given to a kind of precious garment.  Kundalī of Dvāramandala sent several of these garments to Dīghābhaya through Sūranimila, and Dīghābhaya gave a pair himself to Sūranimila.  Mhv.xxiii.33, 37; MT.  450. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punna was probably another variation of the name.  E.g., ibid., 538.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puppha &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Puppha Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An eminent teacher of the Vinaya.  Vin.v.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Puppha.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the five horses of King Kappina, used by him in sending messages.  DhA.ii.117.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

S.iii.137 57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puppha (or Vaddha) Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Buddha declares that he upholds only that which is upheld in the world of sages (panditānam) viz., that the khandhas are impermanent, subject to woe and decay.  The Buddha has thoroughly penetrated the world condition (lokadhamma) of the world of sankhāras.  He is like a lotus, sprung from the water and come to full growth therein, yet unspotted by it.  S.iii.138f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phagguna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Phagguna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk.  In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.iv.52) he is represented as asking the Buddha if it were possible, by means of any of the senses, to recognize and proclaim the past Buddhas.  The Buddha replies in the negative.  It is probably the same monk who is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.379 ff) as having been visited during his illness by the Buddha on the suggestion of Ananda.  The Buddha found Phagguna in bed and grievously ill, and he talked to him and comforted him.  Phagguna died soon after, having attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phagguna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moliya_phagguna_th,Moliya Phagguna')"&gt;Moliya Phagguna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Phagguna Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation between the Buddha and Phagguna (1) on the possibility of recognizing, by means of the senses, the Buddhas of the past.  S.iv.  52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phagguna Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contains an account of the Buddha's visit to Phagguna (1) when the latter lay ill.  At the end of the sutta is a list of six advantages of hearing the Dhamma and of testing its goodness in time.  A.iii.379 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Phagguna Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion between the Buddha and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moliya_phagguna_th,Moliya Phagguna')"&gt;Moliya Phagguna&lt;/a&gt; as to whether anyone feeds on consciousness, exercises contact, feels, has craving, etc.  The Buddha says that the question is badly formed; all these activities are conditioned by other activities, and so on.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puttamamsa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four kinds of food material food, contact, will, and consciousness and how they should be regarded.  Material food should be eaten only to maintain existence, as parents might eat the flesh of their own son in the desert.  Contact should be regarded as a cow with a sore hide exposed always to creatures and insects who devour her.  Will should be regarded as a pit of glowing coal; and consciousness as a robber, brought before the king and smitten with darts at morning, noon, and evening.  S.ii.97 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punkonda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Damila chief, ally of Kulasekhara; he fought against Mālavacakkavatti and captured Semponmāri.  Later, he surrendered to Lankāpura and received much honour; but he then deserted Lankāpura, who had his palace burnt down.  The last we hear of him is of his alliance with Nigaladha.  Cv.lxxvi.139, 240, 273, 277, 278, 280, 299, 301; lxxvii.57, 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pottika, Pottiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a tailor and the friend of Nigrodhakumāra and Sākha-kumāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nigrodha became king, Pottika was; appointed Treasurer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their story see the Nigrodha Jātaka (No.  445).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pottika is identified with Ananda.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eldest of the five daughters of the third Okkāka, her mother being Hatthā.  She developed a skin disease, and her brothers, not wishing to be near her, took her into the forest and left her near a pond.  There she met Rāma, king of Benares, who, afflicted with a similar disease, was living in exile in the forest.  After hearing Piyā's story, he married her, and they had thirty two children, who became the ancestors of the Koliyans.  SNA.i.352f., 355f.; DA.i.258; MT.131.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnabhadda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā Niddesa (pp.  89, 92), in its explanation of vattasuddhikā, mentions, among others, Punnabhaddavattika, Vāsudevavattika, Baladevavattika and Manibhaddavattika.  Punnabhadda is, therefore, probably the name of a Yakkha like Vāsudeva and Baladeva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The N.P.D., s.v.  Punna, suggests Punnabhadda, was the father of the Yakkha Harikesa.  The Mahābhārata (i.35, 1557) gives Pūrnabhadra as the name of a serpent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Punnaka.  &lt;/b&gt; One Of the stallions of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekaraaja,Ekarāja')"&gt;Ekarāja&lt;/a&gt;.  J.vi.135.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Punnaka.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the sixteen disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/a&gt;, who visited the Buddha (SN.  vs.  1006).  His conversation with the Buddha is given in the Punnakamānavapucchā (Ibid., 1043 48).  At the end of the interview Punnaka and his one thousand followers became arahants.  SNA.ii.590.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Punnaka.  &lt;/b&gt; A Yakkha chief, nephew of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana,Vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.255).  The story of how he won the Nāga maiden&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/irandatii,Irandatī')"&gt;Irandatī&lt;/a&gt; is related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545,Vidhurapandita Jātaka')"&gt;Vidhurapandita Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  In his previous birth he had been a young man named Kaccāyana in the Anga country.  J.vi.273f.; he is also called Kātiyāna (Kaccāna).  He is also referred to as Punnakaraja (J.iv.182).  He is evidently identical with the Yakkha chieftain mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aataanaatiya_s,Ātānitiya Sutta')"&gt;Ātānitiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.204) among those to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in times of tribulation.  The gem used by Punnaka as a stake in his gambling with Koravya was such that all things in the world could be seen in it (MT.  552).  The shout of victory uttered by Punnaka when he defeated Koravya was one of the four shouts heard throughout &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;.  SNA.i.223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Punnaka.  &lt;/b&gt; A king of twenty five kappas ago, a former birth of Asanabodhiya Thera.  Ap.i.111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Punnaka.  &lt;/b&gt; Punnaka was evidently not a name of high station.  E.g., J.vi.273.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Punnaka.&lt;/b&gt; See also s.v.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punna,Punna')"&gt;Punna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Punnaka Jātaka.&lt;/b&gt; Another name for the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vidhurapandita_jat_545,Vidhurapandita Jātaka')"&gt;Vidhurapandita Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Puggala Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Seven kinds of persons who are worthy of gifts and homage.  A.iv.10f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Puggala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Nine kinds of persons who exist in the world: those who have attained the Four Fruits of the Path, these who are on the way thereto, and putthijjanas.  A.iv.372.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Puggala Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Preached at Sāvatthi, to Pasenadi, on the four kinds of persons: those that are joined to darkness and fare to light, those that are joined to darkness and fare to darkness, those that are joined to light and fare to darkness, those that are joined to light and fare to light.  S.i.93ff.; cp.  D.iii.233; A.ii.85; Pugg.iv.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Puggala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Incalculable is the beginning of samsāra.  The bones of a single person faring on for an aeon, if collected, would be a pile as great as Vepulla.  S.ii.185.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puggala Vagga.&lt;/b&gt; Several sections of the Anguttara Nikāya are called by this name: the sixth of the Duka Nipāta (A.i.76-80), the third of the Tika (A.i.118-31), the fourteenth of the Catukka (ii.133-39), the sixteenth of the Dasaka (v.  247-49), and the twentieth of the Dasaka (v.  281-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pūtigatta Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young man of Sāvatthi, of good family.  After he joined the Order an eruption broke out on him which covered his whole body with sores.  His fellow monks, unable to look after him, abandoned him.  When the Buddha discovered this, he boiled some water and washed Tissa with his own hands and cleaned and dried his garments.  When Tissa felt comforted the Buddha preached to him, and Tissa became an arahant.  In a past birth he had been a fowler and had killed many birds, of which he sometimes first broke the bones to prevent them from flying away.  One day he had given alms to an arahant.

Phala Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same as (1), only substituting the four iddhipādas for the five indriyas.  S.v.285f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Phala Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On seven fruits to be obtained from the cultivation of the four iddhipādas.  S.v.285.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potaliputta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paribbājaka who visited Samiddhi at the Vejuvana in Rājagaha and said that he had heard the Buddha declare that all action and speech were vain, and that what passed in the mind was the only thing of importance.  A stage could be reached in which there was no feeling whatever.  Samiddhi protested that Potaliputta misinterpreted the Buddha's teaching, and Potaliputta then asked him questions regarding experience, which Samiddhi answered.  Potaliputta, showing neither approval nor disapproval, walked away.  When the Buddha heard from Ananda of Potaliputta's questions and Samiddhi's answers he blamed Samiddhi for his hasty reply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For details see Mahākammavibhanga Sutta.

When the king's officials came to find the robber, he had disappeared, and they went away.  Nearby was a bodhi tree whose sprite was Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Moggallāna, who saw a man lurking near his cell, and, feeling suspicious, drove him away.

He erected and endowed the Mātambiyapadhānaghara, and built houses in the Kuppurā parivepa, the Kurundapillaka vihāra and the Mahārājaghara.  Whem the king died, he administered the kingdom, threw the sub king Dāthāsiva into prison and set Datta of Dhanapitthi on the throne.  When Datta died, Potthakuttha had Hatthadātha crowned king.  Later, when Mānavamma rebelled against him, he ate poisoned food, provided by his friend, the chief of Merukandara, and died.  Cv.xlvi.19, 39, 44; xlvii.55, 61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Sāriputta visits the Buddha and tells him that most of his time is spent aloof.

It deals with the question of trances and of the soul, and also with the infinity and eternalism of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is significant as containing a list of the topics which Paribbājakas appear to have discussed at their meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pukkusa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A counsellor of Maddava, king of Benares.  For details see the Dasannaka Jātaka.  Pukkusa is identified with Sāriputta.  J.iii.341.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four ministers of Vedeha, king of Mithilā.  He joined with his three companions in a conspiracy against Mahosadha, stealing a golden necklace from the king's palace in order to try and implicate Mahosadha.  The details are given in the Mahāummagga Jātaka (J.vi.330ff).  On Pukkusa's thigh was a leprous spot, which he hid from the king because the king loved to lay his head on Pukkusa's lap.  Only his younger brother knew of this secret; but it was discovered later by Mahosadha, and Pukkusa was sent to prison.  Pukkusa is identified with Potthāpāda.  Ibid., 478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mallarājaputta.  He was a disciple of Alāra Kālama, and one day, while on his way from Kusinārā to Pāvā, he saw the Buddha seated under a tree by the roadside and stayed to talk to him.  He mentioned that once five hundred carts had passed by where Ālāra sat, and yet so deep was he in meditation that he had failed to notice them.  The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration.  Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha's suggestion, he handed to Ananda.  When Pukkusa had left, Ananda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha's body (D.ii.130ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.569) that Pukkusa was a merchant, and was the owner of the five hundred carts which had crossed the Kakkutthā (q.v.) shortly before the incident above mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Pukkusa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a caste, classified among the despised castes (E.g., A.ii.85; M.ii.152).  The Commentary explains (E.g., AA.ii.523) them as "those who sweep up flowers which are offered at shrines and are not removed by the devotees who have given them." The word Pukkusa was evidently not despised as a personal name because, in the case of Pukkusa (3), for instance, the person bearing the name was a khattiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phaladāyaka vimāna Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a gardener of Bimbisāra.  The king expressed a desire to eat mangoes out of season, and the gardener, having promised to satisfy this desire, worked very hard and succeeded in making one of the trees bear four fruits.  While on his way to the palace with these fruits, he saw Moggallāna and gave them to him, prepared to bear the king's wrath.  Moggallāna gave the fruits to the Buddha, who gave one each to Sāriputta, Mahā Kassapa and Moggallāna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bimbisāra heard of what his gardener had done he was greatly pleased, and granted him a village and made him other presents.  After death the gardener was born in Tāvatimsa, where he met Moggallāna.  Vv.  vi.  3; VvA.288ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnamā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was staying in the Migārāmātupāsāda, a certain monk asked him a series of questions regarding the five upādānakkhandhā their origin and nature, their definitions, the cause of their arising, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha answered his questions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the sutta is an explanation of attā.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pinguttara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lad of Mithilā who studied in Takkasilā and was given in marriage his teacher's beautiful daughter.  But he was unlucky and intensely disliked his wife, avoiding her whenever possible.  On the way to Mithilā, when his wife climbed up a fig tree in order to assuage her hunger, he put thorns round the tree and left her there.  King Videha of Mithilā rescued her and married her, naming her Udumbarā.  Some time later she saw Pinguttara mending the road, and smiled at her own good fortune.  The king was ready to kill her out of jealousy, but Mahosadha saved her life.  J.vi.347f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pilinda Vaccha, Pilindi Vaccha, Pilindiya Vaccha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a brahmin of Sāvatthi, born before the Buddha's Enlightenment.  Pilinda was his personal name, Vaccha being that of his family.  He became a recluse and learnt the Cūla Gandhāra vijjā, but, when the Buddha appeared, the charm refused to work.  Having heard that the Mahā Gandhāra prevented the working of the Cūla Gandhāra and having concluded that the Buddha knew the former, he entered the Order at the Buddha's suggestion, in order to acquire it.  The Buddha gave him exercises in meditation, and he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda's guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening.  He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks (A.i.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a rich householder of Hamsavatī and wished to become a monk beloved of the devas.  In the time of Sumedhā Buddha be was born in the world of men and paid great honour to the Buddha's Thūpa.  In a later existence he was a cakkavatti, named Varuna, and established his subjects in righteousness, so that after death they were born in heaven (ThagA.i.51f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as Vasala (outcaste).  When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalavādī-Brahmins (Ud.iii.6; DhA.iv.181f).  One day, on entering Rājagaha, Pilinda met a man carrying a bowl of pipphalī (long pepper).  “What's in thy bowl, Vasala?" he asked, and the man, in anger, said, “The dung of mice." "So be it," said Pilinda, and the pepper turned into dung.  The man was horrified, and, seeking Pilinda, persuaded him to right the matter (AA.i.154f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya Pitaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies.  Vin.i.204f.; some hold (e.g., Brethren 14, n.  4) that the Thera of Rājagaha, mentioned in the following stories, was distinct from the Thera of Sāvatthi.  See below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Bimbisāra found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself.  The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha's sanction.  The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later.  On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma.  One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any.  Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold.  The king's officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison.  The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his iddhi powers by turning the whole palace into gold.  The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them.  Vin.i.206 ff.; iii.248ff.  This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.  It was in reference to this that the Gandhāra Jātaka (J.iii.363 ff.) was preached.  The incident of the palace being turned into gold is referred to at Kvu.608.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another story is related of Pilinda's iddhi powers (Vin.iii.67).  Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped.  Pilinda, by his iddhi power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done.  The Apadāna (i.59f.; 302 16) has two sets of verses ascribed to Pilinda, the second very much longer than the first, thus supporting the view mentioned earlier, that there were two Theras named Pilindavaccha.  In any event, there has evidently been a confusion of legends, and it is no longer possible to separate them.  It is the first set of Apadāna verses which is quoted in the Theragāthā Commentary (Loc.  cit.).  In the second set we are told that in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Pilinda was a very wealthy dovārika.  He took many precious gifts to Ananda, Padumuttara's father, and won from him a boon.  He asked, as his boon, that he should be allowed to entertain the Buddha.  The king refused to grant this, but the dovārika appealed to the judges and they gave the verdict in his favour.  Thereupon he held a great almsgiving of unparalleled splendour for seven days and gave away all manner of gifts.  As a result he was born one thousand times as king of the devas and one thousand times also as king of men.  In his last birth he suffered from neither heat nor cold, dust did not adhere to his body, and the rain did not wet him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puradeva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A god, evidently the tutelary deity of Anurādhapura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a shrine erected to him within the precincts of the Mahāvihāra.  Near this shrine a battle took place between Dutthagāmanī and Bhalluka.  Kandula considered it a lucky spot and led Dutthagāmanī's forces up to it (Mhv.xxv.  87).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shrine was to the north of the Mahāsusāna.  MT.  486.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potthapāda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Potthapāda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paribbājaka.  A discussion between him and the Buddha on trance and on the soul, which took place in Mallikārāma in Sāvatthi, is reported in the Potthapāda Sutta.  Potthapāda, accepting the Buddha's views, was jeered at by his companions for doing so.  Two or three days later he again visited the Buddha with Citta Hatthisāriputta (q.v.), when the Buddha continued the earlier discussion on personality and the soul.  At the end of the discourse Potthapāda became the Buddha's follower (D.i.178ff).  Potthapāda is identified with Pukkusa of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka.  J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Potthapāda&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as a parrot.  For his story see the Rādha Jātaka (1).  J.i.495f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.

Potthapāda Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past he was born as Sunetta, son of King Kitava, and because he insulted a Pacceka Buddha he was reborn in Avīci.  Later he was born in a family of fishermen near Kundinagara, but, remembering his past lives, he refused to take part in any fishing.  His parents therefore cast him out, but Ananda, finding him starving, gave him food, and, at the Buddha's suggestion, ordained him.  He soon became an arahant and dwelt with twelve others in Sānavāsipabbata.  Potthapāda's kinsmen became petas, and his parents sent to him a brother, of whom Potthapāda was specially fond, to plead for his intervention.  He therefore begged alms, and offered them to his colleagues in the name of his kinsmen, who thus regained happiness.  Pv.iii.2; PvA.177 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pubbakotthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha, while staying at Pubbakotthaka in Sāvatthi, asks Sāriputta if he believes that the five indriyas (of saddhā, etc.) if cultivated, lead to Deathlessness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta answers that he not only believes it, but has actually realized and understood it by insight.

Once, in the past, he was a Jatila named Nārada, with fourteen thousand followers, living near the rock called Samanga.  He erected, on the bank of the Amarikā, a thūpa of sand as an object of worship for himself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his last birth he was of parents who were devout followers of the Buddha and worshipped at a shrine erected in the Buddha's name.  When the boy was seven years old he saw the shrine and, recalling his past, became an arahant (Ap.ii.437 ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is perhaps to be identified with Vasabha Thera (q.v.).

Wishing to rouse him to exert himself, the Buddha constantly referred to him as "Tuccha-Pothila." Pothila took the hint, and, travelling one hundred and twenty leagues, arrived at a forest hermitage where lived thirty monks.  He asked their leader to help him, but he referred him to a junior monk, who, in his turn, referred him on, and so on, until at last he was forced to apply to the seven year old novice who sat doing needlework.  With his pride humbled, Pothila asked him for advice.  In order to test him, the novice asked him to jump into a pool with his robes on.  This Pothila did, and the novice, satisfied as to his earnestness taught him how, in the case of an anthill with six holes into which a lizard entered, anyone, wishing to capture the lizard, would close up five of the holes.  So with the six doors of the senses; close five doors, and concentrate on the door of the mind.  At the end of the discourse, the Buddha appeared before Pothila in a ray of light and Pothila became an arahant (DhA.iii.417-21).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses, addressed to him by Moggallāna, are given in the Theragāthā (Vs.  1174-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was of Ceylon, and crossed over to India, where he studied under Yonaka Dhammarakkhita.  On his way home by sea he felt doubtful of one word, and returned all the way, one hundred leagues, to consult his teacher.  On the way from the port he mentioned the word to a householder, who was so pleased with him that he gave him a blanket and one hundred thousand.  This blanket Tissa gave to his teacher, but the latter cut it up and used it as a spread, as an example to others (not to desire luxuries).  Tissa had his doubts set at rest and returned to Jambukola.  There, at the Vālīkāvāma, as he was sweeping the courtyard of the cetiya, other monks asked him questions in order to vex him.  But he was able to answer all these, having attained the patisambhidā.  VibhA.  389.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Purāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Purāna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk who lived in Dakkhināgiri.  It is said that when he visited Rājagaha after the holding of the First Council, he was asked to give his approval to the "findings" of the same.  His answer was that he preferred to remember what he himself had heard and learnt from the Buddha.  Vin.ii.189f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Purāna&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chamberlain (thapati ? equerry) of Pasenadi.  He was the brother of Isidatta and the father of Migasālā.  In his later years he lived the life of a celibate and was reborn in Tusita as a sakadāgāmī.  A.iii.348 ff.;v.138 ff.  The SA (iii.215), however, says that Purāna was a sotāpanna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conversation he had with the Buddha, in the company of Isidatta, at Sādhuka (q.v.), is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.349 ff).  In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123) Pasenadi speaks of the great loyalty of these two men towards the Buddha.  After discussing the Doctrine till late at night, they would sleep with their heads towards the spot where the Buddha was staying and their feet towards the king.  Purāna is mentioned (E.g., A.iii.451) as an ideal layman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treasurer (Kosārakkha) of King Munda.  When Munda abandoned himself to grief at the death of his wife Bhaddā, Piyaka arranged for him to visit Nārada at the Kukkutārāma.  After the visit, Munda was consoled and ordered Piyaka to build a thūpa for Bhaddā's remains.  A.iii.57 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pesakāradhītuvatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a weaver's daughter of Ālavi.  She heard the Buddha preach at the Aggālava cetiya on the necessity of meditating constantly on the inevitable ness of death and, though she was only sixteen, she was the only one to profit by the sermon.  Three years later the Buddha again visited Ālavi.  The citizens entertained him, but the Buddha would not preach his thanksgiving sermon till the weaver's daughter, having finished the tasks required of her by her father, was able to be present.  On her arrival the Buddha asked her questions so that her wisdom might be known to the assembled populace, and, at the conclusion of the Buddha's discourse, she became a sotāpanna.  That same day she was killed by an accident to her loom, and her father joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course.  DhA.iii.170 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnaka(mānava) pucchā (or pañha)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions asked by Punnaka, pupil of Bāvarī (q.v.), and the Buddha's answers thereto.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who make sacrifices and exert themselves for gain of pleasure and praise do not succeed in escaping birth and decay.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the calm and the free can so escape.  SN.vs.1043 48. They are explained in CNid.11ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions are referred to at A.i.133.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnamāsa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Punnamāsa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Sāvatthi as the son of a brahmin, named Samiddhi; he was called Punnamāsa because, on the day of his birth, all the empty vessels in the house were filled with golden pennies.  He left the world after a son had been born to him, and, having entered the Order under the Buddha, took the formula of the five impurities (tacapañcaka) as topic of meditation and became an arahant.  His former wife adorned herself and came with her child, seeking to seduce him, but without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a partridge (cakkavāka), and, pleased with the appearance of the Buddha, offered him a sāla flower, holding it in his beak.  Seventeen kappas ago he became king eight times under the name of Sucārudassana (Thag.  vs.  10; ThagA.i.53f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Paccāgamanīya of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Punnamāsa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born at Sāvatthi in a landowner's family.  He was named Punnamāsa because, on the day of his birth, all the empty vessels in the house became filled with gold and silver coins.  He left the world after the birth of a son, and, dwelling near the village, put forth effort, till he became an arahant.  Then going to Sāvatthi, he paid homage to the Buddha and dwelt in a charnel field.  Meanwhile his son died, and his wife, wishing to prevent the king from taking the property, which was now left without an heir, went, with a large company, to her husband in order to persuade him to return to the lay life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Tissa Buddha he was wandering about the forest, bow in hand, when he saw the Buddha's robe hanging on a branch outside his cell.  He immediately threw away his bow and, recalling the Buddha's virtues, paid homage to the robe.  Thag.vs.171, 172; ThagA.i.297f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Pamsukūlasaññika of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.418f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Piya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk who is virtuous, learned, lovely in speech, who cultivates the four jhānas and possesses emancipation in mind and through insight - such a monk is pious and pleasing in brahmacariyā.  A.iii.262.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Piya Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Pasenadi visits the Buddha and tells him of certain thoughts which had arisen in his mind regarding self.  Those whose conduct in deed, word, and thought is evil, for them the self is a hateful enemy, because that which one enemy would do to another, that they do to the self.  For those whose conduct is virtuous, the self is a dear friend.  The Buddha approves of the king's exposition.  S.i.71f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Piya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; On seven qualities which make a monk beloved of his fellows.  A.iv.1f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Piya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Seven other similar qualities.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punabbasumātā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yakkhinī, mother of Punabbasu.  One evening towards sunset, when the Buddha was at Jetavana, she, with her daughter Uttarā on her hip and the boy's hand in hers, came to the grove in search of food.  She saw the silent monks seated round the Buddha while he preached, and having hushed her babe to silence she and Punabbasu listened to the Buddha.  At the end of the sermon, both mother and son became sotāpannas, Uttarā being too young to understand (S.i.210f.; SA.i.239f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punabbasumātā is quoted as an example of a Yakkhinī who could travel through the air (PSA.79).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was a vemānikapeta.  DA.ii.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnamukha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Punnamukha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the merchants (setthi) of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/ekaraaja,Ekarāja')"&gt;Ekarāja&lt;/a&gt;, whom he proposed, at the suggestion of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/khandahaala_jat_542,Khandahāla')"&gt;Khandahāla&lt;/a&gt;, to sacrifice for his own welfare.  J.vi.135.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Punnamukha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A royal cuckoo (phussakokila).  For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kunaala_jat_536,Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phāsu Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Phāsu Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five abodes of comfort: the four jhānas and final emancipation of mind through insight.  A.iii.119.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phāsu Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five comfortable abodes: living in amity with one's fellows in act of deed, in act of word, in act of mind, maintaining whole and unbroken the virtues, praised by the wise and living in accordance with the Ariyan view.  A.iii.132; cf.  D.ii.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyañjaha Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to the family of a Licchavi nobleman of Vesāli and, when he grew up, his chief interest was war, hence his name ("ever destroying what is dear to his enemies").  When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Piyañjaha found faith in him, joined the Order and became an arahant, dwelling in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he had been a tree sprite, and, standing on the edge of a concourse of devas because his influence was small, he had heard the Buddha preach.  One day seeing a bank of pure sand by a beautiful river, he reflected that the Buddha's virtues were more numerous than even the grains of sand.  Seventy three kappas ago he was a king named Pulinapupphiya.  Thag.vs.76; ThagA.i.168f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Ñānasaññaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.161.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pupphathūpiya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a brahmin ascetic on Kukkurapabbata with a large number of disciples.  Hearing of the Buddha's appearance in the world, he wished to visit him, but fell ill on the way.  He thereupon erected a thūpa of flowers in the Buddha's name and died soon after.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty four kappas ago he was king sixteen times under the name of Aggisama, and thirty-eight times under that of Ghatāsana.  Ap.i.155f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phussa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Phussa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighteenth of the twenty four Buddhas.  He was born in the Sirimāuyyāna in Kāsi, his father being the khattiya Jayasena and his mother Sirimā.  AA.  (i.  144) says that his father was Mahinda and that he had three stepbrothers.  One of them was Uruvela Kassapa (i.  165) in this birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived for six thousand years in three palaces: Garula, Hamsa and Suvannabhara.  His wife was Kisāgotamī and his son Ananda (or Anūpama).  His body was fifty eight cubits high.  He left the world riding an elephant, and practised austerities for six months.  A setthi's daughter, Sirivaddhā, gave him milk rice, while an ascetic, named Sirivaddha, gave him grass for his seat, under an āmanda (or āmalaka )tree.  His chief disciples were Sukhita (or Surakkhita) and Dhammasena among men and Cālā (or Sālā) and Upacālā (Upasālā) among women.  His personal attendant was Sambhiya.  Dhanañjaya and Visākha among men, and Padumā and Nāgā among women, were his chief lay patrons.  The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Vijitāvī of Arimanda.  The Buddha lived for ninety thousand years and died at the Sonārāma (Setārāma) in Kusinārā.  His relies were scattered (Bu.xix.1ff.; BuA.192f.; PvA.19f).  Ambapālī was his sister.  Ap.ii.  613.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phussa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a ruler of a province and was trained in all accomplishments.  Having heard a great Thera preach, he left the world and joined the Order.  He practised jhāna and became an arahant.  One day an ascetic named Pandarassagotta heard him preach and questioned him on the future progress of Bhikkhus.  Phussa's reply is contained in the Theragāthā, vs.  949 80; ThagA.ii.82f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Punnovāda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punna (of Sunāparanta) visits the Buddha and asks him for a teaching that he may follow it and be purged of self.  The Buddha tells him to avoid finding delight in the pleasures of the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On learning that Punna proposes to live in Sunāparanta, the Buddha warns him that the people of that part are fierce and violent.  Punna declares that even should they kill him, he would not bear them ill will, but would rejoice to be of use to them.  He leaves for Sunāparanta, with the Buddha's approval, and there gather around him five hundred disciples of either sex who have won arahantship.  After Punna's death, the monks question the Buddha about him, and the Buddha tells them that he had realised nibbāna.  M.iii.267 ff.; S.iv.60 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pindolya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha retires for his siesta to the Mahāvana, near Kapilavatthu, and the thought occurs to him that he should admonish the monks and look after them tenderly as some of them had only lately joined the Order.  Sahampatī appears before him and confirms his intention.  The Buddha thereupon goes to the Nigrodhārāma, makes the monks come to him in ones and twos, and talks to them.  The life of a recluse is the meanest of callings to be called a "scrap gatherer." It is entered on by householders solely as a means of escaping from woe.  The man who leaves the world and who yet does not fulfil the life of a recluse, is like a faggot from a funeral pyre, burnt at both ends and smeared with filth.  Therefore should the monks shun thoughts of lust, ill will and hurt, and practise the four satipatthānas.  Thus will they obtain release.  S.iii.91ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piyangudīpa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An island, probably near Ceylon, the monks of which enjoyed a reputation for extreme holiness.  When Dutthagāmanī, fleeing from Cūlanganiyapitthi, wished to give alms though having so little food, an arahant Thera came from Piyangudīpa to accept it as soon as the time of the almsgiving was announced by the minister Tissa (Mhv.xxiv.24ff).  Again, when Dutthagāmanī, after his conquest of the Damilas, was filled with remorse for his slaughter of men, arahants of Piyangudīpa read his thoughts and came to console him (Mhv.xxv.104ff).  Mention is made of as many as twelve thousand monks living on Piyangudīpa.  Mhv.xxxii.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pessa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elephant trainer of Campā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visited the Buddha at Gaggarāpokkharanī where Kandaraka was also present, and his conversation on that occasion is recorded in the Kandaraka Sutta.  When Pessa had left, the Buddha is reported to have said that he was a man of great understanding, and that had he stayed longer he could have taken away with him something which would have proved precious to him.  M.i.339 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phandana Jātaka (No.  475)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lion acquired the habit of going to lie under a phandana tree, but one day a branch fell on his shoulder and hurt him.  The lion thereupon conceived an enmity against the tree, and when a carpenter came in search of wood for a cartwheel, suggested to him that he should cut down that very tree as the wood would be excellent for his purpose.  The deity of the tree, discovering this, appeared before the carpenter and told him that if he placed four inches of the hide of a lion on the rim of his wheel its value would be greatly enhanced.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The carpenter, adopting both suggestions, killed the lion and cut down the tree (J.iv.207ff).  This was one of the stories related by the Buddha in the course of the quarrel between the Sākiyans and the Koliyans.  SNA.i.358.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potaliya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Potaliya Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion between the householder Potaliya and the Buddha as to what constitutes true retirement from household life.  The Buddha shows, by means of various similes, that the pleasures; of the senses are unsatisfying and dangerous, and should be avoided.  Such renunciation brings higher knowledge.  M.i.359 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Potaliya Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells the Paribbājaka Potaliya, who visits him, of four kinds of persons found in the world: those who praise and dispraise rightly and seasonably, and those who praise and dispraise wrongly and unseasonably.  A.ii.100ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pilotika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pilotika&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paribbājaka.  Jānussoni once met him returning from Jetavana, where he had gone early to wait on the Buddha.  Pilotika, on being questioned, spoke very highly of the Buddha.  It is this conversation which, on its being repeated by Jānussoni to the Buddha, led to the preaching of the Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (M.i.175 ff).  Jānussoni addresses Pilotika as Vacchāyana, which, according to the Commentary, (MA.i.393) was the name of his clan.  From the same source we gather that the Paribbājaka's own name was Pilotikā; he was young, of a golden colour, and loved ministering to the Buddha and the Buddha's eminent disciples.  He is spoken of, together with Sabhiya (SA.ii.188), as a wise Paribbājaka.  Pilotika is identified with Devinda of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka.  J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pilotika Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda once saw a poor youth going along in a ragged garment, a potsherd in his hand.  Ananda took him to the monastery and ordained him.  The youth hung his garment and the potsherd on the branch of a tree and practised meditation.  After a time he became fat and discontented and wished to return to the lay life.  But on noticing his rag and his potsherd, he realized his folly and, admonishing himself, returned to his meditation.  Three times the same thing happened, but in the end he became an arahant.  He used to speak of the rag as his "teacher." DhA.iii.84f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pokkharasāti, Pokkharasādi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mahāsāla brahmin of great wealth and learning who lived in Ukkatthā, on a royal demesne given by Pasenadi.  Ambattha was the pupil of Pokkharasāti, who sent him to the Buddha at Icchānangala to discover if the report of the Buddha's greatness were true.  When Pokkharasāti heard later that Ambattha had been rude to the Buddha, he sought the Buddha by night and begged for his forgiveness.  The next day he invited the Buddha to a meal, and having listened to his teaching, declared himself his follower and became a sotāpanna (D.i.87f., 106ff).  Owing to his eminence, he was present at the meetings of the brahmins held in Manasākata (D.i.235) and Icchānangala (SN.p.115).  Vasettha, of the Vāsettha Sutta, was also his pupil (SN.vs.594).  In the Subha Sutta (M.ii.200ff)*, Subha Todeyyaputta, another disciple, is reported to have said that Pokkharasāti - here described as Opamañña (of the Upamañña clan) and lord of Subhagavana (Subhapvanika) treated as empty boasts the claims of brahmins and recluses to transcend ordinary human bonds and rise to the height of Ariyan knowledge.  This evidently refers to a time prior to his conversion.  The same Sutta mentions a slave girl of Pokkharasāti, Punnikā by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* the Vimānavatthu gives the name of another of his disciples, Chattamānava (q.v.), who was killed while bringing presents to his teacher.  (Vv.v.3; VvA.229ff.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (DA.i.244f.; MA.ii.804; SNA.462) dwell at length on Pokkharasāti's attractive personality.  His body was of the color of the white lotus, like a silver pandal in heaven, his hair the color of sapphire, his eyes like blue lotus, etc.  He evidently was of true regal appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin versed in the three Vedas who, having heard the doctrine and given alms, was reborn in the deva world.  Thereafter, scorning birth in the womb of a woman, he sprang to life in a lotus, which grew in a pond in Himāva.  An ascetic saw the lotus, adopted the boy, and taught him the Vedas.  The king was pleased with his great learning, and gave him Ukkatthā as a mark of great favor.  The name of Pokkharasāti was given to him owing to his birth in a lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Divyāvadāna (p.  616 ff., 620) calls him Puskarasārī, and tells a story of his daughter Prakrti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety two kappas ago he was an ascetic in Himavā, and gave a handful of fruit to Phussa Buddha.  Ap.i.130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic well versed in the Vedas who, seeing the Buddha, gave him a pundarīka fruit.  One hundred and seven kappas ago he was a king named Sumangala (Ap.i.160f).  He is probably identical with Susārada Thera.  ThagA.i.167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Also called Piyālaphaladāyaka.  In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a pigeon who gave to the Buddha a piyāla fruit.  Fifteen kappas ago he was a king called Mālabhi (Ap.i.169f).  He is probably identical with Devasabha.  ThagA.i.187f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety four kappas ago Siddhattha Buddha came to him for alms after having arisen from samādhi, and he gave the Buddha various fruits.  Fifty seven kappas ago he was a king named Ekajjha.  Ap.i.239.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Phaladāyaka Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was an ascetic living on the banks of the Bhāgīrathī and gave to the Buddha all the fruits he had gathered for his own meal.  Ap.i.250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

J.ii.155f.; J.iii.3; see also VvA.259. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was probably near the residence of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvārī')"&gt;Bāvārī&lt;/a&gt; (see SNA.ii.581).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pindapātadāyaka Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the four names given to Vanavāsī Tissa (that being the last), because, when he came to Sāvatthi, the citizens vied with one another to do him honour, and in two days he was given one thousand bowls of alms and one thousand garments, all of which he gave to the Order.  This was due to his having given in a previous birth a piece of cloth to an Elder.  DhA.ii.88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pingiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pingiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaplain to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmadatta,Brahmadatta')"&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares.  He was a former birth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.161).  His story is given in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhonasaakha_jat_353,Dhonasākha Jātaka')"&gt;Dhonasākha Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pingiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called Pingiya mānava, nephew and pupil of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/a&gt;.  At the time that he visited the Buddha with the other disciples he was 120 years old and very feeble.  At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, as recorded in the Pingiya Sutta (SN.  vs.  1120 23), because of his feebleness, he failed to reach any attainment.  Thereupon he praised the Buddha and begged of him to go on.  The Buddha preached to him further, and he became an anāgāmī, failing, however, to attain arahantship because his mind wandered to his maternal uncle, Bāvarī.  His one thousand pupils, however, became arahants.  Later, with the Buddha's leave, he visited Bāvarī and told him the glad tidings, describing the Buddha's glory (SN.vs.1131 45).  At the end of his statement, the Buddha, seeing that the minds of both of them were mature, sent forth a ray of light from Sāvatthi and, appearing before them, preached to them.  Thereupon Bāvarī became an anāgāmī and Pingiya an arahant (SNA.ii.603ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pingiya was called mānava, even at the age of 120. (SNA.ii.413).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Pingiya&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven anāgamīns born in the Avihā world, in the company of Ghatīkārā (S.i.35, 60).  He is described as a bhikkhū, and is therefore probably identical with Pingiya (2).  The story of the latter having attained arahantship must, in that case, have been a later legend.  It is also possible that Pingiya is a variant reading for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiyani,Pingiyānī')"&gt;Pingiyānī&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.

One day, having gone to Benares for salt and vinegar, he entered the city for alms and went to the house of a merchant with a reputation for piety.  But the merchant was away at the court, and as the ascetic saw no one in the house, he turned and went away.  On the way he was met by the merchant, who apologised for his absence and invited him to return to his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a monk, who, on joining the Order, inquired who looked after the monks.  On being told that Anāthapindika and Visakhā did so, he went to their houses very early the next day.  It was so early that no one attended to him.  When he returned later it was too late and the food had all gone.  Thereupon he started abusing the two families.  J.iii.118 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

While his mother, with him on her hip, was seeking for food at night, she came unexpectedly to Jetavana where Anuruddha was reciting some verses.  The sound pleased her and she stood "smitten to the marrow, like a post," hushing to sleep her child who was whimpering for food.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pūrana Kassapa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the six well known teachers, contemporaneous with the Buddha.  He is said to have taught the doctrine of non-action (akiriya), denying the result of good or bad actions (D.i.52 f); probably the more correct description of Kassapa's teaching would be niskriyavāda - i.e., an affirmation that the soul is passive, unaffected by the good or the bad done by us, the ultimate reality lying beyond good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere (S.iii.69; v.126), however, he is mentioned as an ahetuvādin, denying hetupaccaya (condition and cause - i.e., the efficacy of kamma), which teaching, in the Sāmmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.53; see also A.iii.383, where the teaching of Chalabhijātiyo is also attributed to Pūrana), is attributed to Makkhali Gosāla.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.142; he could not have been a slave.  Kassapa is a brahmin gotta.  The SNA (372) calls him an ājīvaka) that Pūrana Kassapa came by his name from the fact that as a result of his birth the number of slaves in a certain household reached one hundred.  Owing to this fact he was never found fault with, even when he failed to do his work satisfactorily.  But, in spite of this, he was dissatisfied and fled from his masters.  He then had his clothes stolen by thieves and went about naked.  His gotta name was Kassapa.  He had a following of five hundred, among whom was the deva putta Asama (S.i.65, see also Ajātasattu).  He was consulted by the Licchavis Abhaya (S.v.126) and Mahāli (S.iii.68) and by the wanderer Vacchagotta (S.iv.398).  He claimed to be omniscient.  (A.iv.428; here we probably have a more correct explanation of his name, Pūrana i.e., in his claim to have attained perfect wisdom, pūranañānna).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.208)* states that when the heretics were unable to prevent the Buddha from performing the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba, they fled discomfited.  Pūrana Kassapa was among them, and in the course of his flight, he came across one of his followers, a farmer, who was on his way to see him, carrying a vessel of broth and a rope.  Pūrana took the vessel and the rope, and going to the banks of the river near Sāvatthi, tied the vessel round his neck and threw himself into the stream.  There was a circle of bubbles on the water and Pūrana was reborn in Avīci.  The Milindapañha (p.  4 f) also mentions a Pūrana Kassapa, contemporary with Milinda.  This perhaps refers to a teacher descended from the same school who is credited with the view that the earth rules or sustains the world.  v.l.  Purāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* For a different version see Rockhill: op.  cit., 80. According to this legend, Kassapa must have died in the sixteenth year of the Buddha's ministry.  This is hardly reconcilable with the statement that Ajātasattu consulted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pukkusāti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young monk whom the Buddha met at the house of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggava,Bhaggava')"&gt;Bhaggava&lt;/a&gt;, the potter, in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  Pukkusāti was already occupying the guest room of the house, and the Buddha asked to be allowed to share it, to which Pukkusāti readily agreed.  They sat together for sometime in silence, and then the Buddha preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhaatuvibhanga,Dhātuvibhanga Sutta')"&gt;Dhātuvibhanga Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.  Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha at the end of the sermon and begged his forgiveness for not having paid him due honour; he then begged to have the upasampadā conferred on him.  The Buddha consented and sent him to procure a begging bowl and a robe.  On the way Pukkusāti was gored to death by a mad cow.  When this was reported to the Buddha, he said that Pukkusāti was an &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/anagami,Anāgāmin')"&gt;Anāgāmin&lt;/a&gt; and had been born in the realms above, never more to return.  M.iii.237 47. In this context Pukkusāti is spoken of as a kulaputta (iii.238); see also J.iv.180 and DhA.ii.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his comments on the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta, Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Pukkusāti.  MA.ii.979 ff.  Cp.  the story of Tissa, king of Roruva (ThagA.i.199f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;, contemporary of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt; and of about the same age.  A friendly alliance was established between the two kings through the medium of merchants who travelled between the two countries for purposes of trade.  In the course of time, although the two kings had never seen each other, there grew up between them a deep bond of affection.  Pukkusāti once sent to Bimbisāra, as a gift, eight priceless garments in lacquered caskets.  This gift was accepted at a special meeting of the whole court, and Bimbisāra having nothing of a material nature, which he considered precious enough to send to Pukkusāti, conceived the idea of acquainting Pukkusāti with the appearance in the world of the Three Jewels (ratanāni) the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  He had inscribed on a golden plate, four cubits long and a span in breadth, descriptions of these Three Jewels and of various tenets of the Buddha's teachings, such as the satipatthānā, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the Thirty seven factors of Enlightenment.  This plate was placed in the innermost of several caskets of various precious substances, and was taken in procession on the back of the state elephant up to the frontier of Bimbisira's kingdom.  Similar honours were paid to it by the chiefs of other territories, through which lay the route to Takkasilā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pukkusāti, in the solitude of his chamber, read the inscription on the plate, he was filled with boundless joy and decided to renounce the world.  He cut off his hair, donned the yellow robes of a monk, and left the palace alone amid the lamentations of his subjects.  He travelled the one hundred and ninety two leagues to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, passing the gates of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;; but having understood from Bimbisāra's letter that the Buddha was at Rājagaha, he omitted to enquire for him at Jetavana, and travelled on forty five leagues more to Rājagaha, only to find that the Buddha was all the time in Sāvatthi.  As it was then evening, he took lodging in Bhaggava's house.  The Buddha, with his divine eye, saw what was in store for Pukkusāti, and travelling on foot from Sāvatthi, reached Bhaggava's house at sundown, and, waiting his opportunity, engaged Pukkusāti in talk and preached to him the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta, as related above.  After his untimely death* Pukkusāti was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/avihaa,Avihā')"&gt;Avihā&lt;/a&gt; world, where, together with six others, he became an arahant at the moment of his birth (see S.i.35, 60, for the names of the others.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The cow that killed Pukkusāti is said to have been a Yakkhinī who was a cow in one hundred births.  In her last birth as a cow, she killed, in addition to Pukkusāti, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baahiya,Bāhiya Dāruciriya')"&gt;Bāhiya Dāruciriya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tambadaathika,Tambadāthika')"&gt;Tambadāthika&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; the leper (DhA.ii.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pukkhusāti was one of seven monks who, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, decided to abstain from eating until they should attain arahantship.  They lived on the top of a mountain.  The senior monk attained arahantship, the second became an anāgāmī, but the remaining five died of starvation and were reborn in Tusita.  In this age they became, respectively, Pukkusāti, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kumaara_kassapa,Kumāra Kassapa')"&gt;Kumāra Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, Dārucīriya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dabba_mallaputta_th,Dabba Mallaputta')"&gt;Dabba Mallaputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya,Sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya&lt;/a&gt;.  Ap.ii.473; DhA.ii.212; UdA.81; but see MA.i.335, where only three are mentioned (Pukkusāti, Dārucīriya, and Kassapa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He built a monastery, one yojana in extent, on the site of Jetavana, the ground of which he bought by covering the whole with golden bricks.

J.i.39; Bu.xvi.18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Phussadeva Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent teacher of the Vinaya (Vin.v.3) in Ceylon.  He was a contemporary of Upatissa, from whose views his own often differed.  See Sp.i.263; ii.456, 495; iii.  651, 653; iv.  890.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Phussadeva Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An incumbent of Katakandhakāra in Ceylon.  He was among those taking part in the assemblies mentioned in Kuddālaka, Mūgapakkha, Ayoghara and Hatthipāla Jātakas (J.iv.  490; vi.  30).  Once Māra, assuming the form of the Buddha, tried to tempt him, but the Elder, seeing this form and deriving joy from its contemplation, became an arahant.  Vsm.  263.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Phussadeva&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the chief warriors of Dutthagāmanī.  He was born in the village of Gavita and his father was Uppala.  Once, having gone to the vihāra with other boys, he saw a conch shell offered at the bodhi tree and blew on it.  All those who heard him stood as if stunned, and he came to be called Ummāda Phussadeva.  His father was an archer, and he himself became very skilled in this art (Mhv.xxiii.82f), the best archer in the island (Mhv.xxv.82).  In Dutthagāmanī's fight with Bhalluka, Phussadeva sat behind the king on the elephant and shot Bhalluka.  His arrow grazed the king's ear, causing the blood to flow.  In expiation, Phussadeva cut off the lobe of his own ear and showed it to the king.  Later the king planted Phussadeva's arrow on the floor, and covering it to its full height with kahāpanas, gave the money to Phussadeva.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Puggalapaññatti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth (in the present order) of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.  It is, however, generally considered to be the earliest of the Abhidhamma books.  Its subject matter is the puggala (person).  The author first gives a table of contents of the whole work, and then follows the method of the Anguttara Nikāya, grouping human types first under one term, then under two, and so on up to ten.  Several of the sections are found, almost complete, in the corresponding sections of the Anguttara.  Others are found in the Sangīti Sutta.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pubbaseliyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seventeen heterodox sects which arose in Jambudīpa in the second century after the Buddha's death (Mhv.v.12; Dpv.v.55).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kathāvatthu Commentary (see Points of Controversy xli.104, 108, 115) they belonged to the Andhaka school.  Their views seem to have been similar to those of the Cetiyavādins (J.R.A.S.  1910, p.  413 ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill: op.  cit., 184) they were so called because they lived on the Pūrva Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pingiyānī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Pingiyānī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of Vesāli.  The Anguttara Nikāya records a conversation between him and Kāranapāli.  The latter meets Pingiyānī and, on learning that he was returning from a visit to the Buddha, asks him about the Buddha's wisdom.  Pingiyāni utters the Buddha's praises with a wealth of simile and metaphor.  Kāranapāli is impressed, and declares himself the Buddha's follower (A.iii.236ff).  On another occasion, Pingiyāni is present when five hundred Licchavis come to pay honour to the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā.  The sight of the Buddha, sitting in their midst, outshining them all, inspires Pingiyāni and he bursts into song.  The Licchavis give him five hundred upper garments, all of which he presents to the Buddha.  Ibid., 239f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.636) that Pingiyānī was an anāgāmī.  He went daily to the Buddha, with flowers and perfumes.  See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiya,Pingiya')"&gt;Pingiya&lt;/a&gt; (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Pingiyānī&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Brahmadatta.  One day when opening her window she saw a royal groom, with whom she fell in love, and when the king fell asleep, she climbed down through the window, lay with the groom, and climbed back again, after which she perfumed herself and lay down beside the king.  The king eventually discovered her misdemeanour and proclaimed it to his ministers, depriving her of her royal rank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is one of those related by Kunāla, who is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmadatta,Brahmadatta')"&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.444).  It is perhaps this story which is referred to as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/culla_kunaala_jat_464,Culla Kunāla Jātaka')"&gt;Culla Kunāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pingiyānī Sutta&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of the brahmin Pingiyānī (q.v.) uttering the Buddha's praises before the Licchavis.  When Pingiyānī ended his song of praise, the Buddha told the Licchavis of the five kinds of rare treasures: the Tathāgata, one who can teach the Dhammavinaya, one who recognises the Dhamma, one who follows the Dhamma, and one who is grateful.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pubbakotthakā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bathing place in Sāvatthi, near the Migāramātupāsāda, and therefore to the east of the city.  Mention is made (A.iii.345) of the Buddha having bathed there.  It was evidently extensive, for Pasenadi's state elephant Seta also bathed there to the accompaniment of music.  The Commentary calls it (AA.ii.668) a nadī.  The bathing place was probably near the Pubbakotthaka (? Eastern Gatehouse) of Sāvatthi, where the Buddha is said to have stayed.  S.v.220; the bathing place seems also to have been called Pubbakotthaka.  Near by was the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka (M.i.161).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public bathing places were generally near the city gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;Details of this are given at MA.i.370f.  There were four bathing places: for the king, for the people, for the Buddha, and the Sangha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A name for the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gangaa,Ganges')"&gt;Ganges&lt;/a&gt; (E.g., J.v.93, 255; Ap.ii.436).  The river was so called because the sage Bhagīratha filled up the ocean with the Ganges whom he made his daughter (Mahābhārata, iii.  107, 9961; v.178, 7096).  It may also be the name of a separate river flowing from the Himālaya and forming one of the chief sources of the Ganges.  The river flowed past Hamsavatī (E.g., Ap.i.51; ii.343).  v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhūridatta Jātaka (No.543)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prince Brahmadatta, son of the king of Benares, lived on the banks of the Yamunā, exiled from his father's kingdom.  He wore the garb of an ascetic, but his heart was not in the ascetic life, and, when a Nāga maiden tried to seduce him, he easily succumbed.  Their children were Sāgara Brahmadatta and Samuddajā.  When the king of Benares died, Brahmadatta returned with his children to the kingdom and his Nāga wife returned to the Nāga world.  While playing about in a lake specially prepared for them, the children of Brahmadatta discovered a tortoise, Cittacūla, and were much frightened.  Cittacūla was brought before the king and was ordered to be cast into the Yamunā, that being the direst penalty the king could envisage.  Caught in a whirlpool, Cittacūla was carried to the realm of the Nāgaking Dhatarattha, and, when questioned, had the presence of mind to say that he had been sent from Benares to propose a marriage between Dhatarattha and Samuddajā.  Nāga messengers were sent to the Benares court to make arrangements, and they laid their proposal before the king.  Cittacūla had meanwhile spirited himself away.  Brahmadatta was horrified at the proposals of the messengers, and did not fail to say so, whereupon Dhatarattha was so incensed at the insult offered to him that he laid siege to Benares with his Nāga hosts.  To avert the total destruction of the city, Samuddajā was given to Dhatarattha, with whom she dwelt for a long time without discovering that she was in the Nāga world, everyone, at the king's orders, having assumed human form.  Samuddajā had four children Sudassana, Datta, Subhaga and Arittha (Kānārittha) - and one step daughter, Accimukhī.  Datta, who was the Bodhisatta, used to visit Virūpakkha, the ruler of the Nāga hosts, and one day went with him to pay homage to Sakka.  In the assembly a question arose which only Datta could answer, and Sakka was so pleased with him that he gave him the name of Bhūridatta (wise Datta).  Anxious to be born in Sakka's company, Bhūridatta took the vows and observed the fast, lying on the top of an ant hill.  At the end of the fast, Nāga maidens would come and take him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day a brahmin villager and his son, Somadatta, went hunting in the forest and spent the night on a banyan tree near where Bhūridatta lay.  At dawn, these two saw the Nāga maidens come for Bhūridatta and witnessed their song and dance, which Bhūridatta, having laid aside his snake form, much enjoyed.  Discovering the presence of the villagers, Bhūridatta entered into conversation with them, and invited them to the Nāga world, where they passed a whole year, enjoying great luxury.  Owing to lack of merit, the villagers grew discontented and wished to return to the world of men on the pretext that they wished to become ascetics.  Bhūridatta offered them a wish conferring jewel, but this they refused, saying that they had no use for it.  Once in the world of men, Somadatta and his father took off their ornaments to bathe, but these divine ornaments disappeared to the Nāga world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, while father and son were wandering about in the forest, having returned from stalking deer, they met a brahmin called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalambaayana,Alambāyana')"&gt;Alambāyana&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed a Nāga jewel.  He was a poor man of Benares who had fled into the forest to escape his creditors.  There he had met an ascetic, Kosiya, to whom a Garuda king had taught the Ālambāyana spell which was potent to tame Nāgas.  The Garuda had torn up a banyan tree, which shaded the ascetic's walk.  A Nāga, which the Garuda had seized, coiled itself round the tree, but the Garuda carried the tree with the Nāga on it.  When he discovered that he had done the ascetic an injury in pulling up the tree, he felt repentant and taught the ascetic the Ālambāyana spell by way of atonement.  The ascetic, in turn, taught it to the poor brahmin, hoping it would help him.  The brahmin, now called Ālambāyana, left the ascetic and, while wandering about, came across some Nāgas, carrying Bhūridatta's jewel.  They heard him recite the spell and fled in terror, leaving behind them the jewel, which he picked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Somadatta and his father met the brahmin, they saw the jewel, and the father schemed to steal it.  He told Ālambāyana of the difficulties connected with guarding the jewel and of how dangerous it might prove, if not duly honoured.  If Ālambāyana would give him the jewel, he would show him the abode of Bhūridatta, whom the brahmin might then capture, making money with his help.  When Somadatta realized his father's treachery, he rebuked him and fled from him.  Ālambāyana went with the villager and captured Bhūridatta and crushed his bones.  Having thus rendered the Nāga helpless.  Ālambāyana put him in a basket and travelled about making him dance before large audiences The jewel, which Ālambāyana gave to the treacherous villager, slipped from the later's hand and returned to the Nāga world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the capture of Bhūridatta, his mother had a terrifying dream, and later, when Bhūridatta had been absent for a month, she grew very anxious and lamented piteously.  A search was instituted - Kānārittha was sent to the deva world, Subhaga to Himavā, Sudassana and Accimukhī to the world of men.  Sudassana went disguised as an ascetic, and Accimukhī, assuming the form of a frog, hid in his matted hair.  They found Ālambāyana making ready to give an exhibition of Bhūridatta's dancing before the king of Benares.  Sudassana took up his stand at the edge of the crowd, and Bhūridatta, seeing him, went up to him.  The crowd retreated in fear.  When Bhūridatta was back in his basket, Sudassana challenged Ālambāyana to prove that his magic powers were greater than those of Sudassana.  This challenge was accepted, and Sudassana called out to Accimukhī who, uttering the frog's cry, stood on his shoulder, and having spat drops of poison on to his palm, went back into his hair.  Saying that the country would be destroyed if the poison fell on the earth, Sudassana had three holes dug, and filled the first with drugs, the second with cow dung, and the third with heavenly medicines.  He poured the poison into the first hole; a flame instantly burst out, spread to the second, and, having travelled on to the third, consumed all the medicines and was extinguished.  Ālambāyana was standing near the last hole: the heat of the poison smote him, the colour of his skin changed, and he became a leper.  Filled with terror, he set the Nāga free.  Bhūridatta assumed a radiant form decked with all ornaments; so did Sudassana and Accimukhī.  The king, on discovering that they were the children of Samuddajā, rejoiced greatly and entertained them.  Bhūridatta returned to the Nāga world, the king accompanying him.  The king stayed there for some days and then returned to his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subhaga, in the course of his wanderings, came across Somadatta's father, and, on discovering that it was he who had betrayed Bhūridatta, snatched him away into the Nāga world, after first nearly drowning him in the whirlpools of the Yamunā.  Kānārittha, who was guarding the entrance to the room where Bhūridatta lay ill and tired after his experiences, protested against Subhaga's ill treatment of a brahmin, and described the greatness of the brahmins and the importance of holding sacrifices and of learning the Vedas.  The Nāgas, who were listening, were greatly impressed, and Bhūridatta, seeing them in danger of accepting false doctrine, sent for Kānārittha, confuted his arguments, and converted the Nāgas to the right view.  Some time after, Bhūridatta, with his retinue, and followed by Dhatarattha, Samuddajā, and their other children, visited his grandfather Brahmadatta, who had become an ascetic.  There they met Sāgara Brahmadatta, now king of Benares, and great was the rejoicing over their reunion.  Samuddajā then returned with her family to the Nāga world, where they lived happily to the end of their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to some laymen of Sāvatthi who kept the fast diligently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta is identified with Ālambāyana, Ananda with Somadatta, Uppalavannā with Accimukhī, Sāriputta with Sudassana, Moggallāna with Subhaga, and Sunakkhatta with Kānārittha (J.vi.157 219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Bhūridatta is found also in the Cariyāpitaka (Cyp.ii.2) as the Bhūridatta cariyā, to illustrate Sīlapāramitā.  In the fifteenth century Ratthasāra, a monk of Ava, wrote a metrical version of the Bhūridatta Jātaka.  Sās.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The monk, who believes in the Buddha and obeys his instructions, will ultimately understand dukkka and will bring it to an end.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta also contains the parable of the Ajāniya horse.  A horse, schooled by an expert trainer and put through the various stages of training, becomes endowed with ten qualities, and is fit to be regarded as a treasure by a king.  Similarly, a man who has developed the Noble Eightfold Path and obtained right knowledge and right deliverance, becomes the richest field in which the seed of merit may be sown.

She was so beautiful that seven kings begged to be allowed to marry her.  Her father, unable to decide between her suitors, put her in a boat with thirty two companions and launched the boat upon the Ganges.  The boat arrived in the course of the following day at Gonagāmaka in Ceylon, where the women landed, dressed as nuns.  In due course they came to Upatissagāma, where the king, Panduvāsudeva, warned by soothsayers, awaited their arrival and married Bhaddakaccānā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, six of her brothers came to Ceylon and settled in different parts; the brothers were Rāma, Uruvela, Anurādha, Vijita, Dīghāyu and Rohana.  The seventh brother, Gāmani, stayed at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddakaccānā had ten children, the eldest being Abhaya and the youngest Ummādacittā.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhogagāmanagara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajji')"&gt;Vajji&lt;/a&gt; country, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; stayed on his last journey, in the Ananda cetiya, and where he preached a sermon on the four &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadesa_s,Mahāpadesā')"&gt;Mahāpadesā&lt;/a&gt; (the "Great Authorities") (D.ii.124f.; A.ii.167ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Bhoga he went on to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.126).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhoga was one of the places passed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvari')"&gt;Bāvari's&lt;/a&gt; pupils on their way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Magadha and patron of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ascended the throne at the age of fifteen and reigned in Rājagaha for fifty two years.  The Buddha was five years older than Bimbisāra, and it was not until fifteen years after his accession that Bimbisāra heard the Buddha preach and was converted by him.  It is said (Mhv.ii.25ff.; Dpv.iii.50ff ) that the two were friends in their youth owing to the friendship which existed between their fathers.  Bimbisāra's father was called Bhāti (MT.137; Dpv.iii.52); according to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, op.  cit., 16) he was called Mahāpaduma and his Mother Bimbī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to the Pabbajā Sutta (SN.vs.405ff.; also J.i.66 and DhA.i.85; also Rockhill, p.  27) the first meeting between the Buddha and Bimbisāra took place in Rājagaha under the Pandavapabbata, only after the Buddha's Renunciation.  The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace windows, sent messengers after him.  On learning, that he was resting after his meal, Bimbisāra followed him and offered him a place in his court.  This the Buddha refused, revealing his identity.  The Commentary adds (SNA.ii.386) that Bimbisāra wished him success in his quest and asked him to visit first Rājagaha as soon as he had attained Enlightenment.  It was in fulfilment of this promise that the Buddha visited Rājagaha immediately after his conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilā.  He stayed at the Supatittha cetiya in Latthivanuyyāna, whither Bimbisāra, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his respects.  The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with Bimbisāra at their head, became sotāpannas.  On the following day the Buddha and hiss large retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of Bimbisāra.  Sakka, in the guise of a young man, preceded them to the palace, singing songs of glory of the Buddha.  At the conclusion of the meal, Bimbisāra poured water from a golden jar on the Buddha's hand and dedicated Veluvana for the use of him and of his monks (Vin.i.35ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this gift of Veluvana, which formed the model for Devānampiyatissa's gift of the Mahāmeghavana to Mahinda (Mhv.xv.17).  The gift of Veluvana was one of the incidents sculptured in the Relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.80).  It may have been in Veluvana that the king built for the monks a storeyed house, fully plastered (Vin.ii.154).  With the attainment of sopātatti, the king declared that all the five ambitions of his life had been fulfilled: that he might become king, that the Buddha might visit his realm, that he might wait on the Buddha, that the Buddha might teach him the doctrine, that he might understand it (Vin.i.36).  According to BuA.  (p.  18f.) the king became a Sotāpanna after listening to the Mahā-Nārada Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this moment up till the time of his death, a period of thirty seven years, Bimbisāra did all in his power to help on the new religion and to further its growth.  He set an example to his subjects in the practice of the precepts by taking the uposatha vows on six days, of each month (PvA.209).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra's chief queen was Kosaladevī (q.v.), daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi.  On the day of her marriage she received, as part of her dowry, a village in Kāsi, for her bath money.  Her son was Ajātasattu (also J.iii.121).  Bimbisāra had other wives as well; Khemā, who, at first, would not even visit the Buddha till enticed by Bimbisāra's descriptions of the beauties of Veluvana; and the courtesan Padumavatī, who was brought from Ujjenī, with the help of a Yakkha, so that Rājagaha might not lack a Nagarasobhinī.  Both these later became nuns.  Padumavatī's son was Abhaya.  Bimbisāra had another son by Ambapālī, known as Vimala Kondañña, and two others, by different wives, known as Sīlava and Jayasena.  A daughter, Cundi, is also mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra's death, according to the Commentaries, was a sad one (E.g., DA.i.135 ff.; see also Vin.ii.190f).  Soothsayers had predicted, before the birth of Ajātasattu, that he would bring about the death of his father, for which reason his mother had wished to bring about an abortion.  But Bimbisāra would not hear of this, and when the boy was born, treated him with the greatest affection (for details see Ajātasattu).  When the prince came of age, Devadatta, by an exhibition of his iddhi-power, won him over to his side and persuaded him to encompass the death of his father, Bimbisāra's patronage of the Buddha being the greatest obstacle in the path of Devadatta.  The plot was discovered, and Bimbisāra's ministers advised him to kill Ajātasattu, Devadatta and their associates.  But Bimbisāra sent for Ajātasattu and, on hearing that he desired power, abdicated in his favour.  Devadatta chided Ajātasattu for a fool.  "You are like a man who puts a skin over a drum in which is a rat," and he urged on Ajātasattu the need for the destruction of Bimbisāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no weapon could injure Bimbisāra (probably because he was a Sotāpanna, he also had the power of judging the status of anyone by his voice - e.g., in the case of Kumbhaghosa, DhA.i.233), it was therefore decided that he should be starved to death, and with this end in view he was imprisoned in a hot house (tāpanageha) with orders that none but the mother of Ajātasattu should visit him.  On her visits she took with her a golden vessel filled with food which she concealed in her clothes.  When this was discovered she took food in her head dress (molī), and, later, she was obliged to take what food she could conceal in her footgear.  But all these ways were discovered, and then the queen visited Bimbisāra after having bathed in scented water and smeared her person with catumadhura (the four kinds of sweets).  The king licked her person and that was his only sustenance.  In the end the visits of the queen were forbidden; but the king continued to live by walking about his cell meditating.  Ajātasattu, hearing of this, sent barbers to cut open his feet, fill the wounds with salt and vinegar, and burn them with coals.  It is said that when the barbers appeared Bimbisāra thought his son had relented and had sent them to shave him and cut his hair.  But on learning their real purpose, he showed not the least resentment and let them do their work, much against their will.  (In a previous birth he had walked about in the courtyard of a cetiya with shoes on, hence this punishment!) Soon after, Bimbisāra died, and was reborn in the Cātummahārājika world as a Yakkha named Janavasabbha, in the retinue of Vessavana.  The Janavasabha Sutta records an account of a visit paid by Janavasabha to the Buddha some time after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A son was born to Ajātasattu on the day of Bimbisāra's death.  The joy be experienced at the birth of his son made him realize something of the affection his own father must have felt for him, and he questioned his mother.  She told him stories of his childhood, and he repented, rather belatedly, of his folly and cruelty.  Soon after, his mother died of grief, and her death gave rise to the protracted war between Ajātasattu and Pasenadi, as mentioned elsewhere (J.ii.237, 403).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books contain no mention of any special sermons preached by the Buddha to Bimbisāra nor of any questions asked by him of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he heard that the Buddha intended to perform a miracle, although he had ordered his disciples to refrain from doing so, Bimbisāra had doubts about the propriety of this and questioned the Buddha who set his doubts at rest (DhA.iii.204; J.iii.263f.).  It was also at the request of Bimbisāra that the Buddha established the custom of the monks assembling on the first, eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth days of each month (Vin.i.101f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, like Anāthapindika, his equal in devotion to the Buddha, he refrained from giving the Buddha extra trouble, or perhaps the affairs of his kingdom, which was three hundred leagues in extent, did not permit him enough leisure for frequent visits to the Buddha.  (DhA.iii.205; the kingdom included eighty thousand villages, gāma, Vin.i.179).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that he once visited four monks - Godhika, Subāhu, Valliya and Uttiya - and invited them to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha.  He built for them four huts, but forgot to have them roofed, with the result that the gods withheld the rains until the king remembered the omission (ThagA.i.125).  He similarly forgot his promise to give Pilindavaccha a park keeper, if the Buddha would sanction such a gift.  Five hundred days later he remembered his promise and to make amends, gave five hundred park keepers with a special village for their residence, called Ārāmikagāma or Pilindagāma (Vin.i.207f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra's affection for the Buddha was unbounded.  When the Licchavis sent Mahāli, who was a member of Bimbisāra's retinue, to beg the Buddha to visit Vesāli, Bimbisāra did not himself try to persuade the Buddha to do so, but when the Buddha agreed to go he repaired the whole road from Rājagaha to the Ganges - a distance of five leagues - for the Buddha to walk upon; he erected a rest house at the end of each league, and spread flowers of five different colours knee deep along the whole way.  Two parasols were provided for the Buddha and one for each monk.  The king himself accompanied the Buddha in order to look after him, offering him flowers and perfume and all requisites throughout the journey, which lasted five days.  Arrived at the river, he fastened two boats together decked with flowers and jewels and followed the Buddha's boat into the water up to his neck.  When the Buddha had gone, the king set up an encampment on the river bank, awaiting his return; he then escorted him back to Rājagaha with similar pomp and ceremony (DhA.iii.438 ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great cordiality existed between Bimbisāra and Pasenadi.  They were connected by marriage, each having married a sister of the other.  Pasenadi once visited Bimbisāra in order to obtain from him a person of unbounded wealth (amitabhoga) for his kingdom.  Bimbisāra had five such - Jotiya, Jatila, Mendaka, Punnaka and Kākavaliya; but Pasenadi had none.  The request was granted, and Mendaka's son, Dhanañjaya, was sent back to Kosala with Pasenadi (DhA.i.385f.; AA.i.220).  Some of these were richer than Bimbisāra- e.g., Jotiya (q.v.), whose house was built entirely of jewels while the king's palace was of wood; but the king showed no jealousy (DhA.iv.211).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra also maintained friendly relations with other kings, such as Pukkasāti, king of Takkasilā, Candappajjota, king of Ujjenī, to whom he sent his own physician Jīvaka to tend in his illness - and Rudrāyana of Roruka (Dvy.545).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the ministers and personal retinue of Bimbisāra are mentioned Sona-Kolvisa, the flower gatherer Sumana who supplied the king with eight measures of jasmine flowers, the minister Koliya, the treasurer Kumbbaghosaka and his physician Jīvaka.  The last named was discovered for him by the prince Abhaya when he was suffering from a fistula.  The king's garments were stained with blood and his queens mocked him.  Jīvaka cured the king with one single anointing; the king offered him the ornaments of the five hundred women of the palace, and when he refused to take these, he was appointed physician to the king, the women of the seraglio and the fraternity of monks under the Buddha (Vin.i.272f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dhammadinnā wished to leave the world, Bimbisāra gave her, at her husband's request, a golden palanquin and allowed her to go round the city in procession (MA.i.516).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra is generally referred to as Seniya Bimbisāra.  The Commentaries explain Seniya as meaning "possessed of a large following" or as "belonging to the Seniyagotta," and Bimbisāra as meaning "of a golden colour," bimbī meaning gold (e.g., UdA.104).  According to Tibetan sources, Bimbī was the name of his mother, and from this his own name was derived; but another reason was that he was radiant like the morning sun (Rockhill 16, See also MA.i.292).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Phussa Buddha, when the Buddha's three step brothers, sons of King Jayasena, obtained their father's leave to entertain the Buddha for three months, Bimbisāra, then head of a certain district, looked after all the arrangements.  His associates in this task were born as petas, and he gave alms to the Buddha in their name in order to relieve their sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Tirokudda Sutta, also PvA.21ff.; for his intercession on behalf of another pets.  see PvA.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his lifetime, Bimbisāra was considered the happiest of men, but the Buddha declared (e.g., M.i.95) that he himself was far happier than the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kahāpana in use in Rājagaha during Bimbisāra's time was the standard of money adopted by the Buddha in the formation of those rules into which the matter of money entered (Sp.ii.297).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra had a white banner and one of his epithets was Pandaraketu (Thag.vs.64; ThagA.i.147).  Nothing is said about his future destiny, but he is represented in the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.206) as expressing the wish to become a Sakadāgāmī, and this wish may have been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddavatikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A market town near Kosambī.  The Buddha went there and was warned by cowherds and others not to approach Ambatittha as a fierce Nāga dwelt there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāgata Thera, hearing this, went to Ambatittha and subdued the Nāga, afterwards rejoining the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā (Vin.iv.108f.; J.i.360f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town is probably identical with Bhaddavatī (q.v.), and was in the Cetiya Country.

Buddhappiya Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was a native of Cola, but studied in Ceylon under Ananda Vanaratana.  He was the head of Bālādicca-vihāra and wrote two books, the Rūpasiddhi and the Pajjamadhu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also known as Coliya Dīpankara.

Vijaya lived there for three months before sailing for Ceylon.  Dpv.ix.26; the Dvy.  (586) says the city was founded by Bhiru, one of the three people who escaped from the kingdom of Sikhandi, the parricide ruler of Sauvīra, when this was destroyed by a heavy fall of sand, following on the murder of Rudrāyana, king of Roruka.  Bharukaccha is, according to this account, a corruption of Bhīrukaccha (Marsh of Bhiru).  But Brahmanized tradition ascribes its foundation to the sage Bhrgu.  It is identical with Barygaza of Ptolemy and the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharukaccha is the modern Broach in Kathiawar.  The people of Bharukaccha are called Bharukacchakā.  E.g., DhSA.305.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bharukaccha&lt;/b&gt;.  A park in Ceylon laid out by Parakkamabāhu I.  Cv.lxxix.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Babbu Jātaka (No.137)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was once a rich merchant of &lt;b&gt;Kāsi&lt;/b&gt; who amassed forty crores of gold.  His wife died and, because of her love of money, was reborn as a mouse dwelling over the family treasure.  In due course the rest of the family died and the village was deserted.  The Bodhisiatta was a stone cutter, working a quarry near the mouse's residence.  She, liking him, brought him one day a coin, suggesting that, with a part of it, he should buy her some meat.  The Bodhisatta agreed, and this continued for some time.  One day the mouse was caught by a cat, but she obtained her release by promising him some of her food.  She was later caught by three other cats, but was let free on the same terms.  The mouse thus had only one fifth of her food and grew very thin.  The Bodhisiatta noticed this, and when she told him the reason, he put her inside a crystal box and suggested that when the cats came she should refuse to have anything to do with them.  The first cat arrived and, on being reviled by the mouse, jumped on the crystal box and was crushed to death.  The same fate overtook the other cats.  The mouse thus became free, and in gratitude to the Bodhisatta, showed him all the treasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;b&gt;Kānā&lt;/b&gt; (q.v.), who lost her husband owing to four monks.  The monks were the cats and Kānā the mouse.  J.i.477 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Bhadda.&lt;/b&gt; A lay disciple of Nādikā who, the Buddha declared, had destroyed the five orambhāgiyasamyojanā and had been born in the highest deva worlds, thence to pass away entirely.  D.ii.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhadda Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was born in the family of a setthi of Sāvatthi.  His parents had gone to the Buddha before his conception, and had told him that if they had a child they would give him to the Buddha as his servant.  When he was seven years old, they took him, arrayed in his best, to the Buddha, in fulfilment of their promise.  The Buddha asked Ananda to ordain him.  This he did and instructed him, and the same night Bhadda became an arahant.  The Buddha called to him saying, "Come, Bhadda," and that was his upasampadā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had offered hundreds of thousands of robes, etc., to the Buddha and his monks.  Thag.vss.473-9; ThagA.i.474f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhadda Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps to be identified with Bhadda (2).  He is mentioned as staying at the Kukkutārāma in Pātaliputta in the company of Ananda, with whom he discussed the righteous and the unrighteous life (S.v.15f) and the cultivation of the satipatthānas.  S.v.171f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhadda&lt;/b&gt;.  One of the two chief disciples of Kondañña Buddha.  J.i.30; Bu.iii.304.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Badarikārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A park about three miles from Kosambī (S.iii.126) where Khemaka stayed during his illness.  He was visited by monks from the Ghositārāma (SA.ii.230).  The Buddha is said to have stayed there and to have preached the Tipallatthamiga Jātaka (J.i.160) and the Tittira Jātaka (J.iii.64) regarding Rāhula (q.v.), who spent a whole night in the Buddha's jakes at the Badarikārāma because he was unwilling to violate the rule laid down by the Buddha that no novice should share the room of an ordained monk (see also Vin.iv.16).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Bhikkhunī Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Once a nun, being enamoured of Ananda, sent a message asking him to visit her, saying that she was ill.  Ananda came and preached to her on the body, how food should be taken only to sustain it, how craving for food should be abandoned together with pride and desire for sexual relations.  The nun was overcome with shame at her intended deception and, falling at Ananda's feet, begged his forgiveness.  A.ii.144f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A.iii.57ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhaddā.&lt;/b&gt; A woman of Kimbila; she was the wife of Rohaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became famous in the city as a virtuous woman (bhadditthī) on account of her goodness and was admired even by the gods.  One festival day, while her husband was away in Takkasilā on business, she greatly longed to be with him.  The spirit of the house conveyed her thither, and from their union a child was born.  Her virtue was doubted by her relations, but she convinced them by arresting a flood with an "Act of Truth." Her husband was also suspicious, but she convinced him by producing a signet ring, which he had given her in Takkasilā.  Thus she became famous through her virtue.  After death she was born in Tāvatimsa, where she met the Buddha on his visit there, and at his request related to him her story.  Vv.ii.5; VvA.109ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A roving jackal, wishing to eat them, took up his stand near their home, poised on one leg, feigning great holiness.  Impressed by his austerities, the Bodhisatta and his troop worshipped him, and each day the jackal ate the rat, which was hindmost when they turned to leave him.  Seeing their number diminish, the Bodhisatta suspected the reason, and one day he himself came last, behind the others.  When the jackal pounced on him, he sprang at his throat and killed him, the other rats eating the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who was a hypocrite.

At this announcement there was a great earthquake, the reason for which Ananda enquires of the Buddha, who enlightens him.  A.iv.308ff; D.ii.102f.; S.v.259; Ud.vi.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bindusāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; and father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka,Asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of Candagutta and reigned for twenty eight years.  He had one hundred sons - the eldest being Sumana - ninety nine of whom were killed by Asoka (Mhv.v.18 f., 38f.; Dpv.v.101; vi.15; some accounts, e.g., MT.324, say he had one hundred and one sons).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bindusāra patronised the brahmins and provided constant meals for sixty thousand brahmins of various sects (Sp.i.44).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother was Candagutta's maternal cousin and chief queen.  One day, while Bindusāra was yet unborn, she was eating with Candagutta and he fed her with some food prepared for himself.  The food contained poison, placed there by the orders of Candagutta's minister, Cānakka, that the king might gradually be made immune from poison.  Cānakka entered as she was about to swallow the food, and, anxious to save the unborn child, he cut off the queen's head with a sword before the food could travel down into her stomach, opened her womb, removed the child, and placed it in the womb of a freshly slaughtered goat.  For seven days the child lay in the womb of a goat, each day a fresh one, until, at the end of these seven days, the child was ready for birth.  Because of this, Bindusāra's body was spotted in various places from the blood of the goats, and from this he obtained his name (MT.187f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bindusāra's chief queen was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammaa,Dhammā')"&gt;Dhammā&lt;/a&gt; of the Moriya clan.  She bore two sons, Asoka and Tissa (MT.189, 324).  Bindusāra had to kill the Yakkha Devagabbha (q.v.) before he could ascend the throne (MT.188).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhagalavatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A place in Uttarakuru where the Yakkhas assemble.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dīgha Nikāya (D.iii.201) speaks of it as a hall (sabhā), while the Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.197) says it is a mountain in Himavā where the devas assemble every month for eight days in order to settle disputes.  The Yakkha leaders also attend these assemblies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sumangalavilāsinī (DA.iii.967), however, says that it is a jewelled pavilion (ratanamandapa) twelve leagues in extent, on the banks of the Dharanī Lake.  It is surrounded by a creeper named Bhagalavatī, hence, probably, its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bodhāhārakula, Bodhidhārakula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That name given to the descendants of the eight families who brought the branch of the Bodhi tree from Pātaliputta to Ceylon (Mhv.xix.67).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heads of the families were brothers of Vedisadevī, wife of Asoka, and they were led by Sumitta and Bodhigutta (Mbv.  p.  154).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others (Mbv.  p.  165) were Candagutta, Devagutta, Dhammagutta, Suriyagutta, Gotama and Jutindhara.  They were entrusted with the ceremonies in connection with the Bodhi tree at Anurādhapura and each was given a special office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bala Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

Bala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The five powers (saddhā, viriya, sati, samādhi, paññā) constitute the path which leads to the Uncompounded.  S.iv.361.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Bala Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The practice of these five powers (see 6) is the path to the Uncompounded.  S.iv.366.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Bala Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The eight powers of eight beings: weeping in children, anger in women, weapons with thieves, power in kings, discontent with fools, understanding with the wise, consideration with the learned, forgiveness with ascetics and recluses.  A.iv.223.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhojājānīya Jātaka (No.23)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as a thoroughbred horse and was made the destrier of the king of Benares.  He was given every kind of luxury and was shown all honour.  All the king's around coveted the kingdom of Benares, and seven kings encompassed the city.  At the suggestion of his ministers, the king sent out a knight on the royal destrier.  Mounted on the noble steed, the knight destroyed six camps, when his horse was wounded.  He thereupon took it to the gate, loosened its armour, and prepared to arm another horse.  But the animal, knowing that no other horse could accomplish what awaited him, insisted on attacking the seventh camp.  Then when they brought him back to the king's gate, the king came out to look upon him, and the horse died with a counsel for mercy towards the captive kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who had given up persevering.  Ananda is identified with the king.  J.i.178 81. Cp.  the Ajañña Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bharu Jātaka (No.213)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was leader of a band of five hundred ascetics in Himavā.  One day they came to the city of Bharu for salt and vinegar, and took up their residence under a banyan-tree to the north of the city.  A similar group remained under a tree to the south.  Next year, the tree to the south of the city was found to have withered away, and the group who had lived there, having arrived first, took possession of the other tree, to the north.  This led to a dispute between the two groups, and they sought the intervention of Bharu, king of the Bharu country.  He decided in favour of one group, but being bribed by the other, he changed his mind.  Later, the ascetics repented of their greed and hastened back to Himavā.  The gods, angry with the king, submerged the whole of Bharu, three hundred leagues in extent, under the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Pasenadi, king of Kosala, who took bribes from some heretics and gave permission for them to build a centre near Jetavana.  When the Buddha heard of it, he sent monks to interview the king, but the latter refused to receive even the Chief Disciples.  The Buddha then went himself and dissuaded the king from giving permission for an act which would lead to endless dissensions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.ii.169ff.; the story is also given at SA.iii.218 f., which says further that Pasenadi built the Rājakārāma to make amends for his fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buddhakula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of the brahmin of Sāketa mentioned in the Commentary to the Jarā Sutta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his wife had been the parents of the Buddha in five hundred births, and when they saw him at Sāketa they greeted him like a long lost son.  Thenceforth they were known as Buddhapitā and Buddhamātā and their family as Buddhakula.  SNA.ii.531ff.; see also the Sāketa Jātaka and Avadāna Sataka ii.  41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhīmaratha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhīmaratha.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the vassal kings of Dandakī who sinned against Kisavaccha.  When Dandakī and his kingdom were destroyed, Kālinga, Atthaka and Bhīmaratha, in the company of Sakka, sought Sarabhanga.  Sarabhanga preached to them and they became free from sensuality.  J.v.135, 137, 149.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhīmaratha.  &lt;/b&gt; A king and a city of the same name.  Siddhattha Buddha preached to the king, and ninety crores of beings understood the Truth.  Bu.xvii.4; BuA.186.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhīmaratha.&lt;/b&gt; A king of seventy seven kappas ago, a previous birth of Sīrivaddha (Kinkinipupphiya) Thera.  Ap.i.204; ThagA.i.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bilālidāyaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bilālidāyaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was an ascetic in the Himālaya and offered the Buddha some bilāli tubers.  Fifty four kappas ago he was a king called Sumekhali (Ap.i.145) (v.l.  Sumelaya).  He is probably identical with Kosalavihārī Thera.  ThagA.i.134f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bilālidāyaka Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  Fifty four kappas ago he gave some bilāli tubers to a recluse at the foot of the mountain Romasa.  Ap.i.232.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhisa Jātaka (No.488)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta, was born into a family which had eighty crores.  He was called Mahā Kañcana and had six younger brothers (the eldest of them being Upakañcana) and a sister, Kañcanadevi.  None of them would marry, and, on the death of their parents, they distributed their wealth, and, together with a servant man and maid, they went into the Himālaya and became ascetics, gathering wild fruits for food.  Later, they agreed that Mahā Kañcana, Kañcanadevi and the maid should be spared the task of collecting fruit and that the others should do this in turn.  Each day the fruits collected were divided into lots and the gong was sounded.  The ascetics would then come one by one and take each his or her share.  By the glory of their virtues, Sakka's throne trembled.  In order to test them, for three days in succession he caused Mahā Kañcana's share to disappear.  On the third day, Mahā Kañcana summoned the others and asked the reason for this.  Each protested his innocence and swore an oath that heavy curses should attend them if any were guilty of stealing so much as a lotus stalk (bhisa).  In each case punishment was to be that in their next birth they should have lands, possessions and other encumbrances - which, from an ascetic's point of view, would be a grievous thing.  At this gathering were also present the chief deity of the forest, an elephant escaped from a stake, a monkey who had once belonged to a snake charmer, and Sakka, who remained invisible.  At the end of their protestations of innocence, Sakka inquired of Mahā Kañcana why they all so dreaded possessions; on hearing the explanation, he was greatly moved and asked pardon of the ascetics for his trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in the same circumstances as the Kusa Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Punna, Kassapa, Anuruddha and Ananda were the Bodhisatta's brothers, Uppalavannā the sister, Khujjuttarā the maid, Citta-gahapati the servant, Sātāgiri the forest deity, Pārileyya the elephant, Madhuvāsettha the monkey and Kāludāyi, Sakka (J.iv.304 14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bhisacariyā is included in the Cariyā Pitaka (J.iii.4), and the story is also found in the Jātakamālā, No.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhiyyasa&lt;/b&gt; (Bhīya)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the two chief disciples of Konāgamana Buddha (J.i.43; Bu.xxiv.22; D.ii.5, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a royal prince, and the Buddha preached to him and to his companion, Uttara, together with their thirty thousand followers, at Sundaravatī.  BuA.215.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Bandhura Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of the setthi of &lt;b&gt;Sīlavatī&lt;/b&gt;.  Having gone to &lt;b&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/b&gt; on business and heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order, winning arahantship in due course.  He later returned to Silāvatī and preached to the king, who became a convert, and built for him a vihāra called &lt;b&gt;Sudassana&lt;/b&gt; and paid him great honour.  Bandhura gave the vihāra to the monks and returned to Sāvatthi, saying that he had no need of possessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;b&gt;Siddhattha Buddha&lt;/b&gt; he was a watchman in the king's palace and offered kanavera flowers to the Buddha and his monks.  Thag.vs.103; ThagA.207f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with &lt;b&gt;Kanaverapupphiya&lt;/b&gt; of the Apadāna (Ap.i.182).  v.l.  &lt;b&gt;Sandhaya&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Sandhava&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhikkhunīvāsaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda visits a settlement of nuns at Sāvatthi and is told that the nuns who have cultivated the four satipatthānas have attained to greater excellence of comprehension than before.  Ananda says that is how it should be.  Later, he visits the Buddha and reports to him the incident.  The Buddha tells him how to develop the satipatthānas and of the advantages resulting there from.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta ends with an exhortation to earnestness and diligence.  There are plenty of places suitable for meditation, one should not therefore be remiss with regard to this.  S.v.154f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bīrānī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A goddess (devadhītā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a palace in the Cātummahārājika world which Nimi saw on his visit to heaven when he learnt her story from Mātali.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha she had been a slave in a brahmin's house.  The brahmin, whose name was Asoka, invited eight monks to feed daily at his house and asked his wife to arrange to feed them at a cost of one kahāpana each.  This she refused to do as did also his daughters; but their slave agreed to carry out this work, and she did it most conscientiously and with great devotion.  As a result she was reborn in heaven (J.vi.117f).  Her palace was twelve leagues in height and one in extent; it possessed nine storeys and one thousand rooms.  When Dutthagāmanī wished to erect the Lohapāsāda, he asked the monks for a plan, and eight arahants went to the deva world and returned with a plan of Bīranī's palace.  Mhv.xxvii.9ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhattabhatika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A labourer who, in return for three years' work, obtained the privilege of enjoying the luxuries of the Treasurer Gandha (q.v.).  When he was ready to eat, however, a Pacceka Buddha appeared and Bhattabhatika gave him all his food.  When Gandha discovered this, he made over to Bhattabhatika one half of all his possessions, and they became firm friends.  The king made Bhattabhatika a Treasurer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After death he was born in the deva worlds, whence he was reborn in Sāvatthi as Sukhakumāra.  DhA.iii.87ff.; for the rest of the story see Sukha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahmā Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Brahmā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha is under the Ajapālanigrodha, soon after the Enlightenment, pondering on the four satipatthānas as the only way to Nibbanā.  Sahampati visits him and agrees with his sentime&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;nts.  S.v.167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Brahmā Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The scene is the same as in the above.  The Buddha is reflecting on the five indriyas (saddhā, sati, etc.), as the way to Nibbāna, and Sahampati visits him and agrees with him, relating how, when he was a monk named Sahaka, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, he developed the five indriyas and was born in the Brahma world.  S.v.232f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brāhmanadhammika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several old and decrepit but wealthy (Mahāsāla) brahmins of Kosala, visit the Buddha at Jetavana and ask him if the practices of the brahmins of their own day are in conformity with those of old.  The Buddha answers in the negative and describes in detail the high moral standard of the lives of ancient brahmins.  In course of time, however, the brahmins were disturbed by the sight of the king's wealth and adomed and bejewelled women, and became covetous of these.  They thereupon induced the king to make offerings and hold sacrifices of animals that these might be for their own gain.  Thus righteousuess decayed and disease became prevalent among men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brahmins, pleased with the Buddha's sermon, declared themselves his followers.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beluvapanduvīnā &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lute carried by Pañcasikha (q.v.); it belonged originally to Māra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Māra, after wasting seven years trying in vain to discover some shortcoming in the Buddha &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- six years before the Enlightenment and one year after it &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- left the Buddha in disgust and weariness, the lute which he carried slung on his shoulder slipped and fell.  Sakka picked it up and gave it to Paññcasikha.  It was so powerful that when plucked with the fingers the lovely music produced echoed on for four months (SNA.ii.393f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vīnā was three gāvutas in length (BuA.239) and had fifty trestles (AA.i.72).  The Sumangala Vilāsinī (DA.iii.699) describes it at length.  It was pale yellow, like a ripe beluva fruit.  Its base (pokkhara) was of gold, its stem of sapphire its strings of silver, and its knots (vethikā) of coral.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vīnā was probably so called partly because its base was made of a bilva-fruit, instead of the usual gourd, and partly because of its colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bilangika Bhāradvāja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja,Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; brothers.  On hearing that the eldest of the clan had entered the Order, he went to the Buddha, and, unable to speak for rage, sat on one side, sulking.  The Buddha preached to him, and he was pleased and entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course (S.i.164; DhA.iv.163).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (SA.1.178f) that he had earned large profits by running a shop for different kinds of excellently prepared "congey" (kañjikā).  The name Bilangika (bilanga being another name for such preparations) was given him by the Recensionists at the Third Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhūripañha Jātaka (No.452)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a section of the Mahā Ummagga Jātaka, which describes how Mahosadha, having lost the king's favour, lived with a potter.  The deity of the king's parasol put several questions to the king, but his wise men (Senaka and others) were unable to answer them.  The king then sent messengers with gifts to look for Mahosadha; they found him in the potter's hut and brought him back.  The king expressed surprise that Mahosadha should have borne him no resentment.  Mahosadha pointed out to him that wise men were incapable of ingratitude or meanness.  J.vi.372-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beluva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; spent his last vassa.  This was ten months before his death (SA.iii.198).  According to the Commentaries (e.g., UdA.322; SA.iii.172) the Buddha did not go straight from Beluva to Vesāli, but turned back to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;.  He fell grievously ill during this period, but, by a great effort of will, overcame his sickness.  During this sickness &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sākka')"&gt;Sākka&lt;/a&gt; ministered to the Buddha, waiting on him and carrying on his head the Buddha's stools when he suffered from acute dysentery (DhA.iii.269 f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that the Buddha, in answer to a question by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;, said that he had kept nothing back from his disciples and had no special instructions for the Order to follow after his death.  Each disciple must work out his own salvation.  D.ii.98 ff.; S.v.151ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is also mentioned as having stayed at Beluva after the Buddha's death.  The householder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dasama,Dasama')"&gt;Dasama&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/a5_az,Atthakanagara')"&gt;Atthakanagara&lt;/a&gt; sought him there, amid their conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthaka_naagara_s,Atthakanagara Sutta')"&gt;Atthakanagara Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.349ff.; A.v.342ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beluva was a small village, and when the Buddha was there the monks stayed in Vesāli.  Beluva was just outside the gates of Vesāli (SA.iii.165) and was to the south of this city (MA.ii.571).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā (vs.919) states that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; died at Veluvagāma in the Vajjī country.  This probably refers to Beluvagāma, in which case Veluva is a varia lectio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhuvanekabāhu-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;parivena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastic building in the Billaselavihāra in Hatthiselapura, erected by Bhuvanekabāhu, younger brother of Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxv.59).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhuvanekabāhu was cremated there, and Vijayabāhu IV.  erected a three storied building on the spot, with a Buddha image.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also set up a statue of Bhuvanekabāhu with all ornaments and gave a maintenance village for the vihāra.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhattasūpagāma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Rohana, where a great battle was fought between the forces of Parakkamabāhu 1. and the rebels who wished to take possession of the Buddha's Tooth Relic and Alms Bowl.  Parakkama's forces were victorious.  Cv.lxxiv.135.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buddhaghosa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Buddhaghosa Thera&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest of Commentators on the Tipitaka.  He was a Brahmin.  The Sās.  (p.  29) says his father was a purohita, named Kesa, his mother being Kesī.  Gv.66 says his father was the purohita of King Sangāma.  He was born in a village near Buddhagayā and became proficient in the Vedas and allied branches of knowledge.  One day he met a monk, named Revata, and on being defeated by him in controversy, entered the Order to learn the Buddha's teachings.  Because his speech was profound, like that of the Buddha, and because his words spread throughout the world (like those of the Buddha), he came to be called Buddhaghosa.  While dwelling with Revata, he wrote the Ñānodaya and the Atthasālinī, and also began to write a Parittatthakathā (a concise commentary) on the Tipitakas.  In order to complete his task, he came over to Ceylon at the suggestion of Revata (Sās.p.29, says he was sent to Ceylon as punishment for thinking himself wiser than his teachers) and studied the Singhalese Commentaries at the Mahāvihāra, under Sanghapāla.  When his studies were ended he wrote the Visuddhimagga, and having thereby won the approval of the Elders of the Mahāvihāra, he rendered the Singhalese Commentaries into Pāli.  During this period he lived in the Ganthākaravihāra, and on the accomplishment of his task he returned to Jambudīpa.  (Burmese tradition says he obtained his copy of the Tipitaka and the Commentaries from the Āloka vihāra.  But see P.L.C.83, n.1.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the above mentioned works of Buddhaghosa, we have also the Samantapāsādikā and the Kankhāvitaranī on the Vinaya Pitaka; the Sumangalavilāsinī, the Papañcasūdanī, the Sāratthappakāsinī and the Manorathapūranī on the Sutta Pitaka.  He is also said to have compiled Commentaries on the Khuddakapātha and the Sutta Nipāta (called the Paramatthajotikā) and on the Dhammapada.  He also wrote a series of Commentaries on the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the Atthasālinī, the Sammohavinodanī and the Pañcappakaranatthakathā).  Some ascribe to him the Jātakatthakathā.  For further particulars relating to Buddhaghosa, see Law's "Life and work of Buddhaghosa" and P.L.C.79 ff.  The account of his life given here is taken from Cv.xxxvii.215ff .  For a list of works ascribed to Buddhaghosa see Gv., pp.59 and 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Buddhaghosa.  &lt;/b&gt; Called Culla Buddhaghosa to distinguish him from the greater.  He was a native of Ceylon (Gv.67), and two works are ascribed to him (Gv.63) - the Jātattagīnidāna and the Sotattagīnidāna.  The former probably refers to the Jātakatthakathā (P.L.C.126).  It was at his request that Buddhaghosa (1) wrote his Commentaries to the Abhidhamma.  Gv.68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulī &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a gotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They claimed one eighth share of the Buddha's relics and raised a thūpa over them in their city of Allakappa (D.ii.167).  Their territory was probably near Vethadīpa, because the king of Allakappa is mentioned (DhA.i.161) as being in intimate relationship with the king of Vethadīpa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddaji Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion between Bhaddaji and Ananda at the Ghositārāma.  In answer to Ananda's questions, Bhaddaji says that Brahmā is the best of sights; the best of sounds is that of Radiant Devas shouting "Joy, joy," etc.  Ananda says that such is the talk of puthujjanas.  The best sight, in his view, is that of the destruction of the āsavas; the best sound that of their destruction, etc.  A.iii.202f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Baladeva&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of the sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devagabbhaa,Devagabbhā')"&gt;Devagabbhā&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers known as the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa,Andhakavenhuputtā')"&gt;Andhakavenhuputtā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baladeva killed Cānura and Mutthika.  The latter, when dying, vowed vengeance and, having been born as a goblin in the Kālamattikā forest, assumed the form of a wrestler when Baladeva passed that way and killed and ate him.  J.iv.81, 82, 88; PvA.11, 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhāradvāja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhāradvāja&lt;/b&gt;.  One of the two chief disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.  J.i.43; Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.293.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.  Bhāradvāja Thera&lt;/b&gt;.  He belonged to the Bhāradvājagotta and was a brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  He sent his son&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhadinna_th,Kanhadinna')"&gt;Kanhadinna&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;, to study under a certain teacher, but, on the way there, the boy met a Thera, entered the Order, and became an arahant.  Bhāradvāja, too, heard the Buddha preach at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/veluvana,Veluvana')"&gt;Veluvana&lt;/a&gt;, became a monk, and attained arahantship.  Later, when Kanhadinna visited the Buddha at Rājagaha, he met his father and learnt from him of his attainments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty one kappas ago, Bhāradvāja met the Pacceka Buddha Sumana and gave him a vallīkāra fruit (Thag.vss.177 8; ThagA.i.302f).  He is, perhaps, identical with Vallīkāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna.  Ap.ii.416; but the same Apadāna verses are given under Bhalliya (ThagA.i.49).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhāradvāja Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He was the eldest of a clan of Bhāradvājas living in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; and his wife was a Dhanañjāni brahminee.  The wife was a devout follower of the Buddha, and constantly sang the praises of the Buddha, of his teachings, and of the Order.  Annoyed at this, Bhāradvāja went to the Buddha and asked a question.  He was so pleased with the answer that he joined the Order and not long after became an arahant (S.i.160f), several of his brothers following his example.  (See Bhāradvāja 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;4. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bhāradvāja.  &lt;/b&gt; A young brahmin, pupil of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taarukkha,Tārukkha')"&gt;Tārukkha&lt;/a&gt;.  A discussion between him and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasettha,Vāsettha')"&gt;Vāsettha&lt;/a&gt; led to the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tevijja_s,Tevijja Sutta')"&gt;Tevijja Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.235), and also the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasettha_sutta,Vāsettha Sutta')"&gt;Vāsettha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (SN., p.115ff.; M.ii.197f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhāradvāja later became the Buddha's follower (D.i.252; SN., p.  123).  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/agganna_sutta,Aggañña Sutta')"&gt;Aggañña Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached to him and to Vāsettha when they were undergoing the probationary period prior to their becoming fully ordained monks (D.iii.80).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.860) that they accepted the Buddha as their teacher at the conclusion of the Vāsettha Sutta and entered the Order at the end of the Tevijja Sutta.  Later, while meditating on the teachings of the Aggañña Sutta, they became arahants (DA.iii.872).  According to Buddhaghosa, Bhāradvāja belonged to a noble family worth forty five crores (DA.iii.860).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;5. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bhāradvāja.  &lt;/b&gt; The name of a brahmin clan; about twenty individuals belonging to this clan are mentioned in the Pitakas.  In one family, living at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest was married to a Dhanañjāni brahmince and later became an arahant.  (See Bhāradvāja3) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brothers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Akkosaka Bhāradvāja, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asurindaka Bhāradvāja, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bilangika Bhāradvāja and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sangārava Bhāradvāja, followed him (S.i.160ff.; SA.i.175ff.; MA.ii.808).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other Bhāradvājas living in Sāvatthi visited the Buddha there, and joined the Order and became arahants; viz., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ahimsaka_bh,Ahimsaka Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Ahimsaka Bhāradvāja, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jatā Bhāradvāja and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suddhika Bhāradvāja; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggika Bhāradvāja joined the Order at Veluvana, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sundarika Bhāradvāja on the banks of the Sundarikā, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bahudhītīka Bhāradvāja in a forest tract in Kosala.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kasi Bhāradvāja, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Katthahāra Bhāradvāja and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navakammaki Bhāradvāja became lay disciples.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pindola,Pindola')"&gt;Pindola&lt;/a&gt; also belonged to the Bhāradvājagotta; so did Kāpathika (M.ii.169f).  The gotta was evidently considered to be very ancient.  Mention is made in the books of a Bhāradvāja is among the authors of the runes of the brāhmanas (E.g., D.i.242; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479,Kālingabodhi Jātaka')"&gt;Kālingabodhi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; speaks of a Kālingabhāradvāja brahmin, while the brahmin carpenter in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/phandana_jat_475,Phandana Jātaka')"&gt;Phandana Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; belongs to the same clan.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purohita Sucīrata, of Dhanañjaya Koravya (in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhava_jat_515,Sambhava Jataka')"&gt;Sambhava Jataka&lt;/a&gt;), is a Bhāradvāja, as is also Jūjaka of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara_jat_547,Vessantara Jātaka')"&gt;Vessantara Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  In a Vinaya passage (Vin.iv.6; but see DA.iii.860) the Bhāradvājagotta is mentioned together with the Kosiya as a low clan (hīnagotta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Bhāradvāja.  &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin of the Bhāradvāja gotta living at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kammaasadamma,Kammāssadhamma')"&gt;Kammāssadhamma&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; once stayed there and slept on a mat in his fire hut, and there he met the Paribbājaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagandiya,Māgandiya')"&gt;Māgandiya&lt;/a&gt;.  M.i.501ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Bhāradvāja.  &lt;/b&gt; A yakkha chief to whom disciples of the Buddha should make appeal in time of need.  D.iii.204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Bhāradvāja&lt;/b&gt;.  A Pacceka Buddha.  M.iii.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhikkhādāyaka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a man of Rājagaha had just sat down to eat when he saw a monk, who had travelled far, standing outside his house.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emptied his food into the monk's bowl.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he died he was reborn in Tāvatimsa in a golden palace twelve yojanas in height.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahulikā, Bāhulikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heretical sect among the Buddhists, an offshoot or Gokulikā (Mhv.v.5; Mbv.p.97).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.v.41) calls the adherents of this sect Bahusuttakā.  According to Tibetan sources (Rockhill, p.183) they derived their name from their teacher, Bahusrutiya.  In addition to the five propositions held by the Mahāsanghikas, they considered it as a fundamental doctrine that there is no mode of life leading to real salvation, that the truth of suffering is the Noble Truth, that to perceive the suffering of the samskāras is to enter perfect purity, that there is no way of seeing the misery of suffering and the misery of change; the Sangha is but subject to worldly laws and conditions, arahants acquire the doctrine of others, there is a rightly preached way and a right entry into samāpatti.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Badalatthala, Badalatthalī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in the Dakkhinadesa of Ceylon (Cv.lviii.42; lxv.26).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the abode of the senāpati Sankha, who was killed there (Cv.lxiv.9).  Nearby was Pilimvatthu (Cv.lxv.4); it was to Badalatthala that the young Parakkamabāhu first came when he escaped from his custodians.  From there he went to Buddhagāma (Cv.lxvi.19), and later returned to Baddalatthala in order to meet his mother, Ratanāvalī, and the senāpati Deva, that he might visit his father with them (Cv.lxvii.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was an earth bound deva, and when, at the death of the Buddha, the earth trembled, he realized the Buddha's might and honoured him in his heart.  Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samita (Ap.i.151f).  He is probably identical with Meghiya Thera.  ThagA.i.149f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Buddhasaññaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Ninety four kappas ago he saw Siddhattha Buddha and his heart was gladdened.  Ap.i.252.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Buddhasaññaka.  &lt;/b&gt; A hermit in the time of Siddhattha Buddha.  Having heard from his pupils of the birth of the Buddha, he set forth from his hermitage to visit him.  But he fell ill while yet one hundred and fifty leagues away, and he died full of faith in the Buddha (Ap.ii.420).  He is probably identical with Vītasoka Thera.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahmadatta Jātaka (No.323)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, the Bodhisatta, after studying at Takkasilā, became an ascetic in the Himālaya, visited Uttarapañcāla, and resided in the garden of the Pañcāla king.  The king saw him begging for alms, invited him into the palace and, having shown him great honour, asked him to stay in the park.  When the time came for the Bodhisatta to return to the Himālaya, he wished for a pair of single soled shoes and a leaf parasol.  But for twelve years he could not summon up enough courage to ask the king for these things! He could only get as far as telling the king he had a favour to ask, and then his heart failed him, for, he said to himself, it made a man weep to have to ask and it made a man weep to have to refuse.  In the end the king noticed his discomfiture and offered him all his possessions; but the ascetic would take only the shoes and the parasol, and, with these, he left for the Himālaya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king is identified with Ananda.  J.iii.78ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Belatthasīsa Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant, preceptor of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;.  He was once afflicted with scurvy and his robes clung to him.  The monks thereupon applied water to the robes, but when the Buddha heard of it he made a rule allowing necessary therapeutic measures (Vin.i.202, 295f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one time this Thera would lie in the forest where he kept a store of dried boiled rice.  When he needed food, after samāpatti he would sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms.  When this was reported to the Buddha, he blamed Belatthasīsa for storing up food and promulgated a rule forbidding this (Vin.iv.86).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.171), however, states that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down, and, because the food was stored, not because of greed but through lack of covetousness, the Buddha declared Balatthasīsa free from guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belatthasīsa was a brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; who had left the world under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvela_kassapa,Uruvela Kassapa')"&gt;Uruvela Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; before the Buddha's Enlightenment and was converted when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been a monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, but could achieve no attainment.  He once gave a mātulunga fruit to Vessabhū Buddha (ThagA.i.67 ff.; Thag.vs.16).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m4_may,Mātulungaphaladāyaka')"&gt;Mātulungaphaladāyaka&lt;/a&gt; of the Apadāna.

Bhaddasāla.&lt;/b&gt; One of the chief disciples of Nārada Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.x.23).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a brahmin of Thullakotthita and, together with his friend Vijitamitta, he went in search of the Lake of Immortality (Amatarahada).  During their travels they met Nārada Buddha and entered the Order under him, later becoming arahants.  BuA.154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Bhaddasāla Thera&lt;/b&gt;.  An arahant.  He accompanied Mahinda to Ceylon (Mhv.xii.7; Dpv.xii.  12, 38; Sp.i.  62, 70).

Buddhamitta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; A colleague of Buddhaghosa and one of those at whose request he wrote the Jātakatthakathā (J.i.1; GV.  68).  He is also mentioned as having requested Buddhaghosa to write the Majjhima Commentary.  It is said that he lived with Buddhaghosa at the Mayūrarūpapattana.

Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Once Moggallāna and Lakkkhana saw a Bhikkhu, born as a peta, going through the air, his body, robes, etc., on fire.  He had been a sinful monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha.  S.ii.260.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhikkhu Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  A monk asks for a teaching in brief and the Buddha tells him that that for which a monk has bias, by that is he reckoned (i.e., he has to give up all bias).  The monk dwells in solitude, reflecting on this, and becomes an arahant.  S.iii.34f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhikkhu Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Ignorance consists in ignorance of the nature of the body, its arising, its cessation and the way thereto; wisdom is wisdom with regard to these things.  The same with the other khandhas.  S.iii.162f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bhikkhu Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Buddha agrees with a group of monks that if when questioned by other sectarians as to the object of their holiness, they answer that it is the full knowledge of dukkha, their answer is right; he proceeds to tell them what should be their answer if questioned as to what is dukkha.  S.iv.50f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells a monk about feelings, their arising and cause, their cessation and the way thereto, etc.  S.iv.232.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Bhikkhu Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk asks for a teaching in brief, and the Buddha tells him that he must have truly pure virtue and straight view.  Standing on sure virtue, he should cultivate the four satipatthānas; thus will he reach his goal.  The monk follows this teaching and becomes an arahant.  S.v.142f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Bhikku Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; It is by cultivating the four iddhi-pādas that a monk destroys the āsavas.  S.v.284.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.

From there the Buddha proceeded to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya,Pācīnavamsadāya')"&gt;Pācīnavamsadāya&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.350; M.iii.154; DhA.i.47; J.iii.489).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The readings of the texts are uncertain, and it is impossible to say whether a village (gāma) is meant or only a grove (ārāma).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reading Bālakalonakāragāma occurs in the Majjhima Commentary (MA.ii.596); but even here two explanations are given: one to the effect that Bālaka was the name of a village of salt makers (? lonakāragāma) belonging to Upāli phapati.  When the inhabitants of the village came to Upāli with their taxes, he went with them (bālakagāmavāsiniyā .  .  .  parisāya) to see Nigantha Nātaputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other explanation is that the word bālakiniyā in the text is an adjective meaning "composed of fools" (bālavatiyā bālussannāya) (Cp.,J.i.246, where mention is made of bālagāmikamanussā who were obviously fools).  The confusion seems, therefore, to have arisen very early.  Upāli's village (of Bāka), if such a place existed, was probably near Nālandā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The Buddha says it is unpleasant for him even to think of a place where monks are given to dispute, but far worse to go to it.  Strife is due to the abandonment of dispassionate, benevolent and harmless thinking.  Monks who dwell in harmony cultivate these things.  A.i.275f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhandana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Five disadvantages which come to those who encourage strife and disputes.  A.iii.252.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhandana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha rebukes some monks at Jetavana who were engaged in disputation and tells them to reflect on ten things which conduce to kindness, peace and concord.  A.v.88 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhātikābhaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called Bhātika or Bhātiya.  Son of Kutakannatissa and king of Ceylon for twenty eight years (38 66 A.C.).  He was called Bhātika or Bhātiya because he was the elder brother of Mahādāthika Mahānāga.  He was very pious, and once had the whole of the Mahā Thūpa covered with sandalwood paste in which were embedded sweet smelling flowers.  On another occasion he covered the whole thūpa with flowers and sprinkled them with water drawn by machines from the Abhaya-vāpi.  He made a plaster covering for the Mahā Thūpa into which were mixed many, cartloads of pearls.  A net of coral was made and thrown over the cetiya, and in its meshes were fastened lotus flowers of gold, as large as wagon wheels.  One day the king heard the sound of the chanting of arahants in the relic chamber of the Mahā Thūpa, and he lay down resolving not to rise until he had seen them.  The theras made a door by which he could enter, and, having seen the glories of the chamber, he described them for the benefit of the people, making figures in illustration of his descriptions.  Bhātikābhaya did many other works of merit, held Vesākha festivals, organized offerings for the Bodhi tree, and showed great hospitality to the monks at various places.  He was succeeded by his brother Mahādāthika Mahānāga (Mhv.xxxiv.38ff.; MT.553f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhātikābhaya once heard of a skilful judgment being given by Abhidhammika Godha Thera and laid down a rule that all disputes should be taken to the Elder for settlement (Sp.ii.307).  On another occasion he appointed a brahmin minister, named Dīghakārāyana, to settle a controversy between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahāvihāra (Sp.iii.583).  He had a queen called Sāmadevī who was the daughter of a cattle butcher.  A large number of cattle butchers were once brought before the king, but as they were unable to pay the fine demanded, he appointed them as scavengers in the palace.  One of them had a beautiful daughter, and the king fell in love with her and married her.  Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived in happiness (VibhA.440).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhātikābhaya once heard a Sutta (see A.v.21f ) in which the Buddha had declared that, of all perfumes, that of jasmine was the strongest.  In order to test this the king filled a room with the four kinds of perfume and then placed in it handfuls of various flowers, including jasmine.  He then left the room and shut the door.  After a while he entered again, and the first scent which greeted him was that of jasmine.  Convinced of the truth of the Buddha's statement, he fell prostrate and worshipped him (AA.ii.819).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.ii.180) that the king once asked a reciter to tell him of an auspicious stanza (jayamangala) connected with all the Three Jewels.  After thinking for a while, he recited the stanza beginning divā tapati ādicco, ratti ābhāti candimā (S.ii.284).  At the end of the first pāda, the reciter saluted the setting sun, at the end of the second the rising moon, at the end of the third the Sangha, and at the end of the stanza he stretched his hands upwards in salutation of the Mahā Thūpa.  The king asked him to hold his hands there and placed in them one thousand pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bindumatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A courtesan of Pātaliputta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was present when Asoka, sailing up the Ganges, asked his ministers and the people if there were any person who could make the river flow backwards.  Bindumatī performed an act of Truth (saccakiriyā) and the river rolled back.  Mil.121f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahmlakoka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest of the celestial worlds, the abode of the Brahmas.  It consists of twenty heavens: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the nine ordinary Brahma-worlds, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the five Suddhāvāsā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the four Arūpa worlds, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Asaññasatta and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Vehapphala (e.g., VibhA.521).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All except the four Arūpa worlds are classed among the Rūpa worlds (the inhabitants of which are corporeal).  The inhabitants of the Brahma worlds are free from sensual desires (but see the Mātanga Jātaka, J.iv.378, where Ditthamangalikā is spoken of as Mahābrahmabhariyā, showing that some, at least, considered that Mahābrahmas had wives).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahma world is the only world devoid of women (DhA.i.270); women who develop the jhānas in this world can be born among the Brahmapārisajjā (see below), but not among the Mahābrahmas (VibhA.437f).  Rebirth in the Brahma world is the result of great virtue accompanied by meditation (Vsm.415).  The Brahmas, like the other celestials, are not necessarily sotāpanna or on the way to complete knowledge (sambodhi-parāyanā); their attainments depend on the degree of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.  See, e.g., A.iv.76f.; it is not necessary to be a follower of the Buddha for one to be born in the Brahma world; the names of six teachers are given whose followers were born in that world as a result of listening to their teaching (A.iii.371ff.; iv.135ff.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātakas contain numerous accounts of ascetics who practised meditation, being born after death in the Brahma world (e.g., J.ii.43, 69, 90; v.98, etc.).  Some of the Brahmas - e.g., Baka (q.v.) - held false views regarding their world, which, like all other worlds, is subject to change and destruction (M.i.327).  When the rest of the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Brahma world is saved (Vsm.415; KhpA.121), and the first beings to be born on earth come from the Ābhassara Brahma world (Vsm.417).  Buddhas and their more eminent disciples often visit the Brahma worlds and preach to the inhabitants.  E.g., M.i.326 f.; ThagA.ii.184ff.; Sikhī Buddha and Abhibhū are also said to have visited the Brahma world (A.i.227f.).  The Buddha could visit it both in his mind made body and his physical body (S.v.282f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a rock as big as the gable of a house were to be dropped from the lowest Brahma-world it would take four months to reach the earth travelling one hundred thousand leagues a day.  Brahmas subsist on trance, abounding in joy (sappītikajjhāna), this being their sole food.  SA.i.161; food and drinks are offered to Mahābrahmā, and he is invited to partake of these, but not of sacrifices (SA.i.158 f.).  Anāgāmins, who die before attaining arahantship, are reborn in the Suddhāvāsā Brahma-worlds and there pass away entirely (see, e.g., S.i.35, 60, and Compendium v.10).  The beings born in the lowest Brahma world are called Brahma-pārisajjā; their life term is one third of an asankheyya kappa; next to them come the Brahma-purohitā, who live for half an asankheyya kappa; and beyond these are the Mahā Brahmas who live for a whole asankheyya kappa (Compendium, v.6; but see VibhA.519f., where Mahā Brahmās are defined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term Brahmakāyikā-devā seems to be used as a classs-name for all the inhabitants of the Brahma-worlds (A.i.210; v.76f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahā Niddesa Commentary (p.109) says that the word includes all the five (?) kinds of Brahmā (sabbe pi pañca vokāra Brahmāno gahitā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BuA.p.10 thus defines the word Brahmā: brūhito tehi tehi gunavisesahī ti=Brahmā.  Ayam pana Brahmasaddo Mahā-Brahma-brāhmana-Thathāgata mātāpitu-setthādisu dissati.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantapāsādikā (i.131) speaks of a Mahā Brahmā who was a khināsava, living for sixteen thousand kappas.  When the Buddha, immediately after his birth, looked around and took his steps northward, it was this Brahmā who seized the babe by his finger and assured him that none was greater than he.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The names of several Brahmās occur in the books - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tudu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nārada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghatikāra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baka&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sanankumāra&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sahampatī&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To these should be added the names of seven Anāgāmīs resident in Avihā and other Brahma worlds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upaka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phalagandu, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pukkusāti, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bhaddiya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Khandadeva, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bāhuraggi and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pingiya (S.i.35, 60; SA.i.72 etc.).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka speaks of seventy two Brahmās, living, apparently, in his world, as his companions (S.i.142).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Tissa Brahmā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are described as Mahā Brahmās.  Mention is also made of Pacceka Brahmās - e.g., Subrahmā and Suddhavāsa (S.i.146f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tudu is also sometimes described as a Pacceka Brahmā (e.g., S.i.149).  Of the Pacceka Brahmās, Subrahmā and Suddhavāsa are represented as visiting another Brahmā, who was infatuated with his own power and glory, and as challenging him to the performance of miracles, excelling him therein and converting him to the faith of the Buddha.  Tudu is spoken of as exhorting Kokālika to put his trust in Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Loc.  Cit.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No explanation is given of the term Pacceka Brahmā.  Does it mean Brahmās who dwelt apart, by themselves? Cp.  Pacceka-Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmās are represented as visiting the earth and taking an interest in the affairs of men.  Thus, Nārada descends from the Brahma-world to dispel the heresies of King Angati (J.vi.242f).  When the Buddha hesitates to preach his doctrine, because of its profundity, it is Sahampati (q.v.) who visits him and begs him to preach it for the welfare of the world.  The explanation given (e.g., at SA.i.155) is that the Buddha waited for the invitation of Sahampati that it might lend weight to his teaching.  The people were followers of Brahmā, and Sahampati's acceptance of the Buddha's leadership would impress them deeply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sahampatī is mentioned as visiting the Buddha several times subsequently, illuminating Jetavana with the effulgence of his body.  It is said that with a single finger he could illuminate a whole Cakkavāla (SA.i.158).  Sanankumāra (q.v.) was also a follower of the Buddha.  The Brahmās appear to have been in the habit of visiting the deva worlds too, for Sanankumāra is reported as being present at an assembly of the Tāvatimsa gods and as speaking there the Buddha's praises and giving an exposition of his teaching.  But, in order to do this, he assumed the form of Pañcasikha (D.ii.211ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books refer (e.g., at D.i.18, where Brahmā is described as vasavattī issaro kattā nimmātā, etc.) to the view held, at the Buddha's time, of Brahmā as the creator of the universe and of union with Brahmā as the highest good, only to be attained by prayers and sacrifices.  But the Buddha himself did not hold this view amid does not speak of any single Brahmā as the highest being in all creation.  See, however, A.v.59f., where Mahā Brahmā, is spoken of as the highest denizen of the Sahassalokadhātu (yāvatā sahassalokadhātu, Mahā-Brahmā tattha aggam akkhāyati); but he, too, is impermanent (Mahā-Brahmūno pi .  .  .  atthi eva aññathattam, atthi viparināmo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are Mahā Brahmās, mighty and powerful (abhibhū anabhibhūto aññadatthudaso vasavattī), but they too, all of them, and their world are subject to the laws of Kamma.  E.g., at S.v.410 (Brahmaloko pi āvuso anicco adhuvo sakkāyapariyāpanno sādhāyasmā Brahmalokā cittam vutthāpetvā sakkāyanirodhacittam upasamharāhi).  See also A.iv.76f., 104f., where Sunetta, in spite of all his great powers as Mahā Brahmā, etc., had to confess himself still subject to suffering.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Buddha, union with Brahmā seems to have meant being associated with him in his world, and this can only be attained by cultivation of those qualities possessed by the Brahmā.  But the highest good lay beyond, in the attainment of Nibbāna.  Thus in the Tevijjā Sutta; see also M.ii.194f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word Brahma is often used in compounds meaning highest and best - e.g., Brahmacariyā, Brahmassara; for details see Brahma in the New Pāli Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bandhula&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of a chieftain of the &lt;b&gt;Mallas&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;b&gt;Kusinārā&lt;/b&gt;.  He studied at &lt;b&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;Mahāli&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/b&gt;.  On his return home, he wished to give an exhibition of his skill, and the princely families of the Mallas bound sticks of bamboo in bundles of sixty, inserting a strip of iron in each bundle; they then suspended the bundles in the air and challenged Bandhula to cut them down.  He leapt up in the air and smote them with his sword, but on discovering the treachery of his kinsmen, he threatened to kill them all; his parents, however, dissuaded him, and he went to live in Sāvatthi, where Pasenadi appointed him Senāpati.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula's wife was &lt;b&gt;Mallikā&lt;/b&gt; (known as &lt;b&gt;Bandhula&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mallikā&lt;/b&gt; in order to distinguish her from the wife of Pasenadi).  As she bore no children, Bandhula wished to send her back to her people; but when she went to bid farewell to the Buddha before her departure, he asked her to return to her husband.  He accepted her, thereby showing his faith in the Buddha.  Soon after she conceived a child, and her pregnancy longing was to enter the lotus tank used by the princes of &lt;b&gt;Vesāli&lt;/b&gt; on their coronation and to drink its water.  Bandhula took her to Vesāli, drove away the strong guards who were posted at the lotus tank, and let Mallikā enjoy it to her heart's content.  When the &lt;b&gt;Licchavi&lt;/b&gt; princes heard of this, they were greatly enraged and pursued Bandhula's chariot, in spite of the warning of Mahāli.  When the chariots of the Licchavis came into line, Bandhula, in order to frighten them, twanged his bow; but as they still pursued him, he shot a single arrow, which pierced each of the five hundred Licchavis through his girdle without their being aware of the wound.  Bandhula told them of their plight; but they refused to believe him until they loosed the girdle of the foremost and he fell down dead.  Thereupon they returned to their homes, bade farewell to their families, and fell dead on the moment of loosening their armour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mallikā bore twin sons sixteen times; each of them became perfect in the various arts, and each had a retinue of one thousand men.  One day, Bandhula retried a case, which had been unjustly decided by the judge and his decision was greatly applauded.  The king, hearing the applause and learning the reason, appointed him judge.  It is probably this incident, which is referred to at S.i.74 (&lt;b&gt;Atthakarana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;); see also KS.i.101, n.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the former judges poisoned the king's mind against Bandhula, and the king, listening to them, sent Bandhula and his sons to quell a frontier rebellion, giving orders that they should all be murdered on the way home.  This was done, and the news of the massacre was brought to Mallikā while she was entertaining five hundred monks led by the two Chief Disciples (according to MA.ii.753 the Buddha was also present).  Mallikā read the message, and placing it in a fold of her dress, went on with her duties.  &lt;b&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/b&gt; discovered her fortitude at the end of the meal and greatly praised her.  Mallikā sending for her daughters in law, broke the news to them, urging them to harbour no resentment against the king.  The king's spies, discovering this, brought the news to Pasenadi.  The king was greatly moved, and having sent for Mallikā, begged her forgiveness and granted her a boon.  She chose as her boon that she and her thirty two daughters in law should be allowed to return home to &lt;b&gt;Kusinārā&lt;/b&gt;.  Bandhula's nephew, &lt;b&gt;Dīghakārāyāna&lt;/b&gt;, was appointed commander-in chief, but he never forgave the injury to Bandhula, and, in the end, brought about Pasenadi's deposition and consequent death (DhA.i.228f., 349 56; J.iv.148 ff.; MA.ii.753f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula isi sometimes referred to as &lt;b&gt;Bandhulamalla&lt;/b&gt;.  (E.g., J.iv.148.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandhula's wife, Mallikā, was one of the three persons possessing the &lt;b&gt;Mahālatāpasādhana&lt;/b&gt;, the others being &lt;b&gt;Visākhā&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Devadāniyacora&lt;/b&gt; (but see DhA.i.412, where the daughter of Bārānasīsetthi is substituted for Devadāniya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time of her husband's death Mallikā laid aside the pasādhana, but, on the day on which the Buddha's body was being removed for cremation, she washed the pasādhana in perfumed water and placed it on the body, which it completely covered.  She expressed the wish that, as long as she remained in samsāra, her body should need no ornament.  DA.ii.597.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The Bodhisatta born as the king of Roruva and husband of Samuddavijayā.  For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aaditta_jat_424,Āditta Jātaka')"&gt;Āditta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  J.iii.470 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bharata&lt;/b&gt;.  A hunter who brought from the Himālaya the chief of a herd of monkeys whose cry was one of the noises mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthasadda_jat,Atthasadda Jātaka')"&gt;Atthasadda Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (q.v.).  J.iii.432.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bharata Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was a householder of Campā, and, having heard that Sona Kolivisa had left the world, he, too, with his brother, Nandaka, entered the Order, soon afterwards becoming an arahant.  Later, he helped his more slow witted brother to obtain insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past Bharata gave to Anomadassi Buddha a pair of comfortable and very beautiful sandals.  Thag.vss.175, 176; ThagA.i.300f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bharata&lt;/b&gt;.  King of the Sovīras in the time of Renu.  His capital was in Roruva.

A king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to the dynasty of Okkāka.  He was the father of Dasaratha (q.v.).  MT.  130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Bharata&lt;/b&gt;.  A scion of the Mahāsammata race and son of Sāgaradeva.  He was the father of Angīrasa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buddhadāsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon for twenty nine years (between 362 and 409 A.C.) He was the son of Jetthatissa and led a very pious life.  He was renowned as a great physician, and various miraculous cures are attributed to him, even snakes seeking his assistance.  A jewel, which he received from a snake in gratitude for a cure, he placed in the stone image in the Abhayagiri vihāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medical work, the Sāratthasangaha, in Sanskrit, is ascribed to him (but see Cv.  Trs.  13, n.  7).  It is said that he appointed a royal physician for every ten villages, and established hospitals for the crippled and for the dumb and also for animals.  He appointed preachers to look after the people's spiritual welfare.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among religious buildings erected by him was the Moraparivena.  He extended his patronage to a holy monk, named Mahādhammakathī, who translated the suttas into Singhalese.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhadāsa had eighty sons, named after the Buddha's eminent disciples, the eldest being Upatissa II.  who succeeded him.  Cv.xxxvii.105ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Buddhadāsa&lt;/b&gt;.-A pious man of Tundagāma.  He drove away a Yakkha who had taken possession of a friend of his.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bharandukālāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recluse, once a co-disciple of the Buddha in the holy life.  Once, when the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu and wanted lodging for the night, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanama_th,Mahānāma')"&gt;Mahānāma&lt;/a&gt; suggested that he should go to the hermitage of Bharandu.  The Buddha acted on this suggestion and spent the night there.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mahānāma arrived the next morning, the Buddha talked to him about the three kinds of teachers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;those who have full comprehension of sense desires only but not of objects of sense or of feelings; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;those who have full comprehension of sense desires and of objects of sense; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;those who have comprehension of all three.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would their conclusions coincide, or would they differ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here Bharandu chimed in and asked Mahānāma to say they would be the same.  But the Buddha contradicted him, whereupon Bharandu said they would be different; but the Buddha again contradicted him, and even, also, a third time.  Grieved at being slighted by the Buddha in the presence of Mahānāma, an important &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya,Sākiyan')"&gt;Sākiyan&lt;/a&gt;, Bharandu left &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, never to return (A.i.276 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (AA.i.458) that he had lived in the same hermitage as the Buddha, when they were both pupils of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalara_kaalaama,Alārakālama')"&gt;Alārakālama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharandu had the reputation of being able to secure the best and choicest alms in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddaji Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a setthi in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya,Bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt;.  He was worth eighty crores, and was brought up in luxury like that of the Bodhisatta in his last birth.  When Bhaddaji was grown up, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; came to Bhaddiya to seek him out, and stayed at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana,Jātiyāvana')"&gt;Jātiyāvana&lt;/a&gt; with a large number of monks.  Thither Bhaddaji went to hear him preach.  He became an arahant, and, with his father's consent, was ordained by the Buddha.  Seven weeks later he accompanied the Buddha to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kotigaama,Kotigāma')"&gt;Kotigāma&lt;/a&gt;, and, while the Buddha was returning thanks to a pious donor on the way, Bhaddaji retired to the bank of the Ganges outside the village, where he stood wrapt in jhāna, emerging only when the Buddha came by, not having heeded the preceding chief theras.  He was blamed for this; but, in order to demonstrate the attainments of Bhaddaji, the Buddha invited him to his own ferry boat and bade him work a wonder.  Bhaddaji thereupon raised from the river bed, fifteen leagues into the air, a golden palace twenty leagues high, in which he had lived as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada,Mahāpanāda')"&gt;Mahāpanāda&lt;/a&gt;.  On this occasion the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m2_mahap,Mahāpanāda')"&gt;Mahāpanāda&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suruci_jat_489,Suruci Jātaka')"&gt;Suruci Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; was preached.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavamsa,Mahāvamsa')"&gt;Mahāvamsa&lt;/a&gt; account (xxxi.37ff) says that, before raising Mahāpanada's palace, Bhaddaji rose into the air to the height of seven palmyra trees, holding the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dussa_thuupa,Dussa Thūpa')"&gt;Dussa Thūpa&lt;/a&gt; from the Brahma world in his hand.  He then dived into the Ganges and returned with the palace.  The brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanduttara,Nanduttara')"&gt;Nanduttara&lt;/a&gt;, whose hospitality the Buddha and his monks had accepted, saw this miracle of Bhaddaji, and himself wished for similar power by which he might procure relics in the possession of others.  He was reborn as the novice &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sonuttara,Sonuttara')"&gt;Sonuttara&lt;/a&gt;, who obtained the relics for the thūpas of Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, Bhaddaji was a brahmin ascetic who, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, offered him honey, lotus stalks, etc.  Soon after he was struck by lightning and reborn in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tusita,Tusita')"&gt;Tusita&lt;/a&gt;.  In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"&gt;Vipassī&lt;/a&gt; Buddha he was a very rich setthi and fed sixty eight thousand monks, to each of whom he gave three robes.  Later, he ministered to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas.  In a subsequent birth his son was a Pacceka Buddha, and he looked after him and built a cetiya over his remains after his death.  Thag.vs.163f.; ThagA.i.285ff.; also J.ii.331ff., where the details vary slightly; J.iv.325; also MT.560f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddaji is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumana,Sumana')"&gt;Sumana&lt;/a&gt; of the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544,Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka')"&gt;Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.255).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Bhisadāyaka of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/apadaana,Apadāna')"&gt;Apadāna&lt;/a&gt; (Ap.ii.420f).  Bhaddaji is mentioned among those who handed down the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhamma_pitaka,Abhidhamma')"&gt;Abhidhamma&lt;/a&gt; to the Third Council (DhSA.32).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_s,Bhaddaji Sutta')"&gt;Bhaddaji Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

In the past, while gathering lotus stalks for food, he saw Padumuttara Buddha travelling through the air and asked him to accept some stalks.  The Buddha did so.  Soon after, the man was struck by lightning and reborn in Tusita (Ap.ii.420f).  He is probably identical with Bhaddaji Thera.  ThagA.i.286.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhisadāyaka Thera.&lt;/b&gt; An arahant.  Thirty one kappas ago he was an elephant, and seeing Vessabhū Buddha in the forest, he gave him lotus stalks to eat.  Thirteen kappas ago he was born sixteen times as king under the name of Samodhāna.  Ap.i.114.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bherī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A female ascetic who was often invited to the palace of King Videha, where she heard of the wisdom of Mahosadha and wished to meet him.  One day she met him on her way to the palace and questioned him by means of dumb signs, to which Mahosadha replied in the same way.  Queen Nandās confidantes saw this, and reported to the king that Mahosadha and Bherī were conspiring to kill him.  But the king questioned each of the two separately, and, satisfied with their innocence, appointed Mahosadha commander in chief (J.vi.467f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bherī is identified with Uppalavannā (J.vi.478).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhadrāvudha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sixteen disciples of Bāvarī, who, at his request, visited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; (SN.vs.1008).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He questioned the Buddha as to how a man could get over attachment and cross the flood.  By grasping after nothing in the world, answered the Buddha, for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt; follows the man who clings to things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question and answer are contained in the Bhadrāvudhamānava-puccha (SN.vs.1101-4), which is explained in the Culla Niddesa (CNid.36f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse, Bhadrāvudha and his pupils became arahants and joined the Order.  SNA.ii.599.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bakabrahma Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relates the story of the Buddha's visit to Baka and the conversation between Baka and the Buddha on that occasion.  The incidents of Baka's previous life are referred to but without detail (S.i.142 f).  Cp.  Brahmanimantika Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta cannot be identical with the Bakabrahma Sutta mentioned in Theragāthā Commentary and quoted there in full (ii.  185 f).  It is stated there that once when the Buddha was at Jetavana a certain Brahmā conceived the view that no monk or recluse could come to his world.  The Buddha, aware of this, went to the Brahma world and stood in the air enveloped in flame.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was followed by Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina and Anuruddha.  Moggallāna asked the Brahmā if he still held the same view, to which he replied that he no longer thought that he was eternal.  (This shows that the Brahmā of the story was most probably Baka.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha and his followers had departed, the Brahmā sent one of his retinue to Moggallāna to find out if there were other disciples of the Buddha as mighty as he.  Moggallāna's answer was that there were many such (the sutta is given at S.i.144 ff., but there the name given is “Aparāditthi” Sutta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddasāla Jātaka (No.465)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brahmadatta, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, wishing to have a palace built on one column, sent his carpenters to find a suitable tree.  They found many such in the forest, but no road by which to transport them.  At last they discovered a lordly sāla tree in the king's park and made preparations to cut it down.  The deity of the tree (Bhaddasāla 2), who was the Bodhisatta, was greatly distressed at the prospect of the destruction of his children.  He, therefore, visited the king by night and begged him not to have the tree cut down.  When the king refused this request, Bhaddasāla asked that the tree should be cut down in pieces, so that in its fall it might not damage its kindred round about.  This feeling of Bhaddasāla for his kinsmen touched the king, and he desisted from his purpose of destroying the tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's interference with Vidūdabha (q.v.) when he wished to destroy the Sākyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda is identified with the king (J.iv.153 7).  On this occasion was preached also the Kukkura Jātaka (No.22), the Kāka Jātaka (No.140), and the Mahākapi Jātaka (No.407).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhīmasena Jātaka (No.80)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a very skilful archer, educated at Takkasilā and famed as Culla Dhanuggaha.  He was a crooked little dwarf and, lest he should be refused employment on account of his size, he persuaded a tall, well built weaver, called Bhīmasena, to be his stalking horse.  Bhīmasena went with him to the king of Benares and obtained the post of royal archer.  Once, the kingdom was attacked by a tiger and Bhīmasena was sent to kill it.  Following the advice of the Bodhisatta, he went with a large band of country men, and when the tiger was sighted he waited in a thicket and lay flat on his face.  When he knew that the tiger had been killed, he came out of the thicket trailing a creeper in his hand and blamed the people, saying that he had meant to lead the tiger like an ox to the king and had gone into the wood to find a creeper for that purpose.  "Who has killed the tiger and spoilt all my plans?" he asked.  "I will report all of you to the king." The terrified people bribed him heavily and said no word as to who had killed the tiger.  The king, believing that Bhīmasena himself had killed it, rewarded him handsomely.  The same thing happened with a buffalo.  Bhīmasena grew rich and began to neglect the Bodhisatta.  Soon after, a hostile king marched on Benares.  Bhīmasena went with a large army riding on an elephant, the Bodhisatta behind him, but at the sight of the battlefield Bhīmasena was so terrified that he fouled the elephant's back.  The Bodhisatta taunted him and sent him home, while he himself captured the enemy king and brought him to the king of Benares, who showed him all honour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a monk who, although of low family, used to boast of that family's greatness.  The truth was discovered and his pretensions exposed.  He is identified with Bhīmasena.  J.i.355-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhaya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; There are three terrors that part mother and son: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a great fire, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a great flood, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a raid by robbers.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also parted by old age, disease, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice of the Noble Eightfold Path will avoid these terrors.  A.i.178 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhaya Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt;"Fear" is a name for sense desires; likewise "pain," "disease," "blain," "bondage" and "bog." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impassioned by the senses and bound by them, both in this world and in the next, men are subject to fear, etc.  A.iii.310f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhaya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The same as No.2, with the addition of "womb" to the list.  A.iii.311.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhaya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  There are four fears: birth, old age, disease, and death.  A.ii.121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bhaya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Four other fears: fire, water, kings, bandits.  A.ii.121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Bhaya or Bhikkhu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  In the Ariyan disciple the five kinds of guilty dread are allayed; he is possessed by the four limbs of sotāpanna, and the Ariyan method is, by him, well seen and penetrated by insight.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bāhiya Jātaka (No.108)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Brahmadatta, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, saw from his window a fat and badly dressed woman relieving nature modestly and decently as she passed the courtyard of the palace when pressing need came upon her.  The king was pleased with her quickness and decency, and having sent for her made her his chief queen.  Their son became a Cakkavatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the fat wife of a Licchavi prince.  The monks expressed surprise that he should love her, but the Buddha pointed out that she was healthy and cleanly in her house (J.i.420 ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of the Jātaka, the woman is referred to as a bāhiyā, which the scholiast explains by bahijanapadavāsī.

He captured Kosala and murdered its king Dīghiti and Dīghiti's wife, but made peace later with Dīghiti's son, Dīghāvu, restored to him his father's kingdom, and gave him his own daughter in marriage.  Vin.i.342ff.; DhA.i.56f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Brahmadatta.  &lt;/b&gt; King of the Assakas and friend of Renu.  When Mahāgovinda divided Jambudīpa into seven equal portions for Renu and his six friends, Brahmadatta was given the kingdom, of the Assakas, with Potama as his capital.  D.ii.235f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Brahmadatta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; In the Jātaka Commentary this is given as the name of numerous kings of Benares.  In most cases we are told nothing further of them than that they reigned at Benares at the time of the incidents related in the story.  Brahmadatta, was probably the dynastic name of the kings of Benares.  Thus, for instance, in the Gangamāla Jātaka (J.iii.452) Udaya, king of Benares, is addressed as Brahmadatta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gandatindu Jātaka (J.v.102-106) however, Pañcāla, king of Uttarapañcāla, is also called Brahmadatta; in this case it was evidently his personal name.  It was also the name of the husband of Pingiyāni (q.v.).  He was a king, but we are not told of what country.  He is identified (J.v.444) with Kunāla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Brahmadatta Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; He was the son of the king of Kosala, and, having witnessed the Buddha's majesty at the consecration of Jetavana, he entered the Order and in due course became an arahant.  One day, while going for alms, he was abused by a brahmin, but kept silence.  Again and again the brahmin abused him, and the people marvelled at the patience of Brahmadatta, who then preached to them on the wisdom of not returning abuse for abuse.  The brahmin was much moved and entered the Order under Brahmadatta.  Thag.  vs.  441 6; ThagA.i.460ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Brahmadatta.&lt;/b&gt; Head of a dynasty of thirty six kings, all of whom ruled at Hatthipura.  His ancestors ruled at Kapilanagara.  MT.  127; Dpv.iii.18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Brahmadatta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; A Pacceka Buddha.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he had been a monk and had lived in the forest for twenty thousand years.  He was then born as the son of the king of Benares.  When his father died he became king, ruling over twenty thousand cities with Benares as the capital, but, wishing for quiet, he retired into solitude in the palace.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife tired of him and committed adultery with a minister who was banished on the discovery of his offence.  He then took service under another king and persuaded him to attack Brahmadatta.  Brahmadatta's minister, much against his will, and having promised not to take life, made a sudden attack on the enemy and drove them away.  Brahmadatta, seated on the field of battle, developed thoughts of metā and became a Pacceka Buddha.  SNA.i.58ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Brahmadatta.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin, father of Kassapa Buddha.  J.i.43; Bu.xxv.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Brahmadatta.&lt;/b&gt; Pupil of the Paribbājaka Suppiya.  A conversation between these two led to the preaching of the Brahmajāla Sutta.  D.i.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Brahmadatta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk, sometimes credited with having supplied the illustrations to the aphorisms in Kaccāyama's grammar.  P.L.C.  180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to a being who aspires to Bodhi or Enlightenment.  The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.427) define the word thus: Bodhisatto ti panditasatto bujjhanakasatto; bodhisankhātesu vā catusu maggesu āsatto laggamānaso ti Bodhisatto.  See also AA.i.453. For a discussion of the meaning of the word see Har Dayal: The Bodhisativa Doctrine, pp.4ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word can therefore be used in reference to all those who seek Nibbāna, including Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and the disciples of Buddhas (Buddha-paccekabuddha-buddha-sāvakā), but is commonly used only of those beings who seek to become Buddhas.  The word may have been used originally only in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as "in the days before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisatta”.  E.g., M.i.17, 114, 163; so also in the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.13) and the Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But already in the Kathāvatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, a Bodhisatta's career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhinīhārakarana or mūlapanidhāna) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures.  In later literature, the abhinīhāra is preceded by a period during which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the abhinīhāra to be effective, eight conditions should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f.  and SNA.i.48f): the aspirant should be &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) a human being, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) a male, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that very birth, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) a recluse at the time of the declaration, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(6) should be possessed of attainments such as the jhānas, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and unwavering.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhinīhāra was made at Amaravātī in the presence of Dīpankara Buddha.  His name at that time was Sumedha (q.v.).  The Buddha, before whom the abhinīhāra is made, looks into the future and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the particulars of such fulfilment.  This declaration is called vyākarana, and is made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his career.  Having received his first vyākarana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of Buddhahood (buddhakārakadhammā), in accordance with the custom of previous Bodhisattas.  These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasapārami):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dāna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sīla, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nekkhamma, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;paññā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;viriya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;khanti, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sacca, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;aditthāna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mettā and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;upekhā.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bu.ii.116ff.  Sometimes thirty pāramī are spoken of, each of the ten being divided into three, varying in kind and degree.  Thus, in the case of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dāna, the dānapārami consists in giving one's limbs,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dāna upapārami in giving away one's external possessions and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dānapāramatthapāramī in giving one's life, this last being the most excellent.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, examples of births in which the ten pārami were practised to the highest degree are as follows: the Ekarāja, Khantivādī, Cūlla-Sankhapāla, Mahājanaka, Mahāsutasoma, Mūgapakkha, Lomahamsa, Sattubhattaka, Sasa, and Sutasoma Jātakas (BuA.  50; J.i.44f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also develops the four Buddhabhūmi (catasso buddhabhūmiyo) - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ussāha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ummagga, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;avatthāna and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hitacariyā - &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;explained respectively as zealousness (viriya), wisdom (paññā), resolution (adhitthāna) and compassion (mettābhāvanā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cultivates the six ajjhāsayas which conduce to the maturing of Enlightenment (bodhiparipākiyā samvattanti), these six being: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;nekkhammajjhāsaya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pavivekajjhāsaya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;alobhajjhāsaya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;adosajjhāsaya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;amohajjhāsaya and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nissaravajjhāsaya.  SNA.i.50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bodhisatta, during his career, escapes from being born in eighteen inauspicious states (atthārasa abhabbatthānāni).  He is never born blind, deaf, insane, slobbery (elamūga) or crippled, or among savages (milakkkesu), in the womb of a slave, or as a heretic.  He never changes his sex, is never guilty of any of the five ānantarikakammas, and never becomes a leper.  If born as an animal, he never becomes less than a quail or more than an elephant.  He is never born either among various classes of petas nor among the Kālakañjakas, neither in Avīci nor in the lokantaraka nirayas, neither as Māra, nor in worlds where there is no perception (asaññibhava), nor in the Suddhāvāsas, nor in the Arūpa worlds, nor ever in another Cakkavāla.  SNA.i.50 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides practising the (thirty) pārami, all Bodhisattas must make the five great sacrifices (mahāpariccāgā) - giving up &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;wife, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;children, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;kingdom, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;life and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limb (J.vi.552) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and must fulfil the three kinds of conduct (cariyā) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ñātatthacariyā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lokatthacariyā and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;buddhiatthacariyā &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the seven mahādanas as practised by Vessantara, which caused the earth to quake seven times.  DA.ii.427; DhA.iii.441; the BuA.  (116 f.) gives a story about Mangala Buddha which corresponds to that of Vessantara in regard to Gotama Buddha.  See Kharadāthika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The length of a Bodhisatta's career varies; some practice the pāramī for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas.  The first of these periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel in wisdom (paññā).  The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddhā); and the last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) (SNA.i.47 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span.  Vipassī, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the time for the announcement of their last birth approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten thousand world systems.  The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the Buddha.  The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great Investigations (pañcamahāvilokanā) regarding time, continent, place of birth, his mother and the life span left to her.  Buddhas do not appear in the world when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one hundred.  They are born only in Jambudīpa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a khattiya or brahmin clan.  The Bodhisatta's mother in his last birth must not be passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the pārami for one hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception of the Bodhisatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while playing.  On the day of his conception, the Bodhisatta's mother takes the vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury.  As she lies there the Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right side.  The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with radiance.  Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child.  Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436).  At the end of the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors.  Suddhāvāsa brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin and present him to his mother.  Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water - one hot, the other cold - fall from the sky and bathe mother and child.  The child then takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth.  (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, spoke, in three different births, as soon as born - as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, J.i.53).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven days after birth his mother dies.  She dies because she must bear no other being.  The Bodhisatta's time of conception is so calculated that the mother's destined life span completes itself seven days after his birth.  From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would appear that the age of the Bodhisatta's mother at the time of his birth is between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotthāsā atikkamma tatiyekotthāse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta's last birth is attended by various miracles.  The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the Bodhisatta's last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child's body the thirty two marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisa), (for details of these see D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f.  The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha.  His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha, brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the world.  But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a Recluse.  In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., Vipassī) these four signs (nimittāni as they are called) are seen by them at different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son's birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant (e.g., Dīpankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, Sikhī and Konāgamana), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;some on a chariot (e.g., Kondañña, Revata, Paduma, Piyadassī, and Kakusandha), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;some on a horse (e.g., Mangala, Sujāta, Atthadassī, Tissa, Gotama), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;some in a palanquin (e.g., Anomadassī, Siddhattha and Vessabhū).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some, like Nārada, go on foot, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;while Sobhita, Dhammadassī and Kassapa travelled in the palaces of their lay life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of Dīpankara, Kondañña, Sumana, Anomadassī, Sujāta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Mangala, Sumedha, Tissa and Sikhī it was eight; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Revata seven; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Piyadassī, Phussa, Vessabhū and Konāgamana six; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Sobhita four; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Paduma, Atthadassī and Vipassī two weeks; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Nārada, Padumuttara, Dhammadassī and Kassapa one week; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and for Gotama six years (for the reason for this great length in the last case, see Gotama).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the Bodhisatta attains to Buddhahood, he receives a meal of milk rice (pāyāsa) from a woman and a gift of kusagrass, generally from an Ājīvīka, which he spreads under the Bodhi-tree (the Bodhi tree is different for each Bodhisatta) for his seat.  The size of this seat varies;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the seats of Dīpankara, Revata, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī and Vipassī were fifty-three hands in length; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;those of Kondañña, Mangala, Nārada and Sumedha fifty seven hands; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;that of Sumana sixty hands; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;those of Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Padumuttara and Phussa thirty eight; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of Sujāta thirty two; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of Kakusandha twenty six; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of Konāgamana twenty; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of Kassapa fifteen; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;of Gotama fourteen (BuA.  247).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great dreams: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(1) that the world is his couch with the Himālaya as his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the western, and his feet on the southern; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(2) that a blade of tiriyā(kusa) grass growing from his navel touches the clouds; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his feet, covering his knees; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(4) that four birds of varied hues from the four quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by which he remains unsoiled.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.; these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal.  The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but Māra (q.v.) comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee.  All day, the fight continues between Māra and the Bodhisatta; the pārami alone are present to lend their aid to the Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while Māra and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory.  Meanwhile the Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samuppāda doctrine.  Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation and twelve times the earth trembles.  With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his udānā of victory, while the whole world rejoices with him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Paticca-Samuppada see D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is given.  DA.ii.462ff gives similar details regarding Vipassī; BuA.248 says it is the same for all Bodhisattas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above is a brief account, as given in the books, of certain features common to all Bodhisattas.  In addition to these, particulars of the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in the Buddhavamsa and the Jātakatthakathā.  It has already been stated that each Bodhisatta receives the vyākarana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama was no exception.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He received his first vyākarana as the ascetic Sumedha, from Dīpankara; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and then, as a cakkavatti, from Kondañña; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the brahmin Suruci, from Mangala; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the Nāga king Atula, from Sumana; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the brahmin Atideva, from Revata; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the brahmin Ajita, from Sobhita; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a yakkha chief, from Anomadassī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a lion, from Paduma; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as an ascetic (isi) from Nārada; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a governor (Mahāratthiya) Jatila, from Padumuttara; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the youth Uttara, from Sumedha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a Cakkavatti, from Sujāta; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the youth Kassapa, from Piyadassī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the ascetic Susīma, from Atthadassī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as Sakka, from Dhammadassī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as the ascetic Mangala, from Siddhattha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;as Sujāta, from Tissa;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ājīvaka (Lomahamsa Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ascetic (numerous births); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;barber (Illīsa Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;caravan leader (Kimpakka and Mahāvānija Jātakas);

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;courtier (Bāhayi, Sālittaka, etc., Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dice player (Litta Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;drummer (Bherivāda Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;elephant trainer (Sangāmāvacara Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;farmer (Kañcanakkhandha, Kummāsapinda, Sīhacamma, Suvannakakkata Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;forester (Khurappa Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;gardener (Kuddālaka Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;goldsmith (Kunāla Jātaka);

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;robber (the scholiast, J.ii.389, explains that when a Bodhisatta is born as a wicked man it is due to a fault in his horoscope ) (Kanavera, Satapatta Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;smith (Sūnci Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;squire (e.g., Nanda Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stonecutter (Babbu Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teacher (numerous births, e.g.  Anabhirati, Durājāna, Losaka Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;treasurer (e.g.  as Cullaka, Visayha, Sankha and Suciparivāra); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tumbler (Ucchitthabhatta Jātaka); and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;valuer (Tandulanāli Jātaka).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;as a candāla in several births (e.g., as Citta and Mātanga); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in several instances as Sakka, (e.g.in the Kāmanīta, Kelisīla, Mahāpanāda and Vaka Jātakas;).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was born several times in the deva world (e.g.  as Dhamma and Bhaddasāla, also in the Kakkāru, Kāmavilāpa and Mittavinda Jātakas.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was a Brahmā of the Ābhassara world (Candābha and Janasodhana Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and a Mahābrahmā (Parosahassa and Mahānārada Kassapa), in the latter his name was Nārada.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was an air sprite (Puppharatta Jātaka) and a mountain sprite (e.g.  Kāka and Samudda Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a treesprite in numerous births (e.g.  Āyācitabhatta, Baka, Matakabhatta, Rukkhadhamma Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and a forest sprite (Kandina and Gūthapāna Jātakas).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Jātakas mention the birth of the Bodhisatta among animals - e.g., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;as buffalo (Mahisia Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bull (as Ayyakālaka, Nandivisāla, Mahālohita, Sārambha); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cock (in the two Kukkuta Jātakas, Nos.  383, 448); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;crow (as Vīraka and Supatta and in Kāka Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dog (Kukkura Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;elephant (e.g., Chaddanta and Sīlava Jātakas;); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fish (Mitacintī); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;frog (Haritamāta Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;garuda (e.g., Sussondi Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;goose (e.g.  Ulūka, Cakkavāka, Neru, Palāsa Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hare (Sasa Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;horse (Ājañña, Bhogājānīya Jātakas and as Vātaggasindhava); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;iguana (Godha Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;jackal (Sigāla Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;kinnara (as Canda); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;lion (e.g., Guna, Sigāla Jātaka (No.152), Sūkara Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mallard (Nacca Jātaka); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;monkey (Kapi, Nalapāna, Mahākapi, Sumsumāra Jātakas and as Nandyia); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;parrot (e.g.  as Jambuka, Pupphaka, Potthapāda, and Rādha); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;peacock (Nos.  42, 375, Mora, Bāveru, and Mahāmora Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pig (Mahātundila Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pigeon (Kapota, Kāka No.395, Romaka, Lola Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;quail (the three Vattaka, and Sammodamāna Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rat (Aggika and Bilāra Jātakas); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;snake - nāga (as Cāmpeyya, Bhuridatta, Mahādaddara, Sankhapāla); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vulture (as Aparanna and in the three Gijjha Jātakas, Nos.  164, 399, 427), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;woodpecker (as Khadiravaniya and in Javasakuna Jātaka).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born several times in the purgatories (Ap.i.299 ff).  The wishes of Bodhisattas are generally fulfilled (J.iii.283; v.282, 291; vi.  401, 405, etc.), chiefly because of their great wisdom (J.iii.282) and zeal (J.iii.425).  The wisdom of a Bodhistatta is greater than that of a Pacceka Buddha (J.iv.341).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The Buddha visited that city for her special benefit.  Seeing him as she was returning from her bath, she invited him to her house and gave him a meal.  She died soon after and was reborn in Tāvatimsa, where Moggallāna saw her and learnt her story.  Vv.ii.10; VvA.118f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhikkhādāyikā.  &lt;/b&gt; A similar story of a woman of Rājagaha who gave alms to an arahant monk and was reborn in Tāvatimsa.  Vv.ii.11; VvA.119f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;.  The true saint is he who does not hanker after the past and does not long for the future.  He is not swept away by present states of consciousness, but scanning his heart with insight, he struggles unceasingly to win eternal Changelessness (M.iii.187 ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta was learned by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; and used by him in an exposition to his colleagues.  This exposition was approved by the Buddha and came to be called the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda_bhaddekaratta_s,Ananda-Bhaddekaratta Sutta')"&gt;Ananda-Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.189 ff).  One day, as&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samiddhi,Samiddhi')"&gt;Samiddhi&lt;/a&gt; was drying himself after bathing at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tapodaa,Tapodā')"&gt;Tapodā&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, a deity questioned him on this sutta, and he had to confess his ignorance.  Samiddhi then went to the Buddha and asked him about the sutta, and the Buddha preached to him only the verses, with no explanation.  The monks, who were present, thereupon asked &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā Kaccāna')"&gt;Mahā Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed exposition.  He gave it, and the monks referred it to the Buddha who advised them to remember it.  This exposition came to be called the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccana_bhadd_s,Mahā Kaccāna Bhaddekaratta Sutta')"&gt;Mahā Kaccāna Bhaddekaratta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.192 ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/lomasakangiya_th,Lomasakangiya')"&gt;Lomasakangiya&lt;/a&gt; was asked about the sutta by the god &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/candana,Candana')"&gt;Candana&lt;/a&gt;, when he was staying in the Nigrodhārāma at Kapilavatthu.  He, in his turn, had to confess his ignorance, and Candana taught him the verses, which, he said, were uttered by the Buddha during his visit to Tāvatimsa.  When he went to preach the Abhidhamma.  The Commentary (MA.ii.962) explains that the Buddha preached this sutta for the benefit of devas who could not understand the Abhidhamma.  Lomasakangiya learnt the verses, and, going to the Buddha, questioned him concerning them.  The Buddha made them clear to him.  This account is called the Lomasakangiya-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.199ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracts from the Bhaddekaratta Sutta are uttered by speakers in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509,Hatthipāla Jātaka')"&gt;Hatthipāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.481) and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahakapi_jat_407_516,Mahākapi Jātaka')"&gt;Mahākapi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.v.66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Buddha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generic name, an appellative - but not a proper name - given to one who has attained Enlightenment (na mātarā katam, na pitarā katam - vimokkhantikam etam buddhānam bhagavantānam bodhiyā mūle ...  paññatti, MNid.458; Ps.i.174) a man superior to all other beings, human and divine, by his knowledge of the Truth (Dhamma).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The texts mention two kinds of Buddha: viz., &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacceka_buddha,Pacceka Buddhas')"&gt;Pacceka Buddhas&lt;/a&gt;- i.e., Buddhas who also attain to complete Enlightenment but do not preach the way of deliverance to the world; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sammāsambuddhas, who are omniscient and are teachers of Nibbāna (Satthāro).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries, however (e.g., SA.i.20; AA.i.65) make mention of four classes of Buddha: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sabaññu-Buddhā&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pacceka Buddhā&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catusacca Buddhā &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suta Buddhā&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All arahants (khīnāsavā) are called Catusacca Buddhā and all learned men Bahussuta Buddhā.  A Pacceka Buddha practises the ten perfections (pāramitā) for two asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, a Sabbañu Buddha practises it for one hundred thousand kappas and four or eight or sixteen asankheyyas, as the case may be (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven Sabbaññu Buddhas are mentioned in the earlier books; these are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vīpassī')"&gt;Vīpassī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii,Sikhī')"&gt;Sikhī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessabhuu,Vessabhū')"&gt;Vessabhū&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kakusandha,Kakusandha')"&gt;Kakusandha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana,Konāgamana')"&gt;Konāgamana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.g., D.ii.5f.; S.ii.5f.; cp.  Thag.491; J.ii.147; they are also mentioned at Vin.ii.110, in an old formula against snake bites.  Beal (Catena, p.  159) says these are given in the Chinese Pātimokkha.  They are also found in the Sayambhū Purāna (Mitra, Skt.  Buddhist Lit.  of Nepal, p.  249).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number is increased in the later books.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa,Buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; contains detailed particulars of twenty five Buddhas, including the last, Gotama, the first twenty four being those who prophesied Gotama's appearance in the world.  They are the predecessors of Vipassī, etc., and are the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dīpankara, Kondañña, Mangala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Nārada, Padumuttara, Sumedha, Sujāta, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī, Siddhattha, Tissa and Phussa.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same poem, in its twenty seventh chapter, mentions three other Buddhas - Tanhankara, Medhankara and Saranankara - who appeared in the world before Dīpankara.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lalitavistara has a list of fifty four Buddhas and the Mahāvastu of more than a hundred.  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavattisihanaada_s,Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta')"&gt;Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.75ff ) gives particulars of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/metteyya,Metteyya Buddha')"&gt;Metteyya Buddha&lt;/a&gt; who will be born in the world during the present kappa.  The&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anaagatavamsa,Anāgatavamsa')"&gt;Anāgatavamsa&lt;/a&gt; gives a detailed account of him.  Some MSS.  of that poem (J.P.T.S.  1886, p.  37) mention the names of ten future Buddhas, all of whom met Gotama who prophesied about them.  These are Metteyya, Uttama, Rāma, Pasenadi Kosala, Abhibhū, Dīghasonī, Sankacca, Subha, Todeyya, Nālāgiripalaleyya (sic).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s,Mahāpadāna Sutta')"&gt;Mahāpadāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.5f ) which mentions the seven Buddhas gives particulars of each under eleven heads (paricchedā) - the kappa in which he is born, his social rank (jāti), his family (gotta), length of life at that epoch (āyu), the tree under which he attains Enlightenment (bodhi), the names of his two chief disciples (sāvakayuga), the numbers present at the assemblies of arahants held by him (sāvakasannipāta), the name of his personal attendant (upatthākabhikkhu), the names of his father and mother and of his birthplace.  The Commentary (DA.ii.422ff) adds to these other particulars - the names of his son and his wife before his Renunciation, the conveyance (yāna) in which he leaves the world, the monastery in which his Gandhakuti was placed, the amount of money paid for its purchase, the site of the monastery, and the name of his chief lay patron.  In the case of Gotama, the further fact is stated that on the day of his birth there appeared also in the world Rāhulamātā, Ananda, Kanthaka, Nidhikumbhi (Treasure Trove), the Mahābodhi and Kāludāyī.  Gotama was conceived under the asterism (nakkhatta) of Uttarāsālha, under which asterism he also made his Renunciation (Da.ii425), preached his first sermon and performed the Twin Miracle.  Under the asterism of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakha,Visākha')"&gt;Visākha&lt;/a&gt; he was born, attained Enlightenment and died; under that of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maagha,Māgha')"&gt;Māgha&lt;/a&gt; he held his first assembly of arahants and decided to die; under Assayuja he descended from Tāvatimsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddhavamsa Commentary says (BuA.2f) that in the Buddhavamsa particulars of each Buddha are given under twenty two heads, the additional heads being the details of the first sermon, the numbers of those attaining realization of truth (abhisamaya) at each assembly, the names of the two chief women disciples, the aura of the Buddha's body (ramsi), the height of his body, the name of the Bodhisatta (who was to become Gotama Buddha), the prophecy concerning him, his exertions (padhāna) and the details of each Buddha's death.  The Commentary also says that mention must be made of the time each Buddha lived as a householder, the names of the palaces he occupied, the number of his dancing women, the names of his chief wife, and his son, his conveyance, his renunciation, his practice of austerities, his patrons and his monastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are eight particulars in which the Buddhas differ from each other (atthavemattāni).  These are length of life in the epoch in which each is born, the height of his body, his social rank (some are born as khattiyas, others as brahmins), the length of his austerities, the aura of his body (thus, in the case of Mangala, his aura spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of Gotama extended only one fathom; - but when he wishes, a Buddha can spread his aura at will, BuA.106); the conveyance in which he makes his renunciation, the tree under which he attains Enlightenment, and the size of the seat (pallanka) under the Bodhi tree.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the first five are mentioned in DA.ii.424; also at BuA.105; all eight are given at BuA.246f., which also gives details under each of the eight heads, regarding all the twenty five Buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of all Buddhas, there are four fixed spots (avijahitatthānāni).  These are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the site of the seat under the Bodhi tree (bodhipallanka), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Deer Park at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; where the first sermon is preached, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the spot where the Buddha first steps on the ground at Sankassa on his descent from Tusita (Tāvatimsa?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the spots marked by the four posts of the bed in the Buddha's &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; in Jetavana.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monastery may vary in size; the site of the city in which it stands may also vary, but not the site of the bed.  Sometimes it is to the east of the vihāra, sometimes to the north (DA.ii.424; BuA.247).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty facts are mentioned as being true of all Buddhas (samatimsavidhā dhammatā).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In his last life every Bodhisatta is conscious at the moment of his conception; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in his mother's womb he remains cross legged with his face turned outwards; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;his mother gives birth to him in a standing posture; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the birth takes place in a forest grove (araññe); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;immediately after birth he takes seven steps to the north and roars the "lion's roar"; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he makes his renunciation after seeing the four omens and after a son is born to him; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he has to practise austerities for at least seven days after donning the yellow robe; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he has a meal of milk rice on the day of his Enlightenment; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he attains to omniscience seated on a carpet of grass; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he practises concentration in breathing; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he defeats Māra's forces; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he attains to supreme perfection in all knowledge and virtue at the foot of the Bodhi tree; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mahā Brahmā requests him to preach the Dhamma; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he preaches his first sermon in the Deer Park at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he recites the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha,Pātimokkha')"&gt;Pātimokkha&lt;/a&gt; to the fourfold assembly on the full moon day of Māgha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he resides chiefly in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;, he performs the Twin Miracle in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he preaches the Abhidhamma in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he descends from there at the gate of Sankassa; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he constantly lives in the bliss of phalasamāpatti; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he investigates the possibility of converting others during two jhānas; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he lays down the precepts only when occasion arises for them; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he relates Jātakas when suitable occasions occur; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he recites the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa,Buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; in the assembly of his kinsmen; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he always greets courteously monks who visit him; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he never leaves the place where he has spent the rainy season without bidding farewell to his hosts; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;each day he has prescribed duties before and after his meal and during the three watches of the night; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;he eats a meal containing flesh (mamsarajabhojana) immediately before his death; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and just before his death he enters into the twenty four crores and one hundred thousand samāpattī.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also mentioned four dangers from which all Buddhas are immune: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;no misfortune can befall the four requisites intended for a Buddha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no one can encompass his death; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;no injury can befall any of his thirty two &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa,Mahāpurisalakkhanā')"&gt;Mahāpurisalakkhanā&lt;/a&gt; or eighty anubyañjanā; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nothing can obstruct his aura (BuA.248).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Buddha is born only in this Cakkavāla out of the ten thousand Cakkavālas which constitute the jātikkhetta (AA.i.251; DA.iii.897).  There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil.  236, and quoted in DA.iii.900f).  No Buddha can arise until the sāsana of the previous Buddha has completely disappeared from the world.  This happens only with the dhātuparinibbāna (see below).  When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother's womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp.  DA.iii.897).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s,Mahāpādāna Sutta')"&gt;Mahāpādāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.12-15) and the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/acchariyabbhuta_s,Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta')"&gt;Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha.  Later books (e.g., J.i.) have greatly enlarged these accounts.  They describe how the Bodhisatta, having practised the thirty Pāramī, and made the five great gifts (pañcamahāpariccāgā), and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariyā - ñātattha-cariyā, lokattha-cariyā and buddhi-cariyā - gives the seven mahādānā, as in the case of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara,Vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt;, making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after death in Tusita.  The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipassī Buddha, remained in Tusita during the whole permissible period - fifty seven crores and sixty seven thousand years.  But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing the full span of life there.  Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his end is near (see Deva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha.  The Bodhisatta thereupon makes the five investigations (pañcamahāvilokanāni).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kappa,kappa')"&gt;kappa&lt;/a&gt;, such a kappa being called Sārakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Varakappa; sometimes four, Sāramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f).  No Buddha is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching.  When the life of man is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/kilesa,kilesa')"&gt;kilesa&lt;/a&gt;.  The suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred years and not more than ten thousand.  The Bodhisatta must first consider the continent and the country of birth.  Buddhas are born only in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;, and there, too, only in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/majjhimadesa,Majjhimadesa')"&gt;Majjhimadesa&lt;/a&gt;.  He must then consider the family; Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more esteemed during that particular age.  Then he must think of the mother: she must be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the Buddha's birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandanavana,Nandanavana')"&gt;Nandanavana&lt;/a&gt; in Tusita, and while wandering about there "falls away" from Tusita and takes conception.  He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or dying thought.  The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is awareness of conception.  When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure.  For seven days previously she observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having bathed in scented water after the celebration of the Asālha festival, and having eaten choice food, takes upon herself the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt; vows and retires to the adorned state bedchamber.  As she sleeps, she dreams that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Four Regent Gods')"&gt;Four Regent Gods&lt;/a&gt; raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Himālaya, bathe her in Lake Anotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with heavenly flowers (according to the Nidānakathā, J.i.50, it is their queens who do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see Dial.ii.116n).  Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion.  There they lay her with her head to the east.  The Bodhisatta, assuming the form of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb.  She awakes and tells her husband of her dream.  Soothsayers are consulted, and they prophesy the birth of a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cakkavatti,Cakka-vatti')"&gt;Cakka-vatti&lt;/a&gt; or of a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother's womb.  It is said (DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of her middle age.  This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and child.  Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta.  The Commentaries expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the suttas.  Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion's roar: "Aggo 'ham asmi lokassa, jettho 'ham asmi lokassa, settho 'ham asmi lokassa, ayam antimā jāti, natthi dāni punabbhavo” (D.ii.15).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their symbolical meaning.  See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the attaining of the four iddhi-pādas; facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are the seven bojjhangas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain in this life, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven strides northwards.  Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka Culābhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohapāsāda, settled the question by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers felt he was traveling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone are open to him either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha.  They also discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapurisa,Mahāpurisa')"&gt;Mahāpurisa&lt;/a&gt;) (These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f).  The Bodhisatta has also the eighty secondary signs (asīti anubyañjana) such as copper coloured nails glossy and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc.  (The list is found in Lal.  121 [106]).  The Brahmāyu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all Buddhas.  Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on anything, he turns right round to do so (nāgavilokana).  When entering a house he never bends his body (Cp.  DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness.  When preaching, he neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139).  His voice possesses eight qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f).  A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies - of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājika')"&gt;Cātummahārājika&lt;/a&gt; world, and of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, of Māras and of Brahmās.  In these assemblies he becomes one of them and their language becomes his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;.  He renounces the world only after the birth of a son.  This, the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for other than a human being.  He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse.  Some Buddhas see all four on the same day, others, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"&gt;Vipassī&lt;/a&gt;, at long intervals (DA.ii.457).  On the night before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240).  After the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mahā &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"&gt;Brahmā&lt;/a&gt;.  This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his teaching (DA.ii.467).  A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because he wished to meet &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt; on the way (DA.ii.471).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha's day is divided into periods, each of which has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.).  He rises early, and having attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the alms round.  He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, sometimes with a large following of monks.  When he wishes to go alone he keeps the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271).  Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and then only khīnāsavā are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65).  Sometimes he goes in the ordinary way (pakatiyā), sometimes accompanied by many miracles.  After the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, talk to the monks and admonish them.  To those who ask for subjects of meditation, he would give them according to their temperament.  He would then retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while.  After that, he looks around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then preach to those who come to him for instruction.  In the evening he would bathe, and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice.  The middle watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him.  The last watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha's teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision.  Only beings that are veneyyā (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha's divine eye (DA.ii.470).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will.  This is called Sabbaññupavārana, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to answer any question (SNA.i.229).  Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead the good life.  This wandering is called cārikā and is of two kinds - turita and aturita.  The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person.  Thus Gotama travelled three gāvutas to meet &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;, thirty yojanas to see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalavaka,Alavaka')"&gt;Alavaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala,Angulimāla')"&gt;Angulimāla&lt;/a&gt;, forty five yojanas to see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukusāti')"&gt;Pukusāti&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  In the case of aturita cārikā progress is slow.  The range of a Buddha's cārikā varies from year to year.  Sometimes he would tour the Mahāmandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of six hundred yojanas.  A tour of the Mahāmandala occupies nine months, that of the Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months.  Details of the cārikā and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples (SNA.ii.474).  The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.).  His ñāña is one of the four illimitables (neither can the Buddha's body be measured for purposes of comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790).  He converts people in one of three ways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhipātihāriya), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;by reading their thoughts (ādesanāpātihāriya), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;or teaching them what is beneficial to them according to their character and temperament (anusāsanīpātihāriya).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha's rivals say that he possesses the power of fascination (āvattanīmāyā); but this is untrue, as sometimes (e.g., in the case of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambi')"&gt;Kosambi&lt;/a&gt; monks) he cannot make even his own disciples obey him.  Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha.  They are called buddha veneyyā (SNA.i.331).  Some are pleased by the Buddha's looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the Buddha's teaching is never really lost on the listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit (see, e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udumbarika_s,Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta')"&gt;Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, D.iii.57).  It is said that wherever a monk dwells during the Buddha's time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48).  Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of light from his &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him.  Stanzas so preached are called obhāsagāthā (SNA.i.16, 265).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Buddha founds an Order; the first pātimokkhuddesagāthā of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479).  The attainment of arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha's instruction (DA.iii.732).  Beings can obtain the four abhiññā only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204).  A Buddha has ten powers (balāni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of knowledge, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc.  At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers are given as consisting of his knowledge of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/n_r/paticca_samuppaada,Paticasamuppāda')"&gt;Paticasamuppāda&lt;/a&gt;.  The powers of a disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, e.g., D.iii.283) and physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants (BuA.37).  He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the ojā put into it by the devas.  No one else can eat with impunity the food which has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154).  Besides these excellences, a Buddha possesses the four assurances (vesārajjāni, given at M.i.71f)), the eighteen āvenikadhammā*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Described at Lal.  183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhammā, but they are all concerned with the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Given by Sāriputta in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sampasadaniya_s,Sampasādāniya Sutta')"&gt;Sampasādāniya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.iii.102ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree.  This faculty is possessed in ascending scale by titthiyā, pakatisāvakā, mahāsāvakā, aggasāvakā, pacceka buddhā and buddhā (E.g.,Vsm.411).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Buddha holds a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s,Mahāsamaya')"&gt;Mahāsamaya&lt;/a&gt;, and only a Buddha is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;).  Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa," but no Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the food he takes (DA.ii.413).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here means āyukappa, the full span of a man's life during that particular age.  Some, like Mahāsīva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of this Bhaddakappa.  But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Buddha, however, dies till the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/saasana,sāsana')"&gt;sāsana&lt;/a&gt; is firmly established (D.iii.122).  There are three parinibbānā in the case of a Buddha: kilesa parinibbāna, khandha parinibbāna and dhātu parinibbāna.  The first takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha's death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama's relics see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt;).  Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are dighāyuka have only sammukhasāvakā (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single thūpa being erected over them (SNA.  194, 195).  Short lived Buddhas hold the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/u_v/uposatha,uposatha')"&gt;uposatha&lt;/a&gt; once a fortnight; others (e.g.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet others (e.g.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī')"&gt;Vipassī&lt;/a&gt;) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten.  The first Pitaka to be lost is the Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patthāna and ending with the Dhammasangani.  Then, the Anguttara Nikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nipāta; next the Samyutta Nikāya from the Cakkapeyyāla to the Oghatarana; then the Majjhima, from the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and then the Dīgha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmajāla.  Scattered gāthā like the Sabhiyapucchā, and the Ālavakapucchā, last much longer, but they cannot maintain the sāsana.  The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being the mātikā of the Ubhatovibhanga (VibhA.432).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f).  It is said that on the night on which a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134).  Here we have the beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual "transfiguration" of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light can shine (SNA.ii.525).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Buddha is born during the samvattamānakappa, but only during the vivattamānakappa (SNA.i.51).  A Bodhisatta who excels in paññā can attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddhā, in eight, and one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f).  When once a being has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune (SNA.i.50).  The Buddha is referred to under various epithets.  The Anguttara Nikāya gives one such list.  There he is called Samana, Brāhmana, Vedagū, Bhisaka, Nimmala, Vimala, Ñānī and Vimutta (C.iv.  340).  Buddhaghosa gives seven others: Cakkkumā, Sabbabhūtanukampī, Vihātaka, Mārasenappamaddī, Vusitavā, Vimutto and Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tathāgata.  This term is explained at great length in the Commentaries - e.g., DA.i.59f.  His followers usually address him as Bhagavā, while others call him by his name (Gotama).  In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as Sakka (SN.  vs.  345; perhaps the equivalent of Sākya), Brahma (SN.  p.91; SNA.ii.418), Mahāmuni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262).  Countless other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones.  One very famous formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula being: Bhagavā araham sammāsambuddho, vijjācaranasampanno, sugato, lokavidū, anuttaro, purisadammasārathi, satthā devamanussānam, Buddho Bhagavā (these words are analysed and discussed in Vsm.  198 ff).  It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) that the Buddha's praises are limitless (aparimāna).  One of his most striking characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissallāna), (D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.).  When he is in retirement it is usually akāla for visiting him (D.ii.270).  There are also certain accusations, which are brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude.  "It is said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion.  By intercourse with whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of things.  He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle" (D.iii.38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37).  The dwelling place of a Buddha is called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt;.  His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it.  When once he wishes it to be visible, no one can erase it.  He can also so will that only one particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194).  It is also said that his power of love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence (SNA.ii.475).  A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42).  When the Buddha is seated in some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222).  He prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bherivāda Jātaka (No.59)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a drummer, and having gone one day, with his son, to a great festival where he had earned much money, was returning through a forest infested by robbers.  The boy kept on beating the drum, though his father tried to stop him, saying, "Beat it only now and again, as if some great lord were passing by." At first the robbers were seared away, but they soon discovered that the two were alone and robbed them of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to a self willed monk who is identified with the youth of the story.  J.i.283-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaggā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a tribe and a country, the capital of which was Sumsumāragiri (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha went there several times in the course of his wanderings (e.g., A.ii.61, A.iv.85, etc.; Vin.ii.127; iv.  115, 198) and three rules for the monks were laid down there (Vin.v.145).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhirājakumāra (q.v.  1), son of Udena of Kosambi, lived there, apparently as his father's viceroy, in which case the Bhaggā were subject to Kosambī.  The C.H.I.  (i.175) says that the Bhaggā were members of the Vajjian confederacy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bhagga country lay between Vesāli and Sāvatthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while sojourning in the Bhagga country that Moggallāna was attacked by Māra entering into his stomach (M.i.332), and it was there that he preached the Anumāna Sutta (M.i.95).  Sirimanda and the parents of Nakula were inhabitants of the Bhagga country, and Sigālapitā (ThagA.i.70) went there in order to meditate; there he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apadāna (Ap.ii.359) the Bhaggā are mentioned with the Kārusā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahmanimantanika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana.  The Buddha tells the monks of his visit to Baka Brahmā, who holds the view that this world is eternal.  The Buddha tells Baka that his view is false, whereupon Māra, having taken possession of one of the Brahmās, protests and urges the Buddha not to be recalcitrant.  Baka himself agrees with the Buddha, who tells him of planes of existence of which Baka knows nothing.  Baka then says that he will vanish from the Buddha's presence, but finds himself unable to do so.  The Buddha then vanishes and repeats a stanza for the Brahmās to hear.  Baka admits defeat, but Māra again enters into a Brahmā and asks the Buddha not to communicate his doctrine to others.  The Buddha refuses to agree to this.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is so called because it was preached on account of Baka Brahmā's challenge (M.i.326ff).  Cp.  Bakabrahma Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhañña&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word occurs in the compound &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkalaa,Ukkalā')"&gt;Ukkalā&lt;/a&gt; (Okkalā) Vassa-Bhaññā (S.iii.73; M.iii.78; A.ii.31), a group described as ahetuvādā, akiriyavādā, natthikavāda, but who, nevertheless, agreed that the khandhas might be divided into past, present and future and who accepted the teaching of the Great Forty (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahacattaariisaka_s,Mahācattārīsaka Sutta')"&gt;Mahācattārīsaka Sutta&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also accepted non covetousness, non malice, right mindfulness and right concentration as worthy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries (AA.ii.497; MA.ii.894; SA.ii.201 says, dve pi te mūladitthigatikā ) explain that Vassa and Bhañña were two people (dvejanā) (? tribes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buddharakkhita &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Buddharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; A monk of Ceylon, an eminent teacher of the Vinaya.  Vin.v.3; Sp.i.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Buddharakkhita.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk of Ceylon.  He was once, with thirty thousand others, ministering to the Elder Mahārohanagutta of Therambatthala, when he saw the king of the Supannas dashing across the sky to seize the Nāga king who was offering rice gruel to the Elder.  Buddharakkhita immediately created a mountain into which he made the Elder enter, thus saving the Nāga king.  Vsm.154 f., 376.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  Buddharakkhita.&lt;/b&gt; A monk of Ceylon to whom is sometimes ascribed the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jinaalankaara,Jinālankāra')"&gt;Jinālankāra&lt;/a&gt;.  He is supposed to have lived about 426 B.C.  on the west coast of Ceylon, at the head of a congregation of monks (P.L.C.18).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to others, he is said to have written both the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jinaalankaara,Jinālankāra')"&gt;Jinālankāra&lt;/a&gt; and its Tīkā.  E.g., Gv.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Buddharakkhita.  &lt;/b&gt; See Mahā Buddharakkhita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bakkula, Bākula, Vakkula Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was; born in the family of a councillor of Kosambī, and, while being bathed by his nurse in the waters of the Yamunā, he slipped into the river and was swallowed by a fish.  The fish was caught by an angler and sold to the wife of a Benares councillor.* When the fish was split open the child was discovered unhurt, and cherished by the councillor's wife as her own son.  On discovering his story, she asked permission of his parents to keep him.  The king decided that the two families should have him in common, hence his name Bākula (two families - bi kin).** &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This preservation of Bakkula was due to the power of the sanctity of his last life; it was a case of psychic power diffused by knowledge (ñānavipphārā iddhi), PS.ii.211; Vsm.379.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** Cp.  the explanation of bakkula in J.P.T.S.  1886, pp.  95ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a prosperous life, at the age of eighty, Bakkula heard the Buddha preach and left the world.  For seven days he remained unenlightened, but on the dawn of the eighth day he became an arahant.  Later, the Buddha declared him to be foremost in good health (A.i.25; for a problem connected with this, see Mil.215ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Anomadassī Buddha, he was a learned Brahmin who became a holy hermit.  He heard the Buddha preach and became his follower, and when the Buddha suffered from stomach trouble, he cured him and was reborn later in the Brahma world.  In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a householder of Hamsavatī, and, hearing a monk acclaimed as most healthy, he wished for a similar honour in a future life.  Before the appearance of Vipassī Buddha, he was born in Bandhumatī, where he became a hermit.  Later, he saw the Buddha, acknowledged him as teacher, and cured a monk of tinapupphakaroga (? hay fever).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he renovated an old vihāra and provided the monks with medicaments (AA.i.168 ff.; MA.ii.928 ff.; ThagA.i.434 ff.; Ap.i.328 ff.; PSA.491).  Bakkula lived to a very old age* (AA.ii.596), and shortly before his death ordained Acela Kassapa, who had been his friend in his lay days.** Bakkula was one of the four who had great abhiññā (mahābhiññappattā) in the time of Gotama Buddha, the others being the two chief disciples and Bhaddā Kaccānā (AA.i.204).  He is often mentioned (E.g., MA.i.348) as an example of a monk who practised asceticism without preaching it to others.  Fifty five kappas ago he was a king named Anoma (v.l.  Aranemī) (Ap.i.329).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* according to the Bakkula Sutta (M.iii.125), he was eighty years a monk.  This is confirmed by DA.ii.413, where his age is given as 160.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** See Bakkula Sutta below.  The Thag.  contains three verses (225 7) which he spoke when about to pass away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bandhanāgāra Jātaka (No.201) &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born in a poor family and supported his mother.  Having provided him with a wife, much against his will, she died soon after.  When his wife was with child, he wished to go away and became an ascetic, but his wife persuaded him to stay.  On her second conception he ran away and, becoming an ascetic, rejoiced in his freedom from the bonds of wife and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related when some monks reported to the Buddha that a gang of thieves had been taken captive by &lt;b&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/b&gt; and put in chains.  No chains were stronger than those of passion, said the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.i.139ff.; cp.  &lt;b&gt;Bandhana Sutta&lt;/b&gt; (2); the verses given in the Jātaka are also found there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bāveru Jātaka (No.339)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once some merchants sailed from Bārānasī to Bāveru (Babylon) with a crow on board to help them in finding land.  There were then no birds in Bāveru, and the people, marvelling at the sight, bought the bird, after much bargaining, for one hundred pieces and paid it great honour.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another voyage, the same merchants brought with them a peacock (the Bodhisatta), and this bird, after much show of reluctance on the part of the merchants, was sold to the people of Bāveru for one thousand pieces.  From the time of the arrival of the more beautiful peacock, the crow was entirely neglected and flew away on to a refuse heap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the fact that from the time the Buddha appeared in the world, the heretics lost all their glory.

Bhūta Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; The son of a very wealthy councillor of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saketa,Sāketa')"&gt;Sāketa&lt;/a&gt;, his last and only child, the others having been devoured by a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yakkha,Yakkha')"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt;.  The child was, therefore, well guarded at his birth, but the Yakkha had meanwhile gone to wait on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessavana,Vessavana')"&gt;Vessavana&lt;/a&gt; and had not returned.  The boy was called Bhūta so that non humans might protect him.  He grew up in great luxury, but, like &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt;, having heard the Buddha preach at Sāketa, he entered the Order and dwelt on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajakaranii,Ajakaranī')"&gt;Ajakaranī&lt;/a&gt;, where he attained arahantship.  Later, when visiting his relations, he stayed in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anjana_vana,Añjanavana')"&gt;Añjanavana&lt;/a&gt;.  They besought him to remain there, but this he refused to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a brahmin and, seeing the Buddha, he sang his praises in four verses.  Fourteen kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Uggata.  Thag.vs.518 26; ThagA.i.493ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Parappasādaka Thera of the Apadāna.

It first explains the sīlā, or moral precepts, in three successive sections cūla (concise), majjhima (medium), and mahā (elaborate) and then proceeds to set out in sixty two divisions various speculations and theories regarding the "soul" (D.i.46).  Other names for it are Atthajāla, Dhammajāla, Ditthijāla, and Sangāmavijaya.  At the end of the discourse the ten world systems trembled (D.i.46).  It is said that once when Pinndapātiya Thera recited this sutta at the Kalyāniya vihāra, his mind concentrated on the Buddha, the earth trembled; the same phenomenon occurred when the Dīghabhānaka Theras recited it at the Ambahtthikā, to the east of the Lohapāsāda (DA.i.131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmaj'āla was the first sutta preached in Suvannabhūmi, when Sona and Uttara visited it as missionaries (Mhv.xii.51).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta is often quoted, sometimes even in the Canon.  E.g., S.iv.  286, 287.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhadra, or ? Bhagandha Hatthaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headman Bhadragaka visits the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and asks for a teaching about dukkha.  The Buddha says he will talk neither of the future nor of the past, but only of the present.  By means of questioning Bhadragaka, the Buddha makes him realize that sorrow and suffering come only through desire.  For example, he would grieve if anything happened to his friends in Uruvelakappa, or to his son Ciravāsi, or to his wife; but he would not worry about those who were unknown to him and therefore unloved by him (S.iv.327f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says (SA.iii.103) that in this sutta vattadukkha (? the sorrow of transmigration) is described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhayabherava Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jānussoni visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him how it is that young men who have left the world under him should be able to live in solitude, in the depths of the forest, a joyless life.  The Buddha answers that while yet a Bodhisatta he was assailed by the same doubts.  Fear comes only to him whose heart is filled with desire and longing, and who is restless, witless, and drivelling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the man, who is pure, resolute, and free from corruptions of the heart, lives in confidence in the forest and develops the jhānas.  The Buddha then describes how he passed through these stages of development before becoming the Enlightened One (M.i.16ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta contains an account of the "threefold lore"(tisso vijjā) of the Buddha (see Sp.i.116) and praises of the Saranā (Refuges) (Sp.i.172).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhojana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhojana Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; He who gives food gives four things to the receiver thereof: life, beauty, comfort, and strength.  A.ii.64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhojana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; In giving a meal, the giver gives five things: life, beauty, comfort, strength, and ready understanding (patibhāna), and he himself also becomes a partaker of these things.  A.iii.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddā Kapilānī Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a Kosiyagotta Brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sagala,Sāgala')"&gt;Sāgala&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/madda,Madda')"&gt;Madda&lt;/a&gt; country.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ap.ii.583 (vs.  57) says that her mother was Sucīmatī and her father &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila,Kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt;, whence, probably, her title of Kāpilānī.  When the messengers sent by the parents of Pipphali-mānava (&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;) were wandering about seeking for a wife for him to resemble the image they carried with them, they discovered Bhaddā and informed Pipphali's parents.  The parents arranged the marriage without the knowledge of the young people and Bhaddā went to Pipphali's house.  There they lived together, but, by mutual consent, the marriage was never consummated.  It was said that, she brought with her, on the day of her marriage, fifty thousand cartloads of wealth.  When Pipphali desired to leave the world, making over to her his wealth, she wished to renounce it likewise, and together they left the house in the guise of recluses, their hair shorn, unobserved by any.  In the village, however, they were recognized by their gait, and the people fell down at their feet.  They granted freedom to all their slaves, and set forth, Pipphali leading and Bhaddā following close behind.  On coming to a fork in the road, they agreed that he should take the right and she the left.  In due course she came to the Titthiyārāma (near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt;), where she dwelt for five years, women not having yet been admitted to the Buddha's Order.  Later, when&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapajapati_gotami,Pajāpatī Gotamī')"&gt;Pajāpatī Gotamī&lt;/a&gt; had obtained the necessary leave, Bhaddā joined her and received ordination, attaining arahantship not long after.  Later in the assembly, the Buddha declared her foremost of nuns who could recall former lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara Buddha')"&gt;Padumuttara Buddha&lt;/a&gt; she was the wife of Videha, a setthi of Hamsavatī, and having heard a nun proclaimed in the first rank of those who could recall former lives, she resolved to acquire a similar rank, while her husband (Mahā Kassapa in this life) resolved to be chief among those who practise austere vows (dhutavādinam).  Together they did many good deeds and were reborn in heaven.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vipassii,Vipassī Buddha')"&gt;Vipassī Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the husband was the brahmin Ekasātaka and she was his wife.  In his next birth he was king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and she his chief queen.  Together they entertained eight Pacceka Buddhas on a very lavish scale.  In the interval between the appearance in the world of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/konaagamana,Konāgamana')"&gt;Konāgamana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa Buddha')"&gt;Kassapa Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, the husband was a clansman and she his wife.  One day a quarrel arose between her and her sister-in law.  The latter gave alms to a Pacceka Buddha and Bhaddā, thinking "She will win glory for this," took the bowl from her hand and filled it with mud.  But later she was filled with remorse, took back the bowl, emptied it, scrubbed it with scented powder and, having filled it with the four sweet foods, sprinkled over the top ghee of the colour of a lotus calyx.  Handing it back to the Pacceka Buddha, she prayed to herself "May I have a shining body like this offering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a later birth, Bhaddā was born as the daughter of a wealthy treasurer of Benares; she was given in marriage, but her body was of such evil odour that she was repulsive to all and was abandoned by several husbands.  Much troubled, she had her ornaments made into an ingot of gold and placed it on the shrine of Kassapa Buddha, which was in process of being built, and did reverence to it with her hands full of lotuses.  Her body immediately became fragrant and sweet, and she was married again to her first husband.  The Apadāna account mentions two other lives: one when she was the wife of Sumitta and gave a blanket to a Pacceka Buddha, and again when she was born among the Koliyans and attended on one hundred Pacceka Buddhas of Koliya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, she was the queen of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, king of Benares (Brahmadatta, according to the Apadāna, which gives King Nanda as the name of her husband in another life), with whom she ministered to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati,Padumavatī')"&gt;Padumavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  When they passed away she was greatly troubled and left the world to give herself up to ascetic practices.  She dwelt in a grove, developed &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/g_m/jhaana,jhāna')"&gt;jhāna&lt;/a&gt;, and was reborn in the Brahma world.  (ThigA.67ff.; Ap.ii.578ff.; AA.ii.93ff., 203f.; A.i.25; Thig.vs.63-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddā Kāpilānī's name is mentioned several times (e.g., Vin.iv.227, 268, 269, etc.) in the Vinaya rules in connection with her pupils who were found guilty of transgressing them.  She and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/thulla_nandaa,Thullanandā')"&gt;Thullanandā&lt;/a&gt; were both famous as preachers, and the latter, being jealous of Bhaddā, went out of her way to insult her (Vin.iv.290).  Once Bhaddā sent word to Sāketa asking Thullanandā if she could find her a lodging in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;.  Nandā agreed to do this, but made things very unpleasant for Bhaddā when she arrived.  (Vin.iv.292)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddā Kāpilānī is identified with the brahmin woman in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hatthipala_jat_509,Hatthipāla Jātaka')"&gt;Hatthipāla Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.491) and with Sāma's mother in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sama_jat_540,Sāma Jātaka')"&gt;Sāma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.95).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bilārikosiya Jātaka (No.450)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a rich merchant of Benares who built an almonry and distributed much alms.  On his deathbed, he asked his son to continue with the alms, and, after death, he was reborn as Sakka.  His son followed him and became the god Canda.  His son Suriya, Suriya's son Mātalī, and Mātalī's son Pañcasikha, all followed in the same path.  But the sixth of the line, Bilārikosiya, became a miser and burnt the almonry.  Sakka and the others then came separately, in the guise of brahmins, to visit him and to ask for alms.  Kosiya refused their request until each one uttered a little verse, when he was asked to enter and receive a small gift.  Kosiya asked the servant to give each a little unhusked rice.  This was refused, and in the end he was obliged to give the brahmins cooked rice, meant for cows.  Each swallowed a mouthful, but then let it stick in his throat and lay down as if dead.  Kosiya, very frightened, had a meal prepared, which he put into their bowls, and then, calling in the passers by, asked them to note how the brahmins, in their greed, had eaten too much and died.  But the brahmins arose, spat out the rice, and publicly shamed Kosiya by showing up his miserliness and the manner in which he had disgraced his ancestors.  Then each revealed his identity and departed.  Bilārikosiya mended his ways and became most generous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a monk reputed for his great generosity; he would not even drink a cup of water without sharing it.  The monk is identified with Bilārikosiya, and the Buddha related the story in order to show how he had changed his ways.  Sāriputta was Canda, Moggallāna Suriya, Kassapa Mātalī and Ananda Pañcasikha.  J.iv.62 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bandhujīvaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bandhujīvaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;.  An arahant.  Thirty one kappas ago he strung bandhujīvaka flowers together and offered them to Sikhī Buddha.  Seven kappas ago he was a king named Samantacakkhu (Ap.i.175f).  He is probably identical with Devasabha.  ThagA.i.203f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bandhujīvaka Thera&lt;/b&gt;.  An arahant.  He met Siddhattha Buddha in the forest ninety four kappas ago and offered him lotuses and bandhujīvaka flowers.  Fourteen kappas ago he was a king named Samuddakappa.  Ap.i.192.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahudhīti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of the Bhāradvājagotta who had seven widowed daughters and was much in debt.  One day he lost fourteen oxen, and, after searching for them for six days, he came across the Buddha in a forest tract.  He spoke the praises of the Buddha's freedom, unperturbed by the anxieties to which he himself was a prey for the Buddha had no nagging wife, no creditors, no vermin disturbing his sleep.  The Buddha agreed with him, and he was so pleased with the Buddha's words that he asked to be ordained.  The Buddha ordained him (S.i.170f ); the Commentary adds (SA.i.187ff), that he took the newly ordained to Pasenadi to whom he related what had happened.  The king summoned the man's creditors; and paid them off, and having sent for his wife and daughters he took them under his protection.  The man soon after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhandukanna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A juggler, who tried to make &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapanaada,Mahāpanāda')"&gt;Mahāpanāda&lt;/a&gt; laugh.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made a mango tree, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/a5_az,Atulamba')"&gt;Atulamba&lt;/a&gt;, grow before the palace door and climbed it with the help of a string.  Vessavana's slaves chopped him up and threw the pieces down, and the other jugglers joined the pieces together and poured water over them.  Bhandukanna then donned upper and under garments of flowers and started dancing again.  But he could not make Mahāpanāda laugh.  J.iv.324.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bakkula Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakkula's friend, Acela Kassapa, visits him at Veluvana in Rājagaha.  Bakkula tells him of his life during the eighty years of monkshood, and Kassapa wishes to be ordained under him.  Soon after, Kassapa becomes an arahant, and Bakkula passes away as he sat on his pyre.  M.iii.124ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bilālapādaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rich man of Sāvatthi.  Once a resident of Sāvatthi invited the Buddha and all his monks to a meal and went from house to house asking the householders to share in the almsgiving.  Bilālapādaka, annoyed at the request, gave only as much as could be grasped by three fingers - hence his name - ("cat foot").  The man took the gifts and added them to the others, but Bilālapādaka, suspecting that he might be disgraced in public, went to the almsgiving with a knife concealed on his person, ready to kill the man if he should mention his gift in ridicule.  But he heard the man offer the alms to the Buddha, expressing the wish that all who had joined in the almsgiving should receive a rich reward.  Moved by the man's largeness of heart, Bilālapāda fell at his feet, confessing his guilty intentions and begging for pardon.  The Buddha thereupon preached to Bilālapāda, who, at the conclusion of the sermon, became a sotāpanna.  DhA.iii.17ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bumū&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a gotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The village of Uttarakā belonged to them, and when the Buddha was staying there with Sunakkhatta, the latter was greatly taken up with the practices of Korakkhattiya (D.ii.6).  v.l.  Thulū and Khulū.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editors of the Sumangala Vilāsinī have adopted the reading Khuhū.  DA.iii.819.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bodhimanda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the spot under the Bodhi tree where the Buddha attained Enlightenment and where he sat for one week after the Enlightenment (Vin.i.1; but according to DhA.i.71 he spent seven weeks there).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery was later erected there called the &lt;b&gt;Bodhimanda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;b&gt;-vihāra&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;Thirty thousand monks, under Cittagutta, came from there to the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.41).  It was near here that Buddhaghosa was born (Cv.xxxvii.215), and here Silākāla entered the Order (Cv.xxxix.47).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirukka,Bodhirukkha')"&gt;Bodhirukkha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin ascetic who went from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaapatha,Dakkhināpatha')"&gt;Dakkhināpatha&lt;/a&gt; and lived on the banks of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/godhaavarii,Godhāvarī')"&gt;Godhāvarī&lt;/a&gt; in a hermitage which lay half in the territory of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/assaka,Assaka')"&gt;Assaka&lt;/a&gt; and half in that of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/alaka,Alaka')"&gt;Alaka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received the revenue of a village near by and held a great sacrifice, spending all he possessed.  Then to him came a brahmin of terrible mien, demanding five hundred pieces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(He was a brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dunnivittha,Dunnivittha')"&gt;Dunnivittha&lt;/a&gt;.  His wife was a descendant of the family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/juujaka,Jūjaka')"&gt;Jūjaka&lt;/a&gt; and was constantly nagging at him.  It was she who sent him to Bāvarī, AA.i.183).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bāvari told him of his poverty, the brahmin cursed him saying that his head would split in seven pieces.  Bāvarī was greatly distressed, but a devatā (his mother in a previous birth, AA.i.183), seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of "head" nor of "the splitting of it." "Who then knows it?" asked Bāvarī, and the devatā told him of the appearance in the world of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  Forthwith he sent his sixteen pupils - &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajita,Ajita')"&gt;Ajita&lt;/a&gt;, Tissametteyya, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/punnaka,Punnaka')"&gt;Punnaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mettagu_th,Mettagū')"&gt;Mettagū&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhotaka,Dhotaka')"&gt;Dhotaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upasiiva,Upasīva')"&gt;Upasīva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanda,Nanda')"&gt;Nanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemaka,Hemaka')"&gt;Hemaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/todeyya,Todeyya')"&gt;Todeyya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappa,Kappa')"&gt;Kappa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jatukannii,Jatukannī')"&gt;Jatukannī&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhadravudha,Bhadrāvudha')"&gt;Bhadrāvudha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udaya,Udaya')"&gt;Udaya&lt;/a&gt;, Posāla, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mogharaja_th,Mogharāja')"&gt;Mogharāja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pingiya,Pingiya')"&gt;Pingiya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha and to find out if his claims to Buddha-hood were justified.  The pupils went northward, through &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/alaka,Alaka')"&gt;Alaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patitthaana,Patitthāna')"&gt;Patitthāna&lt;/a&gt;, Māhissati, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;, Gonaddha, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vedisa,Vedisā')"&gt;Vedisā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vanasavhya (or Tumbava, v.l.  Vanasāvatthi), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kosambī, Sāketa and Sāvatthi; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;then, finding that the Buddha had gone to Rājagaha, they followed him there to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasanaka_cetiya,Pāsānaka cetiya')"&gt;Pāsānaka cetiya&lt;/a&gt;, passing through &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kusinārā, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhogagamanagara,Bhoganagara')"&gt;Bhoganagara&lt;/a&gt; and Vesāli.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they arrived before the Buddha, they greeted him in the name of Bāvarī, and being satisfied that he bore the characteristic signs of a Great Being, Ajita asked Bāvarī's question of the Buddha, and when that had been answered, each of the pupils asked him a question in turn, to which the Buddha replied.  For a problem arising out of the manner in which some of the marks were seen, see Mil.168f.; DA.i.275f.  This account is given in SN.vs.976 1148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Commentary (SNA.603f), all Bāvarī's disciples and their sixteen thousand followers whom they had gathered on their way, became arahants at the conclusion of the Buddha's sermon, save only Pingiya, Bāvarī's nephew, who became an anāgāmī, because he had been thinking of Bāvarī when the Buddha preached.  Pingiya took leave of the Buddha and returned to Bāvarī, to whom he recounted all these events.  At the end of his recital, the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of glory and preached to them.  Pingiya thereupon became an arahant and Bāvarī an anāgāmī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Bāvarī was King Katthavāhana (q.v.).  Hearing of the Buddha from his friend, the king of Benares, he sent messengers, including his nephew, to find out about the Buddha and to report to him.  But the nephew returned with the news of the Buddha's death, which had taken place before their arrival at Benares.  Thereupon, Katthavāhana, having accepted the Buddha's teaching, engaged in various good deeds and was reborn after death in the Kāmāvacara deva-world.  From there he was born in the family of Pasenadi's chaplain and was the teacher of Pasenadi's boyhood.  Unwilling to remain longer in the court, he took leave of the king and lived in the royal park as an ascetic.  Then, wishing for greater peace, he retired to an island (antaradīpa) in the Godhāvarī where the two kings Assaka and Alaka gave him a tract of land, five leagues in extent, the residence of the sages of old.  It was from there that he sent his disciples to the Buddha (SNA.575ff.; AA.i.182ff).  At that time he was one hundred and twenty years old.  Bāvarī was the name of his gotta.  He bore on his body three of the marks of a Great Being.  SN.vs.1019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhīmatittha-vihāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in the Pañcayojana district of Ceylon (the modern Bentota).  In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/parakkamabahu,Parakkamabāhu II')"&gt;Parakkamabāhu II.&lt;/a&gt; a tooth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; was enshrined in the vihāra, and the king visited the vihāra and held a three days' festival in honour of the relic (Cv.lxxxv.81).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittinissanka laid out a garden of fruit trees in the vihāra precincts, and later Devappatirāja, minister of Parakkamabāhu II., laid out, on the king's orders, a great grove of coco palm, a yojana broad, from the vihāra up to Kālanadītittha.

A monk may wish to be free from the āsavas and from attachment, but his wish will be fruitless unless he develops the four satipatthānas, the four sammappadhānas, the four iddhi-pādas, the five indriyas, the five powers, the seven bojjhangas, and the Eightfold Noble Path.  Without these he resembles one who waits for eggs to hatch out when there is no hen.  But if the monk develops these qualities he will wear away the āsavas, etc., and be aware that they are worn away, like a carpenter who knows when the handle of his adze is worn away; all these things will weaken and rot away like a ship out of the water all the winter, exposed to wind and rain.  A.iv.125f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhāvanā Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The four satipatthānas, if cultivated, conduce to the state in which no further and no hither shore exist.  S.v.180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhāvanā Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The cultivation of the four satipatthānas consists in contemplation of body, feelings, mind, and mind states.  S.v.182.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhāvanā Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  On psychic (iddhi ) power, its basis, its cultivation, amid the practice which leads to its cultivation.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddayānikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An offshoot of the Vajjiputtaka heretics (Mhv.v.7; Dpv.v.46).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their doctrines resembled those of the Dhammuttariyas; in birth is ignorance and in the arresting of birth is the arresting of ignorance (Rockhill, op.  cit., 194).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also held the view that the corruptions were put away by slices.

Bhāgineyya Sangharakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was the nephew of the Elder Sangharakkhita, hence his name.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, at a certain monastery he was given two sets of robes, and immediately put away the better set to be given as a present to his uncle and teacher.  At the end of the rains, he went to the monastery of his uncle, and, having waited upon him, offered his gift.  But his uncle refused it in spite of the youth's repeated request.  Thereupon the nephew became sulky, and while fanning the Elder, started to think what he could do if he became a layman.  He would sell his robe, buy a she goat, get rich thereby, marry, and have a son.  While taking the child out for a walk, he would ask to be allowed to carry him, his wife would refuse and carry him herself.  Then she would drop the child and her husband would hit her.  So thinking, in his absent-mindedness, the youth hit the Elder with the fan.  The Elder read his thoughts and rebuked him.  The youth then started to run away, but the monks caught him and brought him before the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to him on the difficulty of keeping the mind in check.  At the end of the sermon the youth became a sotāpanna.  DhA.i.300ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhāgineyya Sangharakkhita&lt;/b&gt;.  A novice who ate hot food and burnt his tongue.  His teacher warned him against such lack of restraint, and the novice, developing insight on that topic, became an arahant.  Vsm., p.  45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhāgineyya Sangharakkhita&lt;/b&gt;.  A monk who lived in the Kotagerukapāsada during his illness.  His cell could accommodate just one bed, yet the devas of two deva worlds, led by Sakka, were present there to wait upon him.  MT.  552.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

A discussion between Sāriputta and Jambukhādaka on "becoming." S.iv.258.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhava Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  On the three kinds of bhava in the kāma world, the rūpa world, and the arūpa world.  S.v.56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; There are three kinds of bhava: kāma, rūpa, and arūpa; these can be given up by training in further virtue, further thought, and further insight.  A.iii.444.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhava Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Ananda asks the Buddha to what extent there is "becoming." There will be "becoming" as long as there are worlds of sense, of form, and of formlessness; action is the field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture which bring about rebirth in these worlds.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhisapuppha Jātaka (No.392)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was born once as an ascetic, and one day a goddess, having seen him smell a lotus in bloom, upbraided him, telling him he was a thief to smell a lotus which did not belong to him.  Near by was a man digging up lotus plants for their fibres, but to him the goddess said nothing.  When questioned, her answer was that in a man like the Bodhisatta, seeking for purity, a sin even as large as a hair tip showed like a dark, cloud in the sky.  The Bodhisatta, greatly impressed, thanked her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goddess is identified with Uppalavannā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk who was upbraided by a deity in a forest tract in Kosala for smelling a lotus.  In great agitation, he went and consulted the Buddha, who told him the above story.  J.iv.307ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahāchatta Jātaka (No.336)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Brahmadatta, king of Benares, captured Kosala with its king, and brought all its treasures to Benares, where he buried them in iron pots in the royal park.  Chatta, the Kosala king's son, escaped, and became an ascetic near Takkasilā with a following of five hundred.  Later he came with his followers to Benares, won the heart of the king by his demeanour, and lived in the royal park.  There, by means of a spell, he discovered the buried treasure, and taking his followers into his confidence, took the treasure to Sāvatthi and made the city impregnable.  When Brahmadatta discovered his loss and its results, he was disconsolate, but was comforted by his minister, who was the Bodhisatta, and who pointed out to him that Chatta had but taken what belonged to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a knavish monk, identified with Chatta.  J.iii.115ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bilāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat once stood on the refuse heap of a house drain, and when the mouse who lived there came out, pounced on her and ate her.  But the mouse gnawed the guts of the cat so that she died.  Such will be the fate of monks who go among the dwellings of householders with unrestrained senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta was preached to a recalcitrant monk.  S.ii.270.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhadraghata Jātaka (No.291)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Bodhisatta was a rich merchant with an only son.  He did great good and was born as Sakka.  The son squandered all his wealth in drinking and amusements and fell into poverty.  Sakka took pity on him and gave him the Bhadraghata (Wishing Cup), asking him to take care of it.  But one day, when the son was drunk, he threw the cup into the air and smashed it, thus reducing himself once again to misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a ne'er-do-well nephew of Anāthapindika.  His uncle helped him again and again, but he squandered everything, and one day Anāthapindika had him turned out of his house.  The two squanderers were the same.

(D.iii.1ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was evidently so called because he belonged to the gotta named Bhaggava (? potters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahuputta , Bahuputtaka cetiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrine in the neighbourhood of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;, to the north of that city (D.iii.9).  The Buddha is said to have stayed there (D.ii.118;, Ud.vi.1; S.v.259).  It was a pre Buddhist shrine and, according to the Commentaries (E.g., UdA.323; SA.ii.128, etc.), was a many branched nigrodha tree where persons prayed for sons to the deva of the tree.  Hence its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; says that while yet a "learner" he paid homage to the Buddha at a Bahuputtaka-nigrodha where the Buddha had gone to meet him.  The Buddha taught him of the training to be followed and, profiting by the lesson, eight days later Mahā Kassapa became an arahant.  This nigrodha, however, was on the road from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"&gt;Nālandā&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and was three leagues from Rājagaha*.  It cannot, therefore, have been identical with the tree, which gave its name to the Bahuputta cetiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* S.ii.220; see &lt;b&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/b&gt;.  It was here that the Buddha exchanged his robe for that of Kassapa, SA.ii.128; ThagA.ii.145; AA.i.102; Mtu.iii.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhalluka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nephew of Dīghajantu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He received a message from Elāra, in consequence of which he landed at Mahātittha in Ceylon with sixty thousand men, only to find that Elāra was dead and had been cremated seven days earlier.  Bhalluka thereupon marched on Anurādhapura and pitched his camp at Kolambahālaka.  Dutthagāmani marched against him, and a battle took place in the precincts of the Mahāvihāra.  Bhalluka shot an arrow at the king, and, believing that it had pierced his mouth, set up a great shout, but Phussadeva, who was seated on Kandula immediately behind the king, shot at Bhalluka, who thereupon fell dead prostrate at the feet of the king.  Mhv.xxv.77ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Bhallika, Bhalliya, Bhalluka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger brother of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tapassu,Tapassu')"&gt;Tapassu&lt;/a&gt;, their father being a caravan leader of Pokkharavatī in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkalaa,Ukkalā')"&gt;Ukkalā&lt;/a&gt; (AA.i.207 calls their birthplace Asitañjana).  While they were going along with five hundred trading carts, these stopped near the Rājāyatana tree where the Buddha was sitting, eight weeks after his Enlightenment.  When they investigated the cause for their carts thus stopping, a deity, their kinsman in a former life (their mother according to AA.i.207), pointed out to them the Buddha and asked them to give him a meal as he had eaten nothing for seven weeks.  Not waiting to cook, the merchants gave the Buddha some butter and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods.  At the end of the meal the Buddha talked to them.  They accepted the Buddha and the Dhamma as their Refuge (the Dvevācikasarana, they thus became the Buddha's first lay disciples; A.i.26), and obtained from the Buddha a few hairs as an object of worship.  Later, when the Buddha was in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; after the preaching of his First Sermon, the merchants visited him and listened to his preaching.  Tapassu became a sotāpanna, and Bhallika entered the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Bhallika had given fruit to a Pacceka Buddha, named Sumana.  During this life of Sikhī Buddha, he was a brahmin of Arunavatī, and hearing that Ujita and Ojita had given the Buddha his first meal, he and his friend invited the Buddha to eat at their house, and resolved to win a similar distinction for themselves in the future.  They were herdsmen in the life of Kassapa Buddha, and for many years supplied milk rice to the Buddha and the monks (ThagA.i.48f.; AA.i.207f.; Vin.i.3f.; J.i.80. Mhv.iii.303f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā (vs.7), contains a verse spoken by Bhallika when Māra tried to frighten him by assuming a hideous form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the hair (eight handfuls) given by the Buddha was deposited in a cetiya in Asitañjana and that on fast days blue rays shone from the cetiya.  AA.i.208. There is a tradition in Ceylon (recorded in the Pūjāvaliya) that Tapassu and Bhalluka visited the east coast of Ceylon and built a cetiya, there.  An inscription makes a similar record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhallika, Bhalluka&lt;/b&gt;.  One of the of the chief lay patrons of Dīpankara Buddha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bārānasī (Benares)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi,Kāsi-janapada')"&gt;Kāsi-janapada&lt;/a&gt;.  It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists -the others being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapilavatthu,Kapilavatthu')"&gt;Kapilavatthu&lt;/a&gt;, Buddhagayā and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kusinaaraa,Kusināra')"&gt;Kusināra&lt;/a&gt;- because it was at, the Migadāya in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/isipatana,Isipatana')"&gt;Isipatana&lt;/a&gt; near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya,Pañcavaggiyā')"&gt;Pañcavaggiyā&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.141).  This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka).  It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues (MA.i.388; Bu.A.242, etc.), but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/upaka,Upaka')"&gt;Upaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benares was an important centre of trade and industry.  There was direct trade between there and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddiya,Bhaddiya')"&gt;Bhaddiya&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.i.189), and between there and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt; (DhA.i.123).  It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā (E.g., J.ii.4; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/susiima,Susīma')"&gt;Susīma&lt;/a&gt;, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha.  From Benares the road continued to Vesāli (Sp.i.201).  On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda (Vin.i.220).  There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares (Vin.i.275).  The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (E.g., J.iv.377; vi.160; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues.  The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama.  (The SNA.  on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings.  In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (D.ii.235).  The Ceylon Chronicles (MT.  127,129,130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares- e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka.  The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (J.iv.119f); and in that of the Sankha, Molinī (J.iv.15).  It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura (E.g., J.v.54; vi.165; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kāsi.  The Bhojājāniya Jātaka (J.i.178) says that "all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares." In the Brahāchatta Jātaka (J.iii.116), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala.  At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance.  Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to.  The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (J.ii.403).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Licchavis, Kāsī, too, was included in his kingdom.  Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ananda as suitable places for the Parinibbāna of the Buddha (D.ii.146).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is also made of a Bānārasīsetthi (E.g., DhA.i.412; iii.  87, 365) and a Santhāgārasālā (Mote Hall), which was then, however, no longer being used so much for the transaction of public business as for public discussions on religious and philosophical questions.  E.g., J.iv.74; ascetics who came to the city found lodging for the night in the Potters' Hall (e.g., DhA.i.39).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near Benares was a grove of seven sirīsaka trees where the Buddha preached to the Nāga king Erakapatta (DhA.iii.230), and also the Kemiyambavana where Udena met Ghotamukha (M.ii.158); on the other side of the river was Vāsabhagāma, and beyond that another village called Cundatthila (PvA.168).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in Benares, where he preached several sermons (E.g., A.i.110f., 279f.; iii.392ff., 399ff.; S.i.105; v.406; Vin.i.189, 216f., 289) and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares (Vin.i.15), and his friends Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families (Vin.i.19).  Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so for long after.  From there came twelve thousand monks under the leadership of Dhammasena to be present at the ceremony of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Bārānasī was the birthplace of Kassapa Buddha (Bu.xxv.33).  In the time of Metteyya Buddha, Bārānasī will be known as Ketumatī at the head of eighty four thousand towns.  Sankha will be Cakkavatti there, but he will renounce the world and will become an arahant under Metteyya (D.iii.75f).  Bārānasī evidently derives its name from the fact that it lies between the two rivers Barnā and Asi (CAGI.499f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhagu Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in a Sākiyan family, and having left the world with his clansmen &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kimbila,Kimbila')"&gt;Kimbila&lt;/a&gt;, he dwelt in the village of Bākalona.  One day, having left his cell in order to drive away his drowsiness, he fell as he was stepping on to the terrace, and, urged thereby to further effort, he accomplished self mastery and won arahantship.  Later, when he was living in the bliss of fruition, the Buddha came to congratulate him on his solitude.  Thag.vss.271-4; ThagA.i.380f.; cf.  M.iii.155; Vin.i.350, ii.182; DhA.i.56, 133; J.i.140, iii.489; Mil.107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (SA.ii.222; this sermon is referred to as the Kilesya Sutta) that, on this occasion, the Buddha, after his meal, preached to Bhagu for a whole day and a whole night.  The next day Bhagu accompanied the Buddha on his alms round, and turned back when the Buddha proceeded to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya,Pācīnavamsa-migadāya')"&gt;Pācīnavamsa-migadāya&lt;/a&gt; to see Anuruddha and the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Bhagu, was a householder, and, after the Buddha's death, offered flowers to his relics.  As a result he was born among the Nimmānaratī gods (ThagA.i.380).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Jātipupphiya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.405f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk named Bhagu is mentioned (Vin.i.300) as staying with Jātipupphiya at the Kukkutārāma in Pātaliputta, but he is probably a different person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bālanakkhatta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A festival lasting for seven days, during which people smeared their bodies with ashes and cow dung and went about talking coarsely.  They respected no one, and when they visited at a house where their conversation was not appreciated, they received one penny to go away.  Once when the festival was being held in Sāvatthi, the Buddha's followers requested him not to leave the monastery, and provided him and the monks with all requisites so that they did not have to go out.  DhA.i.256 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaggava&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhaggava.  &lt;/b&gt; A teacher to whom the Buddha went after leaving &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, and before seeking&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aalara_kaalaama,Alāra')"&gt;Alāra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uddaka_raamaputta,Uddaka')"&gt;Uddaka&lt;/a&gt;.  ThigA., p.  2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhaggava.&lt;/b&gt; Father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angulimaala,Angulimāla')"&gt;Angulimāla&lt;/a&gt; and chaplain of the king of Kosala.  Bhaggava was a brahmin.  Thag.A.ii.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhaggava.  &lt;/b&gt; A potter in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; in whose dwelling the Buddha met and conversed with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukkusāti')"&gt;Pukkusāti&lt;/a&gt; (M.iii.237).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaggava seems to have been a generic name for all potters, perhaps a special form of address used towards members of the kumbhakāra "caste." Thus we find in the books several instances of potters being addressed as "Bhaggava".  E.g., DhA.i.33; J.ii.80, iii.382. At J.111.382 the potter's wife is addressed as "Bhaggavī."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.36, 60) the Buddha addresses Ghatīkāra Brahmā as "Bhaggava"; he had been a potter of Vehalinga in his previous birth and the name "Ghatīkāra" itself means "jar maker." The Commentaries give no explanation of the word; perhaps the potters claimed their descent from Bhrgu.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaggava is sometimes given as an example of a gotta.  E.g., Sp.i.160 (with Gotama).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaggavagotta,Bhaggavagotta')"&gt;Bhaggavagotta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bandhanamokkha Jātaka (No.120)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once chaplain to King &lt;b&gt;Brahmadatta&lt;/b&gt;.  While the king was absent, quelling a frontier rebellion, his queen sinned with all the messengers sent by the king to inquire after her welfare.  On the day of the king's return, the chaplain, while decorating the palace, entered the queen's apartments, and she asked him to satisfy her lust.  When he refused the queen (feigning illness) charged him with having ill treated her.  Thereupon the king ordered that the chaplain be beheaded, but the latter begged to be brought before the king, where he protested his innocence and proved, by the testimony of the king's messengers, the queen's wickedness.  The king wished to put to death the queen and all the messengers, but the chaplain interceded on their behalf and they were pardoned.  He himself retired to the Himāya, where he became an ascetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to the attempt of &lt;b&gt;Ciñcā&lt;/b&gt; to bring calumny upon the Buddha.  The queen is identified with Ciññcā and the king with &lt;b&gt;Ananda&lt;/b&gt;.  J.i.437ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Baka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Brahmā.  When the Buddha was once staying at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ukkatthaa,Ukkatthā')"&gt;Ukkatthā&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhagavana,Subhagavana')"&gt;Subhagavana&lt;/a&gt;, he read the thoughts of Baka, who had conceived the idea that this world was permanent and free from decay and death; and the Buddha visited him in order to point out his error.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka welcomed the Buddha but, owing to the influence of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt;, refused to acknowledge his error, until the Buddha, by the exercise of his magical power, prevented Baka from disappearing from sight, while he himself dissolved into complete darkness.  The Buddha then proceeded to tell him of four incidents connected with his previous birth as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava,Kesava')"&gt;Kesava&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.326ff.; S.i.142ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka was once born in a noble family, but he renounced the world and became an ascetic named Kesava.  One day, seeing a caravan in distress in the desert, by his supernatural power he turned a river into the desert, thereby rescuing the members of the caravan.  On another occasion, while staying on the banks of the river &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/e/enii,Enī')"&gt;Enī&lt;/a&gt;, near a frontier village, he found the village being attacked by dacoits, whom he drove away by causing them to see a vision of the royal police approaching, with himself at their head.  On another day he saw people floating down the river in boats, making merry, singing and drinking.  The Nāga of the river, incensed at their behaviour, appeared before them, threatening destruction.  Kesava, assuming the form of a Garuda, frightened the Nāga away.  The fourth incident is related in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kesava_jat_346,Kesava Jātaka')"&gt;Kesava Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  The Bodhisatta, known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappa,Kappa')"&gt;Kappa&lt;/a&gt;, was the pupil of Kesava.  Kesava, practising meditation, developed the fourth jhāna and was born in the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vehapphala,Vehapphala')"&gt;Vehapphala&lt;/a&gt; world.  While there he developed the third jhāna and was born in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/subhakinna,Subhakinha')"&gt;Subhakinha&lt;/a&gt; world.  Thence he descended to the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aabhassara,Abhassara')"&gt;Abhassara&lt;/a&gt; world, and, later, by practising the first jhāna, he was reborn in the same world, but with a span of life of only a single kappa (J.iii.358 ff.; SA.i.164 f.; MA.i.553 ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakabrahma_sutta,Bakabrahma Sutta')"&gt;Bakabrahma Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baka 2.&lt;/b&gt; The Bodhisatta, born as the king of Benares.  For his story see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancapapa,Pañcapāpā')"&gt;Pañcapāpā&lt;/a&gt;.  J.v.440ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>

Bhoja.  &lt;/b&gt; A brahmin, one of the eight who read the auspicious marks on the Buddha's body on the fifth day after his birth.  J.i.56; in the Milinda (p.236) he is called Subhoja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhoja.&lt;/b&gt; A physician of old.  J.iv.  496, 498.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

Bīja Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The five sorts of seed, if unspoilt and planted in good soil, and nourished by wind and water, will sprout and grow.  Like to the five kinds of seed are the five kinds of consciousness; like to the earth the four satipatthānas, like to water the lure of lust.  S.iii.54f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bīja Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Just as earth is essential to all seed and vegetation, so is virtue essential to the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path.  S.v.54f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bīja Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Perverted view is the most fertile soil for the development of evil states.  A.i.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

He was the child of a poor man of Rājagaha, and went one day with his father in a cart to the forest to collect firewood.  By the time they returned to the town gate, evening had fallen.  The cart was halted awhile, and the oxen, having got free from the yoke, entered the town.  Telling the child to sit near the cart, the father set off after the oxen.  Before he could return, the gate was shut, and the child owed his escape during the night from wild beasts and demons to his ñānavipphāra-iddhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the place where he slept was near to a cemetery, no evil spirit could harm the boy as that birth was destined to be his last.  He later joined the Order and became an arahant, being famed as Bhūtapāla Thera.  PSA.  493f.; Vsm.379f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhūtapāla.  &lt;/b&gt; The Vibhanga Commentary in explaining the term kāsāvapajjota says that it means "resplendent with the colour of orange, completely (ekobhāsinī) like the family of Bhūtapālasetthi" (Bhūtapālasetthikulasadisānī).

Bhikkhū Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A monk who knows decay and death, birth, becoming, grasping, craving, etc., their arising, their cessation and the way thereto such a monk stands knocking at the door of Deathlessness.  S.ii.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhikkhū Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Whatever monks have destroyed the āsavas by personal knowledge and insight, have done so by cultivating and developing the four iddhipādas.  It is the same for the past, present and future.  S.v.257.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhikkhū Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha explains to a group of monks psychic power and its cultivation.  S.v.287.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhikkhū Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; The Buddha tells a group of monks about the seven bojjhangas and their cultivation.  S.v.334f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bhikkhū or Suddhika Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Four conditions, the possession of which makes of a disciple a sotāpanna.  S.v.403.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bālapandita Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 129th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, preached at Jetavana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It deals with the disabilities of folly and the pain and anguish resulting there from, also with the advantages of wisdom and the bliss to which it leads.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains, besides, descriptions of the horrors of the hells, expressed by means of various similes (M.iii.163ff.; cp.  S.ii.23f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta forms a kind of prose background to the Bāla Vagga and the Pandita Vagga of the Dhammapada.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahinda preached this Sutta at the Nandapavana in Anurādhapura, and one thousand women, who listened to him, became sotāpannas.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Baka Jātaka (No.38)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crane, living near a pond, where the water dried up in summer, offered to carry the fish to a distant pond where water was plentiful.  The fish, very suspicious, sent one of their numbers with the crane to verify his words, and when he returned with a favourable report, they accepted the crane's offer.  One by one the fish were carried off and eaten by the crane, till only a crab was left.  The wily crab agreed to go too, but he clung round the crane's neck while being carried along and cut off his head with his pincers when he discovered the crane's intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a monk of Jetavana who was a clever robe maker.  He could make robes of rags, which he dyed so skilfully that they looked new and costly.  Visiting monks, on seeing them, would exchange their new robes for his old ones and not discover their folly till later.  A similar robe maker lived in a hamlet at some distance from Jetavana, who, hearing of the Jetavana monk succeeded in cheating him.  The monk was the crane and the hamlet dweller the crab of the story.  J.i.220 ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Baka Jātaka (No.236)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a large shoal of fish.  A crane, who wished to eat them, stood on the bank of the pond with outstretched wings, gazing vacantly into space.  The fish were impressed by his pious demeanour, but were warned against him by the Bodhisatta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a hypocrite who is identified with the crane.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahumangala cetiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrine in Anurādhapura in the image house of which Dhātusena erected Bodhisatta figures.  He also provided a diadem of rays for the Buddha images in the cetiya.  These images were known as Kāselasatthā and Upasumbha (Cv.xxxviii.65).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cetiya is probably identical with the Mangala cetiya (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

One day, in a frontier village, a very rich landowner saw him, and, pleased with his appearance, brought him a very luxurious meal.  The king took the food and passed it to his chaplain; the latter gave it to an ascetic who happened to be by.  The ascetic placed it in the bowl of a Pacceka Buddha sitting near them.  The Pacceka Buddha proceeded, without a word, to eat the meal.  The landowner was astonished and asked them the reason for their action, and, on learning that each one was progressively greater in virtue than the king, he rejoiced greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a landowner of Sāvatthi, a devout follower of the Buddha.  Being anxious to honour the Dhamma also, he consulted the Buddha, and, acting on his advice, invited Ananda to his house and gave him choice food and three costly robes.  Ananda took them and offered them to Sāriputta, who, in his turn, made a gift of them to the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the king of the story, Sāriputta the chaplain, while the ascetic was the Bodhisatta.

An anāgāmī, one of seven persons who became arahants as soon as they were born in Avihā.  S.i.35, 60; ThigA.  222, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhaddiya Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; Called Kāligodhāputta, chief among monks of aristocratic birth (uccakulikānam) (A.i.23).  He belonged to a family of the Sākyan rājas of Kapilavatthu and entered the Order in the Anupiya Mango grove with Anuruddha and the others, soon afterwards attaining to arahantship.  Dwelling in the bliss of Nibbāna, under a tree in a lonely spot, Bhaddiya used to exclaim "Aho sukham, aho sukham." When this was reported to the Buddha, he questioned Bhaddiya, who answered that when he was ruling his principality he was well protected, yet was ever fearful and nervous, whereas now, having renounced all, he was free from all fear (Thag.vss.842-65; UdA.ii.10; Vin.i.183f.; J.i.140).  This incident was the occasion for the preaching of the Sukhavihārī Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddiya was the son of Kāligodhā, the senior Sākyan lady of her time.  For five hundred births Bhaddiya had been king, hence his eminence in this life, though there were others more aristocratic (AA.i.109).  His resolve to gain this distinction was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when he was born in a very rich family and did various good deeds towards that end.  In the interval between Kassapa Buddha and Gotama Buddha, he was a householder of Benares and, discovering that Pacceka Buddhas took their meals on the banks of the Ganges, placed seven stone planks for them to sit on (ThagA.ii.55f.; Ap.i.95f).  When Bhaddiya was ruling his Sākyan principality he had as general Sona Potiriyaputta, who later joined the Order (ThagA.i.316).  Anuruddha was Bhaddiya's great friend, and when Anuruddha wished to renounce the world, his mother agreed only on condition that Bhaddiya should accompany him, hoping, in this way, to hold him back.  But Anuruddha overcame all Bhaddiya's objections and persuaded him to renounce the household life within a week.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Vin.ii.182f) that Bhaddiya attained arahantship in the first rainy season after his ordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  Bhaddiya.  &lt;/b&gt; A city in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anga,Anga')"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; kingdom (DhA.i.384; also iii.363).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha visited there several times and stayed sometimes at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatiyaavana,Jātiyāvana')"&gt;Jātiyāvana&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mendaka,Mendaka')"&gt;Mendaka&lt;/a&gt;, who lived there, came to see him (Vin.ii.242; DhA.iii.363; also A.iii.36).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there that the precept was laid down forbidding monks to wear sandals.  Vin.i.190; DhA.iii.451f.; also another ruling re the Pārājikā (Vin.iii.37f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhaddiya was also the residence of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddaji_th,Bhaddaji Thera')"&gt;Bhaddaji Thera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visaakhaa,Visākhā')"&gt;Visākhā&lt;/a&gt;.  v.l.

Bhaddiya.  &lt;/b&gt; A Licchavi who visited the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and asked if it were true that the Buddha was a magician who, by a glamorous trick, enticed away the followers of others.  The Buddha advised Bhaddiya not to be led away by hearsay but to judge for himself; and he then proceeded, by means of question and answer, to convince Bhaddiya that his teachings were truly founded on fact and, if accepted and practised, would benefit not only human beings but the very trees of the forest (A.ii.190ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (AA.ii.558) that, at the conclusion of the discourse, Bhaddiya became a sotāpanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bodhigutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brother of Vedisadevī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to the Sākyan clan, and with Sumitta was leader of the retinue sent by Asoka to escort the branch of the Bodhi tree to Anurādhapura.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the planting of the tree, Bodhigutta was taken by the king to Morapāsāda and there invested with the rank of Lankājayamahālekhaka (q.v.) amid great pomp and ceremony.  He was given a house near the Bodhi tree.  Later he married Sunandā, sister of Bodhiguttā, and had two children - Mahinda and Vidhurinda.  Mbv.154 f., 163 f., 169.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Once, when Sakka went to see the Buddha at the Salalāgāra, he found the Buddha engaged in meditation, Bhuñjatī waiting on him and worshipping him with clasped hands.  Sakka asked her to salute the Buddha in his name when he should awake from his meditation (D.ii.270f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa adds (DA.iii.705) that Bhuñjatī had reached the second Fruit of the Path and found no pleasure in the luxuries of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Bhuvanekabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; A Singhalese ruler (Ādipāda) who founded a town at Govindamala in Rohana and dwelt there after Māgha's forces had devastated Ceylon.  Cv.lxxxi.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhuvanekabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; The younger son of Vijayabāhu III.  When Parakkamabāhu II.  came to the throne, Bhuvanekabāhu was made Yuvarāja.  By the king's orders he learnt the Tipitaka, in which he became well versed, and later instructed the Theras therein.  Cv.lxxxi.68; lxxxii.4; lxxxiv.29. See also Bhuvanekabāhu-parivena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhuvanekabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; The second of the five sons of Parakkamabāhu II.  He was entrusted (by Vijayabāhu IV.) with the defence of the north of Ceylon with his headquarters at Sundarapabbata.  He later built a town there where he settled.  When Vijayabāhu died and Mitta usurped the throne, Bhuvanekabāhu fled from the capital (Jambuddoni) and narrowly escaped death on the way.  But soon after, the Ariya soldiers revolted against Mitta and restored Bhuvanekabāhu to the throne, where he ruled for eleven years (1237-84 A.C.) as Bhuvanekabāhu I.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other acts of piety, he appointed scribes to copy the whole of the Tipitaka, and gave copies to the chief vihāras of Ceylon.  Cv.lxxxvii.16; lxxxviii.24, 79; xc.4, 28ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bhuvanekabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Bhuvanekabāhu I.  He succeeded Parakkamabāhu III.  and had his capital at Hatthiselapura.  Every year, in the month of Jetthamūla, he held a great festival to celebrate his coronation and to admit new members into the Order.  He ruled for eleven years (1291 1302 A.C.).

Buddhadatta Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uragapura,Uragapura')"&gt;Uragapura&lt;/a&gt; in South India and wrote his works in the monastery of Bhūtamangalagāma in the Cola country, his patron being Accutavikkama.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He studied, however, at the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavihara,Mahāvihāra')"&gt;Mahāvihāra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"&gt;Anurādhapura&lt;/a&gt;.  Tradition says (e.g., SadS., p.55) that he met &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhadatta's works include the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vinaya_vinicchaya,Vinaya-Vinicchaya')"&gt;Vinaya-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttaravinicchaya,Uttara-Vinicchaya')"&gt;Uttara-Vinicchaya&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhidhammaavataara,Abhidhammāvatāra')"&gt;Abhidhammāvatāra&lt;/a&gt; and the Rūpārūpa-Vibhāga.

Buddhadatta.&lt;/b&gt; Head of a dynasty of twenty five kings who reigned in Rājagaha.  His ancestors reigned in Mithilā.  Dpv.iii.30; the MT.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Belattha Kaccāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sugar dealer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his way from Andhakkavinda to Rājagaha he met the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree, and, with his permission, presented a pot of sugar (gulakumbha) to the monks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the monks had shared as much of the sugar as they wished, much was left over, and the Buddha asked Kaccāna to throw it into the water.  This he did, and the water crackled.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha preached to Kaccāna who accepted his teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vin.i.224ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhīma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sage of old who possessed the five abhiññā and great iddhi-powers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, at that time, was a learned brahmin, and, having met Bhīma, said that he was a sensualist (kāma-bhogī), and his disciples agreed with him.  It was for this reason the Buddha and five hundred monks suffered calumny at the hands of Sundarikā.  Ap.i.299; UdA.264.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhārata&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A title by which &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pañcāla, king of Uttarapañcāla, is addressed in the Sattigumba Jātaka (J.iv.435); &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;also the king of Benares, in the Sankhapāla Jātaka (J.v.170) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and Manoja, king of Benares, in the Sona Nanda Jātaka (J.v.317, 326).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast explains (J.v.317) the word by ratthabhāradhāritāya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahudhātuka Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavan')"&gt;Jetavan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,a')"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains a series of questions asked by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; answers.  The Buddha describes various ways in which the monk can achieve mastery of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the elements (dhātu), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the senses, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the chain of causation,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the rationally possible and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the rationally impossible.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other names for the sutta are Catuparivatta, Dhammādāsa, Amatadundubhi and Anuttara Sangāmavijaya.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bahuvedanīya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcakanga asks Udāyi (Pandita Udāyī, says MA.ii.629) how many kinds of feelings the Buddha mentions.  Udāyi answers that there are three:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;pleasant, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unpleasant and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;indifferent.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pañcakanga, however, insists that there are but two: pleasant and unpleasant.  Ananda, overhearing the conversation, reports it to the Buddha, who says that both Pañcakanga and Udāyi are correct because he himself classified feelings in various ways; sensual pleasures might be pleasant, but are not the highest pleasures; far better and more excellent are the pleasures enjoyed by a monk who develops the four jhānas, the plane of infinity of consciousness and the plane of nought.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.i.396ff.; the Sutta is repeated at S.iv.223ff., under the name of Pañcakanga Sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Bhaddiya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Records the visit of the Licchavi Bhaddiya to the Buddha and also their conversation.  A.ii.190ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bhaddiya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  Preached in reference to Lakuntaka Bhaddiya (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though hunchbacked and unsightly, yet, says the Buddha, he was highly gifted, of a lofty nature, having achieved his goal.  Even a puny boy, if wise, is truly great, feared by men as the lion is by animals.  S.ii.279.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bhaddiya Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha tells Bhaddiya Thera (2) that the Noble disciple who is a sotāpanna is pleased with four things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the Dhamma, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to the Sangha, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and virtues; that are dear to the Noble Ones.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;S.v.403.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brāhmana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Brāhmana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Ananda sees, on his begging round, Jānussoni's white chariot, drawn by four white mares, the people crowding round it and declaring it the best and most beautiful of chariots.  He goes to the Buddha and asks him if such a description could be used of the Buddha.  The Buddha says that the Noble Eightfold Way can be so described.  S.v.4f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Brāhmana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A brahmin visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks why it is that the Buddha's Doctrine will disappear soon after his death.  The Buddha says it is because of the failure of men to realize the four satipatthānas.  S.v.174.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Brāhmana Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The brahmin Unnābha visits Ananda at the Ghositārāma and questions him.  Ananda tells him that the life of a recluse has for its object the abandonment of desire and that this is brought about by the cultivation of the four iddhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-pādas.  That would be a task without end, says Unnābha; but Ananda proves to him that once the purpose is accomplished, there remains nothing more to do.  Unnābha accepts Amanda as his teacher.  S.v.271f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Brāhmana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The Buddha explains to the monks how the teachings of the brahmins differ from his on the practice leading to prosperity.  S.v.361.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Brāhmana Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.  The Buddha explains, in answer to the question of a brahmin, how the Dhamma can be described as sanditthika.  A.i.156.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Brāhmana Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Two brahmins, skilled in lokāyata, visit the Buddha and say that, according to Pūrana Kassapa, the world is finite, while, according to Nigantha Nātaputta, it is infinite, and that both teachers claim omniscience.  How can one know which teaching is true? The Buddha dismisses their question and teaches them that it is not by trying to walk to the end of the world that the end of the world can be reached, but by understanding the five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguna).  This can be accomplished by the cultivation of the jhānas.  A.iv.428f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddāli Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha, at Jetavana, laid down the rule that monks should eat one meal a day and that in the morning, Bhaddāli protested and refused to keep this rule because he said that, in so eating, he would be a prey to scruples and misgivings.  For three months he avoided the Buddha, until, just before the Buddha was starting on a journey, Bhaddāli, acting on the advice of his fellow monks, confessed his fault to the Buddha and begged for forgiveness (M.i.437ff).  The Buddha praised this action and preached to him the Bhaddāli Sutta (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (MA.ii.648) that, in a previous birth, Bhaddāli had been a crow, therefore in this life he was always hungry and was known among his fellows as the Great Eater (Mahāchātaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty kappas ago he met Sumedha Buddha in the forest, wrapt in meditation, and, having tidied the place where the Buddha was sitting, he erected over him a pavilion.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Buddhasīha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk of Ceylon, pupil of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhadatta,Buddhadatta')"&gt;Buddhadatta&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at his request that Buddhadatta (1) wrote the Rūpārūpavibhāga (an Abhidhamma treatise).  (P.L.C.108).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one tradition (SadS.30) Buddhasīha himself was the author of the work, but the colophon to the book states otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhallātiya Jātaka (No.504)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Bhallātiya, king of Benares.  Desirous of eating venison cooked on charcoal, he gave the kingdom in charge of his courtiers and went to the Himālaya on a hunting expedition.  While wandering about near Gandhamādana, among pleasant streams and groves, he came across two kinnaras fondly embracing each other and then weeping and wailing most pitifully.  The king quieted his hounds, laid down his weapons, and approached the kinnaras.  In answer to his questions, the female told him that one day, while she was picking flowers on the opposite bank for a garland for her lover, it grew late and a storm arose.  The stream which separated the two lovers swelled in flood and they had to spend the night apart from each other.  The memory of one night, thus passed in separation, had filled them with sorrow for six hundred and ninety seven years, and they still wept whenever they thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a quarrel between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallikaa,Mallikā')"&gt;Mallikā&lt;/a&gt; about conjugal rights.  They were sulky and refused to look at each other.  The Buddha visited the palace and reconciled them.  The two kinnaras were identified with the king and the queen.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brahmāyu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin foremost in Mithilā in his knowledge of the Vedas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On hearing of the Buddha at the age of one hundred and twenty, he sent his pupil Uttara to discover if the Buddha had on his body the marks of a Mahāpurisa.  Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to this end, followed him about for seven months.  He then returned to Brahmāyu and told him of the result of his investigations.  Brahmāyu folded his palms reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha.  Soon after, the Buddha came to Mithilā and took up his residence in the Makhādeva ambavana.  Brahmāyu, having sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that all those present rose to greet him, but Brahmāyu signed to them to be seated.  He satisfied any remaining doubts he had as to the marks on the Buddha's body and then proceeded to ask him questions on various topics.  At the end of the discussion he fell at the Buddha's feet, stroking them and proclaiming his name.  The Buddha asked him to compose himself, and preached to him on "progressive" discourse.  Brahmāyu invited the Buddha and his monks to his house, where he entertained them for a week.  His death occurred not long after, and the Buddha, when told of it, said that Brahmāyu had become an Anāgāmī (M.ii.133ff).  Brahmāyu's salutation of the Buddha is described as panipāta.

Near by was the house in which lived &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nakulapita,Nakulapitā')"&gt;Nakulapitā&lt;/a&gt; and Nakhulamātā (A.ii.61; iii.295; S.iii.1; iv.116).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, when the Buddha was at Bhesakalāvana, he saw, with his divine eye, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; dwelling in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pacinavamsamigadaya,Pācīnavamsadāya')"&gt;Pācīnavamsadāya&lt;/a&gt; in the Ceti country, and appeared before him to encourage him in his meditations (A.iv.228ff.; J.iii.157).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The palace &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada,Kokanada')"&gt;Kokanada&lt;/a&gt;, built for Prince &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhi,Bodhi')"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, was in the neighbourhood of the grove (Vin.ii.127; DhA.iii.134, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while staying in this grove that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Mahā Moggallāna')"&gt;Mahā Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; was molested by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt; and he preached the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maaratajjaniiya_s,Māratajjaniya Sutta')"&gt;Māratajjaniya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.332).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singālapitā is said to have retired to Bhesakalāvana for his meditations (ThagA.i.70).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grove received its name from the fact that its presiding spirit was a Yakkhinī called Bhesākalā (SA.ii.181).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.3), the Buddha spent the eight vassa at Bhesakalāvana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Divyāvadāna calls it Bhīsanikāvana.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddavāggiyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of thirty young men, converted by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had gone picnicking with their wives in a forest glade between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Bārānasi')"&gt;Bārānasi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa,Uruvelā')"&gt;Uruvelā&lt;/a&gt;.  One of them had no wife, and for him they found a courtesan; but she awaited the opportunity and ran away with their goods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While seeking for her, they saw the Buddha and enquired if he had seen a woman.  But he answered, should they not rather seek the "self" than a woman.  They all agreed thereto, and he preached to them.  At the end of the sermon they realized the Truth and were ordained (Vin.i.23f.; DhA.ii.33f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their conversion was one of the subjects sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa.

Bodhi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lived at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumsumaaragiri,Sumsumāragiri')"&gt;Sumsumāragiri&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhagga,Bhagga')"&gt;Bhagga&lt;/a&gt; country and built a palace called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokanada,Kokanada')"&gt;Kokanada&lt;/a&gt;.  When the palace was completed, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhesakalavava,Bhesakalāvana')"&gt;Bhesakalāvana&lt;/a&gt; near by, and Bodhi sent a message by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta,Sañjikāputta')"&gt;Sañjikāputta&lt;/a&gt;, inviting the Buddha to the palace, that he might bless it by being its first occupant.  The Buddha agreed to come and, the next day, arrived with the monks for a meal.  Bodhi came, with his retinue, to meet them at the foot of the steps and asked the Buddha to step on to the carpeting which was spread there.  Three times the request was made, three times the Buddha kept silence.  Thereupon &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; asked for the carpeting to be removed, saying that the Buddha's refusal to step thereon was as an example to future generations.  After the meal, Bodhi had a discussion with the Buddha (Vin.ii.127f.; M.ii.91ff), recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s,Bodhirājakumāra Sutta')"&gt;Bodhirājakumāra Sutta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary adds (MA.ii.739ff) that one of the reasons for the Buddha's refusal to step on the carpet was that he knew the thoughts of Bodhi.  Bodhi was saying to himself: "If I am to have a son, the Buddha will step on this carpet, if not, he will not." The Buddha knew also that Bodhi was not destined to have a son because in a previous life he and his wife had lived on an island and eaten young birds.  DhA.iii.137ff adds that the Buddha actually told Bodhi of the non fulfillment of his wish for a son, and related to him the story of his past life in which he and his wife ate birds' eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodhi was the son of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/udena,Udena')"&gt;Udena&lt;/a&gt;, king of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambi')"&gt;Kosambi&lt;/a&gt;, and his mother was the daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cannda_ppajjota,Candappajjota')"&gt;Candappajjota&lt;/a&gt;.  Bodhi was skilled in the art of managing elephants (see also M.ii.94), which art he learned from his father, a master in this direction.  It is said (M.ii.97) that, while Bodhi was yet in his mother's womb, she visited the Buddha at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghositaaraama,Ghositārāma')"&gt;Ghositārāma&lt;/a&gt; in Kosambī and declared that whatever child was born to her it would accept the Buddha, his teaching and the Order, as its abiding refuge.  Later, after Bodhi's birth, his nurse took him to the Buddha at Bhesakalāvana and made a similar declaration.  When, therefore, Bodhi acknowledged the Buddha as his teacher, at the conclusion of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhirajakumara_s,Bodhirājakumāra Sutta')"&gt;Bodhirājakumāra Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, he was seeking the Buddha's refuge for the third time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some accounts* of the building of Bodhi's palace add that as it was being completed, Bodhi conceived the idea of killing the architect or of blinding him so that he could never design a similar house for anyone else.  He confided this idea to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sanjikaputta,Sanjikāputta')"&gt;Sanjikāputta&lt;/a&gt;, who warned the architect.  The latter, therefore, obtained special timber from Bodhi, saying it was for the palace, and made out of it a wooden bird large enough to hold himself and his family.  When it was ready, he made it fly out of the window, and he and his family escaped to the Himālaya country, where he founded a kingdom and came to be known as King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/katthavaahana,Katthavāhana')"&gt;Katthavāhana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* E.g., DhA.iii.134ff.; in J.iii.157 it is stated briefly that Bodhi did actually blind the architect.  In a previous birth he put out the eyes of one thousand warriors.  See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhonasaakha_jat_353,Dhonasākha Jātaka')"&gt;Dhonasākha Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

While meditating in a forest tract in Kosala, he grew slothful and rough in speech.  One day the Buddha, seeing his maturing insight, appeared before him in a ray of glory and admonished him with averse.  Belatthānika was filled with agitation and soon after became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, and, while wandering about with his pupils, he saw the Buddha and offered him seven flowers.  Twenty nine kappas ago he became king under the name of Vipulābhāsa (Thag.vs.101; ThagA.i.205f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Campakapupphiya of the Apadāna.

She could travel fifteen leagues in a day (DhA.i.196).  Udena made use of her in his elopement with Vāsuladattā (DhA.i.198).  At first the king paid her great honour, declaring that his life, queen and kingdom were all due to her; her stall was smeared with perfumed earth and hung with coloured hangings, a lamp burned perfumed oil and a dish of incense was set on one side.  She stood on a coloured carpet and ate royal food of many flavours.  But when she grew old she was neglected and became destitute.  One day she saw the Buddha entering the city for alms, fell at his feet, and complained of the king's neglect.  The Buddha reported the matter to the notice of Udena, and all former honours were restored to Bhaddavatī.  This incident led to the preaching of the Dalhadhamma Jātaka.

One day he heard a brahmin soothsayer announce that if a brigand were to commence his activities under a certain combination of planets, he would conquer the whole of Ceylon.  Tissa, acting on this idea, turned robber and sent word to the king that he should hand over his throne to him.  At the same time seven Damilas, with their followers, arrived in Mahātittha with the same demand.  The king thereupon sent word to Tissa that the kingdom would be his if he could defeat the Damilas.  Tissa agreed to this and marched against them, but was taken captive in a battle near Sanketahāla.  The Pāli Commentaries give further details.  Tissa plundered the land for twelve long years; food became so scarce that, owing to starvation, people lost even their sexual desires, and the birth of a child was such a rare occurrence that all the land rejoiced over such a birth (SA.ii.83).  Tissa's activities were at their height when Vattagāmanī was in hiding.  The stores of food in Cittalapabbata vihāra and in Tissamahārāma were laid waste by enormous rats and the monks could obtain no food, Tissa having ravished the land.  They therefore sent eight Theras to Sakka, begging him to rid the country of Tissa; but Sakka sent reply that he was powerless, and suggested that the monks should go over the seas.  Some took his advice and sailed from Jambukola, but the leaders of the community &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- Samyuttabhānaka Cūlasīva, Isidatta and Mahāsona &lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;- remained behind awaiting better times (see also Nāgā Therī, whose story given in AA.ii.654f.; also MA.i.546).  The Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura was deserted; the Mahā Thūpa was overgrown with trees.  The monks had to live on lotus stalks and fruit rinds thrown away by the people.  When Brāhmanatissa died, Vattagāmanī once more came to the throne (VibhA.445&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-51).  v.l.  Brāhmanatiya cora (from which the Ceylon Chronicles derive the form Bāminitiyā).

He was conceived after Sudinna had already been ordained.  His wife came to him during her period and begged him to give her an offspring (bījaka).  As the rule against unchastity had not then been promulgated, Sudinna yielded to her importunities, thus becoming guilty of the first Pārājikā.  The son was called Bījaka, and so Sudinna came to be called Bījakapitā and the mother Bījakamātā.  Both Bījaka and his mother later left the world and became arahants.  Vin.iii.17 19; Sp.i.215f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.

Bījaka also agreed that Guna's teaching accorded with his own experience.  He remembered his previous life, when he had been born as Bhāvasetthi of Sāketa and had done many acts of virtue and piety.  But at present he was the son of a poor prostitute leading a wretched life.  Even so, he always gave half his food to any who might desire it, kept the fast, and led, in every way, a virtuous life.  But virtue, he said, was useless; it bore no fruit.  So saying, he wept.  When Rujā (q.v.) heard this, she said that Bījaka's sufferings were due to evil actions done in the past in earlier lives (J.vi.227, 228, 229, 233, 235).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast explains (J.vi.228) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, while Bījaka was seeking a lost ox, a monk enquired of him the way which he had lost.  Bījaka was angry and abused the monk, calling him a slave.  His birth as Bhāvasetthi was due to some earlier good done by him, but in this birth he became a slave.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bījaka is identified with Moggallāna (J.vi.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

On the eighth occasion, while on his way to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suvannabhuumi,Suvannabhūmi')"&gt;Suvannabhūmi&lt;/a&gt;, his ship was wrecked, and he floated ashore on a plank, reaching land near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppara,Suppāraka')"&gt;Suppāraka&lt;/a&gt;.  Having lost all his clothes, he made himself a bark garment, and went about, bowl in hand, for alms in Suppāraka.  Men, seeing his garment and struck with his demeanour, paid him great honour.  Though they offered him costly robes and many other luxuries, he refused them all and his fame increased.  Because of his bark garment he was known as Dārucīriya.  In due course he came himself to believe that he had attained arahantship, but a devatā (a Suddhāvāsa-brahmā, who had been his fellow celibate in the time of Kassapa Buddha, says the Commentary, see below and also MA.i.340), reading his thoughts and wishing him well, pointed out to him his error and advised him to seek the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;.  By the power of the devatā, Bāhiya reached Sāvatthi in one night, a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and was told that the Buddha was in the city begging alms.  Bāhiya followed him thither and begged to be taught something for his salvation.  Twice he asked and twice the Buddha refused, saying that it was not the hour for teaching.  But Bāhiya insisted, saying that life was uncertain and that the Buddha or he might die.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentaries say that Bāhiya was excited by his meeting with the Buddha and that the Buddha wished to give him time to regain his calm, hence his refusal.  The Buddha knew of his impending death and of his upanissaya for arahantship.  He was a pacchimabhavika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha then taught him the proper method of regarding all sense experiences - namely, as experiences and no more.  Even as he listened, Bāhiya became an &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/a/ariya_puggala,arahant')"&gt;arahant&lt;/a&gt; and the Buddha left him.  Shortly after, Bāhiya was gored to death by a cow with calf (cp.  the story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukkusāti')"&gt;Pukkusāti&lt;/a&gt;).  The Buddha, seeing his body lying on the dung heap, asked the monks to remove it and to have it burnt, erecting a thūpa over the remains.  In the assembly he declared Bāhiya to be foremost among those who instantly comprehended the Truth (khippābhiññānam) (A.i.24; Ud.i.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bāhiya's resolve to attain to this eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha when he heard the Buddha declare a monk foremost in instantaneous comprehension.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, when the Buddha's teachings were fading from the minds of men, Bāhiya was one of seven monks who climbed a rock, determined not to leave it until they had attained their goal.  Their leader became an arahant and the second an anāgāmī - passing into the Suddhāvāsa world; the rest were reborn in this age as Pukkusāti, Kumāra Kassapa, Dabba-Mallaputta, Sabhiya and Bāhiya.  Although Bāhiya had kept the precepts in previous births, he had never given a bowl or a robe to a monk.  For this reason the Buddha did not, at the end of his sermon, ordain him by the "ehi bhikkhu pabbajā." The Buddha knew that Bāhiya had not sufficient merit to obtain divine robes.  Some say that he was once a brigand and had shot a Pacceka Buddha with an arrow and had taken possession of the Pacceka Buddha's begging bowl and robe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bāhiya met his death while searching for a robe in which to be ordained (UdA.77ff.; AA.i.156ff.; DhA.ii.209ff.; Ap.ii.475ff).  The cow, which killed Bāhiya was identical with the one which killed &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pukkusati,Pukkusāti')"&gt;Pukkusāti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tambadaathika,Tambadāthika')"&gt;Tambadāthika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppabuddha,Suppabuddha')"&gt;Suppabuddha&lt;/a&gt; (for her story see DhA.ii.35f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Bāhiya.  &lt;/b&gt; A Damila usurper who reigned in Anurādhapura for two years (between 43 and 29 B.C.).  He was commander in chief of Pulahattha whom he slew, being himself, in turn, slain by his own commander in chief, Panayamāra.  Mhv.xxxiii.56ff.; Dpv.xx.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Bāhiya.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk.  He is said to have, come to the Buddha asking for a teaching in brief and the Buddha told him to dwell on the impermanence of the senses and of sense objects.  Profiting by the lesson, Bāhiya dwelt apart and, putting forth effort, soon became an arahant (S.iv.63f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is perhaps the same monk - called Bāhiya or Bāhika - who is mentioned elsewhere (S.v.165f) as asking for the Buddha for a lesson and being told to meditate on the four satipatthānas.  This contemplation led to arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bāhiya.  &lt;/b&gt; A monk, fellow dweller of Anuruddha at the Ghositārāma.  He seems to have taken a prominent part in the disputes of the Kosambī monks, helping them, but Anuruddha let him take his own way, not protesting at all.  A.ii.239; cf.  KhA.115.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bāhiya, Bāhika.&lt;/b&gt; The name of a country, residence of Bharata, the hunter mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/atthasadda_jat,Atthasadda Jātaka')"&gt;Atthasadda Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.432).  See also&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bahiya_jat_108,Bāhiya Jātaka')"&gt;Bāhiya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bodhirukka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generic name given to the tree under which a Buddha attains Enlightenment (D.A.ii.416).  The tree is different in the case of each Buddha.  Thus, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Gotama and also for Kondañña it was an asvattha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Dīpankara a sirīsa; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Mangala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita a nāga; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Anomadassī an ajjuna; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Paduma and Nārada a mahāsona; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Padumuttara a salala; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Sumedha a nimba; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Sujāta a bamboo; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Piyadassī a kakudha; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Atthadassī a campaka; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Dhammadassī a bimbajāla; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Siddhattha a kanikāra; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Tissa an asana; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Phussa an āmanda; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Vipassī a pātalī; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Sikhī a pundarīka; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Vessabhū a sāla; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Kakusandha a sirīsa; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Konāgamma an udumbara; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;for Kassapa a banyan (see passim; the details differ some what at BuA.247).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site of the Bodhi tree is the same for all Buddhas (BuA.247), and it forms the navel of the earth (J.iv.233) (puthuvinābhi).  No other place can support the weight of the Buddha's attainment.  J.iv.229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When no Bodhi tree grows, the Bodhimanda (ground round the Bodhi&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;-tree), for a distance of one royal karīsa, is devoid of all plants, even of any blade of grass, and is quite smooth, spread with sand like a silver plate, while all around it are grass, creepers and trees.  None can travel in the air immediately above it, not even Sakka (J.iv.232f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the world is destroyed at the end of a kappa, the Bodhimanda is the last spot to disappear; when the world emerges into existence again, it is the first to appear.  A lotus springs there bringing it into view and if during the kappa thus begun a Buddha will be born, the lotus puts forth flowers, according to the number of Buddhas (DA.ii.412).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Gotama Buddha, his Bodhi tree sprang up on the day he was born (DA.ii.425; BuA.248).  After his Enlightenment, he spent a whole week in front of it, standing with unblinking eyes, gazing at it with gratitude.  A shrine was later erected on the spot where he so stood, and was called the Animisalocana cetiya (q.v.).  The spot was used as a shrine even in the lifetime of the Buddha, the only shrine that could be so used.  While the Buddha was yet alive, in order that people might make their offerings in the name of the Buddha when he was away on pilgrimage, he sanctioned the planting of a seed from the Bodhi tree in Gayā in front of the gateway of Jetavana.  For this purpose Moggallāna took a fruit from a tree at Gayā as it dropped from its stalk, before it reached the ground.  It was planted in a golden jar by Anāthapindika with great pomp and ceremony.  A sapling immediately sprouted forth, fifty cubits high, and in order to consecrate it the Buddha spent one night under it, wrapt in meditation.  This tree, because it was planted under the direction of Ananda, came to be known as the Ananda Bodhi (J.iv.228ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Ceylon Chronicles (e.g., Mhv.xv), branches from the Bodhi trees of all the Buddhas born during this kappa were planted in Ceylon on the spot where the sacred Bodhi tree stands today in Anurādhapura.  The branch of Kakusandha's tree was brought by a nun called Rucānandā, Konagamana's by Kantakānandā (or Kanakadattā), and Kassapa's by Sudhammā.  Asoka was most diligent in paying homage to the Bodhi tree, and held a festival every year in its honour in the month of Kattika (Mhv.xvii.17).  His queen, Tissarakkhā was jealous of the Tree, and three years after she became queen (i.e., in the nineteenth year of Asoka's reign), she caused the tree to be killed by means of mandu thorns (Mhv.xx.4f).  The tree, however, grew again, and a great monastery was attached to the Bodhimanda.  Among those present at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa are mentioned thirty thousand monks, from this Vihāra, led by Cittagutta (Mhv.xxix.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittisirimegha of Ceylon, contemporary of Samudragupta, erected with the permission of Samudragupta, a Sanghārāma near the Mahābodhi-vihāra, chiefly for the use of the Singhalese monks who went to worship the Bodhi tree.  The circumstances in connection with the Sanghārāma are given by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., 133ff) who gives a description of it as seen by himself.  It was probably here that Buddhaghosa met the Elder Revata who persuaded him to come to Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the twelfth year of Asoka's reign the right branch of the Bodhi tree was brought by Sanghamittā to Anurādhapura and placed by Devānāmpiyatissa in the Mahāmeghavana.  The Buddha, on his death bed, had resolved five things, one being that the branch which should be taken to Ceylon should detach itself (Mhv.xvii.46f).  From Gayā, the branch was taken to Pātaliputta, thence to Tāmalittī, where it was placed in a ship and taken to Jambukola, across the sea; finally it arrived at Anurādhapura, staying on the way at Tivakka.  Those who assisted the king at the ceremony of the planting of the Tree were the nobles of Kājaragāma and of Candanagāma and of Tivakka.  From the seeds of a fruit which grew on the tree sprang eight saplings, which were planted respectively &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;at Jambukola, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in the village of Tivakka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;at Thūpārāmā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;at Issaramanārāma, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in the court of the Pathamacetiya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in Cetiyagiri, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in Kājaragāma and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in Candanagāma (Mhv.xix.60ff.; for details in connection with the bringing of the Bodhitree, see Mbv.144 ff).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two other saplings, from four other fruits, were planted here and there at a distance of one yojana.  Ceremonies were instituted in honour of the Tree, the supervision of which was given over to Bodhāhārakula, at the head of which were the eight ministers of Asoka who, led by Bodhigutta and Sumitta (see Mbv.165f., for the names of the others), were sent as escorts of the Tree.  Revenues were provided for these celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, King Dhātusena built a Bodhighara or roof over the Tree (Cv.xxxviii.431) while Silākāla made daily offerings at the shrine (see Cv.Trs.i.32, n.  6; Cv.xli.29), and Kittisirimegha had the Bodhighara covered with tin plates (Cv.xli.65).  Mahānāga had the roof of the Bodhighara gilded, built a trench round the courtyard and set up Buddha images in the image house (Cv.xli.94).  Aggabodhi I.  erected a stone terrace round the Tree and placed, at the bottom of it, an oil pit to receive the oil for illuminations on festival days (Cv.xlii.19).  Aggabodhi II.  had a well dug for the use of pilgrims (Cv.xlii.66), and Moggallāna III.  held a great celebration in the Tree's honour (Cv.xliv.45).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggabodhi VII found the Bodhighara in ruins and had it rebuilt (Cv.xlviii.70); Mahinda II instituted a regular offering in its honour (Cv.xlviii.124), and Udaya III gave a village near Anurādhapura to the service of the Bodhi tree.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhanda, Bhandu Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colleague of Ananda whom Kassapa reported to the Buddha at Veluvana for disputing with Abhiñjaka, colleague of Anuruddha.  The Buddha sent for the disputants and rebuked them for their contentiousness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They confessed their fault and were pardoned.  S.ii.204f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhātiyavanka vihāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery in Ceylon.  A monk of the monastery, who once went to worship at the Mahā Thūpa, saw there some devatās also worshipping; they had been born in heaven as a result of having participated in the building of the thūpa (Mhv.xxx.46f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Dutthagāmanī, the chief incumbent of the vihāra was Mahānāga.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bandhura&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief groom of the elephant house of the king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  Bandhura had only one eye.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crow built her nest over the doorway of the elephant house, laid there her eggs and hatched out her young.  But every time Bandhura entered or left the stable on the back of the elephant, he struck the crow's nest with his hook, thus destroying it.  The crow, in despair, made complaint, and her cry was one of the sounds mentioned in the &lt;b&gt;Atthasadda Jātaka&lt;/b&gt;.  When the king discovered how Bandhura was acting, he rebuked him and dismissed him from his service.  J.iii.430 f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;h2&gt;Brahmāli Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a brahmin family of Kosala, and, through association with spiritually minded friends and his own realization of the ills of samsāra, he entered the Order.  Dwelling in the forest he soon developed insight and acquired arahantship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder, and, seeing the Buddha going on his alms rounds, he gave him a vāra-fruit.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhāradvāja Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Udena visits Pindola Bhāradvāja at the Ghositārāma and asks how it is that young men in their prime should leave the world and yet live to the full the righteous life.  Pindola answers that these young men regard all women as mothers, sisters, or daughters.  They regard the body as full of manifold impurities, and abide watchful over the doors of the senses.  Udena is pleased with the explanation and accepts the Buddha's teaching.  S.iv.110f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddā-Kundalakesā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Therī.  She was foremost among nuns, of swift intuition, and was born in the family of a treasurer of Rājagaha.  On the same day, a son was born to the king's chaplain under a constellation favourable to highwaymen, and was therefore called &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sattuka,Sattuka')"&gt;Sattuka&lt;/a&gt;.  One day, through her lattice, Bhaddā saw Sattuka being led by the city guard to execution on a charge of robbery.  She fell at once in love with him and refused to live without him.  Her father, out of his love for her, bribed the guard to release Sattuka, let him be bathed in perfumed water, and brought him home, where Bhaddā, decked in jewels, waited upon him.  Very soon, Sattuka began to covet her jewels and told her that he had made a vow to the deity of the Robbers' Cliff that, should he escape, he would bring him an offering.  She trusted him and, making ready an offering, went with him arrayed in all her ornaments.  On arriving at the top of the cliff, he told her of his purpose, and she, all undaunted, begged of him to let her embrace him on all sides.  He agreed to this, and then, making as if to embrace him from the back, she pushed him over the cliff.  The deity of the mountain praised her presence of mind saying that men were not in all cases wiser than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unwilling to return home after what had happened; she joined the Order of the white robed Niganthas.  As she wished to practise extreme austerities, they dragged out her hair with a palmyra comb.  Her hair grew again in close curls, and so they called her Kundala-kesā ("Curly-hair").  Dissatisfied with the teaching of the Niganthas, she left them, and going to various teachers, became very, proficient in discussion and eager for debate.  She would enter a village and, making a heap of sand at the gate, set up the branch of a rose apple saying, "Whoever wishes to enter into discussion with me, let him trample on this bough." One day, Sāriputta, seeing the bough outside Sāvatthi, ordered some children to trample on it.  Bhaddā then went to Jetavana accompanied by a large crowd whom she had invited to be present at the discussion.  Sāriputta suggested that Bhaddā should first ask him questions; to all of these he replied until she fell silent.  It was then his turn, and he asked "One what is that?" (probably meaning: "state any one fact true for everyone") She, unable to answer, asked him to be her teacher.  But Sāriputta sent her to the Buddha, who preached to her that it were better to know one single stanza bringing calm and peace than one thousand verses bringing no profit.  At the end of this sermon, Bhaddā attained arahantship, and the Buddha himself ordained her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she had heard him preach and place as foremost among nuns one whose intuition was swift (khippābhiññā).  She vowed that this rank should one day be hers.  Later, when Kassapa was Buddha, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king of Benares, and was named Bhikkhadāyikā (v.l.  Bhikkhudāsikā).  For twenty thousand years she remained celibate and built a dwelling for the Order.  A.i.25; AA.i.200ff.; ThigA.99ff.; Ap.ii.560ff.  The DhA.  Account (ii.  217 ff.) differs in various details.  There Bhaddā is shut up by her parents at the top of a seven storied building with only a single woman to wait on her, for "girls when young, burn for men!" It was thus that she saw the robber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Therīgāthā (Thig.vss.107-11) are included several verses spoken by her when she had been a nun for fifty years, wandering about in Anga, Magadha, Kāsi and Kosala, living on the people's alms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bhaddavatiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samavati,Simāvati')"&gt;Simāvati&lt;/a&gt;; he was a setthi of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaddavatii,Bhaddavatī')"&gt;Bhaddavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He formed a close friendship with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/ghosaka_setthi,Ghositasetthi')"&gt;Ghositasetthi&lt;/a&gt; of Kosambī, through the medium of traders and, when Bhaddavatī was attacked by plague, he left with his wife and daughter to visit Ghositasetthi.  But he died of starvation outside the city before he could reach him.  DhA.i.187f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amoraphaliya Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety-one kappas ago he gave an amora-fruit to Vipassī Buddha (Ap.ii.447).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verses ascribed to him in the Apadāna are, in the Theragāthā Commentary, attributed to two monks, Isidatta (ThagA.i.238) and Gotama (Ibid., i.256) (v.l.  Amodaphaliya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambāmacca&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Venigāma.  He was very rich; but once, during a drought, there being no food, he made ready to go to the mountains with his retinue.  Just before starting they found a measure of rice, and, having cooked it, were about to eat it, when Amba saw Cūlapindapātika-Nāga Thera returning from the village with empty bowl.  He invited the monk and gave him the food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera retired into the forest and attained arahantship before eating it.  Tired and hungry, Amba slept, and, on waking, asked his wife if any scrapings were left.  She went into the kitchen and found the pot full of food, which they shared with the whole village.  Ras.ii.145f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayamātā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Therī.  She was a courtesan named Padumavatī, the belle of Ujjenī.  King Bimbisāra, having heard of her beauty, expressed to his purohita a wish to see her.  The purohita, by the power of his spells, enlisted the assistance of a Yakkha, Kumbhīra, who took the king to Ujjeni.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She bore to the king a son, Abhayarājakumāra, who later joined the Order and became an arahant.  It was on his account that Padumavatī came to be called Abhayamātā.  She heard Abhayarājakumāra preach and leaving the world herself became an arahant (ThigA.31-2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses attributed to her are found in the Therigatha (33,34).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of the Buddha Tissa, seeing him going round for alms, with glad heart she gave him a spoonful of food.  As a result, she was thirty-six times queen among the gods and was chief queen of fifty cakkavattis (ThigA.32).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is evidently identical with Katacchubhikkhadāyikā of the Apadāna (ii.516-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accuta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Accuta.-A treasurer who, in Kakusandha's time, built a sanghā-rāma of golden bricks on the spot where, later, Anāthapindika built the Jetavanārāma (J.i.94; ApA.i.82).  He was the chief lay disciple of Kakusandha and was a Mahāsāla-setthi.  DA.ii.424; see also Bv.xxiii.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Accuta.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of Pacceka Buddhas.  M.iii.70; ApA.i.106-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Accuta.-A hermit, black-toothed and with matted hair, who lived in the Vanka forest near Vankagiri.  He directed Jūjaka to Vessantara's dwelling in the forest (J.vi.532).  He was a previous incarnation of Sāriputta (J.vi.593).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambatittha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in the Cetiya country near Bhaddavatikā.  When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatittha as in the Jatila's hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nāga.  While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jatila's hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace.  The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers.  Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī.  The fame of the Elder's victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him.  He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha.  The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pācittiya-offence.

The four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthānā')"&gt;satipatthānā&lt;/a&gt; form the sole way that leads to the purification of beings, and to the realisation of Nibbana, etc.  S.v.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambapāli Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A conversation between Anuruddha and Sāriputta in Ambālivana.  Sāriputta asks the reason of Anuruddha's serenity and beauty of complexion.  It is due to the practice of the four &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthānā')"&gt;satipatthānā&lt;/a&gt;, says Anuruddha; he himself spends all his time in the practice of them, and so generally do all arahants.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajagara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peta who lived in Gijjhakūta.  He was seen there by Mogallāna, but not by Moggallāna's companion Lakkhana Thera.  Later, in answer to a question by Lakkhana Thera, the Buddha revealed the peta's past.  He had been a bandit in Kassapa Buddha's time, and having been unintentionally offended by the treasurer Sumangala, who had built a Gandhakuti for Kassapa, he sought to take revenge on him and to make him angry by committing various heinous crimes against him.  But the latter showed no wrath, and once, after having given aims to the Buddha, he gave over the merit, so gained, to the bandit.  He thereupon repented, but his evil kamma was too great for him to be able to win any special attainment.  DhA.iii.60ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambatthala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little tableland immediately below the Silakūta of the Missaka Mountain in Ceylon.  It was near here that Mahinda and his companions alighted after their aerial journey from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xiii.20).  There King Mahādāthika-Mahānāga built the Ambatthala Thūpa, risking his own life in order to make the building secure.  He made a cover for the whole thūpa and, at its dedication, held the great Giribhandapūjā (Mhv.xxiv.68-81).  Kanitthatissaka built a monastery attached to the thūpa (Mhv.xxxvi.9), which Gothābhaya renovated (Mhv.xxxvi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihāra was rebuilt or enlarged by Dhātusena.  He intended to give it into the charge of the Theravādins, but ultimately gave it to the Dhammarucikas at the latters' request (Cv.xxxviii.76).  Sirimeghavanna had a life-size golden image of Mahinda placed in the Ambatthala Cetiya (Cv.xxxvii.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the place was so called after the riddle of the mango tree (Mhv.xiv.17ff.) with which Mahinda put Devānampiyatissa's discernment to the test.  Even now mango trees are planted near the ceitya in memory of the event (Cv.trans.  i.4. n.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other names for the place are Cetiyambatthala (Cv.xxxvii.69) and Therambatthalaka (Mhv.xxxvi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambatthakola&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district in Ceylon near the modern Kurunegala, fifty-five miles from Anurādhapura.  When Dutthagāmani planned to build the Mahā Thūpa silver appeared near a cave in this district by the power of the devas and was discovered by a merchant who reported the find to the king; the king himself came to gather the silver for the thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.20-35; MT.512).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Amandagāmani Abhaya built the Rajatalena Vihāra here (Mhv.xxxv.4, 5).  It was in this district, in the neighbourhood of the Kuthāri Vihāra, that Moggallāna defeated his brother the parricide Kassapa I.  (Cv.xxxix.21ff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā it was in Ambatthakola that King Mahācūlī Mahātissa worked in Sonnagiri in a sugar mill to earn money for an alms-giving (MT.624; Mhv.xxxiv.4f ) (v.l.  Ambatthakolalena).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

She saw the Buddha going on his begging round, and having nothing else to offer, gave him, with very pious heart, some dried flesh, old and salt less.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thought constantly of her gift, and after death was born in a vimāna in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; came across her and heard from her story' (v.l.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambanganatthāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spot where Devānampiyatissa gave a mango to Mahinda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder ate the mango and had the stone planted in the ground.  Immediately a tree grew from it and the earth trembled.  The Elder declared that the spot would become a place of assembly for the Sangha of Ceylon and would be called Ambangana.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhiseka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of a statue of the Buddha in the Abhayagiri-vihāra.  King Dhātusena had a golden ornament made for it (Cv.xxxviii.67), and in the time of Kassapa I., a senāpati, named Migira, built a house for it (Cv.xxxix.6).  Migāra also instituted a dedication festival for "Abhiseka Buddha.'' Ibid., 40; see also Geiger's trans, i.35, n.7; 36, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adhamma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kāmāvacara god, Devadatta, in a previous birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He appeared to men on fast days and admonished them to lead evil lives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he met Dhamma (the Bodhisatta), and the two had a discussion in mid-air, at the end of which Adhamma plunged headlong into hell (J.iv.100-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vehicle was called Adhammayāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhidhammattha-sangaha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compendium of the Abhidhamma written by Anuruddha, incumbent of the Mūlasoma Vihāra (For details see P.L.C.  168-72).  A tīkā called the Porāna Tīkā exists, written by Navavimalabuddhi of Ceylon (Compendium of Philosophy, Preface ix).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other explanatory works on the Abhidhammattha-sangaha are those by Sumangala and Chappata, the Sīhalavyākhyāna by Candagomi, the Anutīkā by Vepullabuddhi, two Navānutīkā, one by Ariyavamsa and the second by an unknown author, and a Vivarana.  See Sas.69. 71; Svd.1202, 1223; Gv.  64, 65, 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gv.(p.71) the work was written at the request of an upāsaka named Nambha (Nampa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acela Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Acela Sutta.-Contains a series of questions asked of the Buddha by a paribbājaka named Acela-Kassapa, probably Acela-Kassapa (3).  S.ii.18f.  (See Appendix.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Acela Sutta.-Contains the story of the conversion of Acela-Kassapa (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Amata Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Buddha teaches the Deathless and the path thereto.  S.iv.370.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Amata Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Dwell with mind well established in the four Satipatthānā, but let not that be to you the Deathless, i.e.  do not confuse the means with the end.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggidatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Aggidatta.-Chaplain to the King of Kosala, first to Mahākosala, and then to his son Pasenadi.  Later he renounced the world and, with a large band of followers, wandered about Anga, Magadha and Kururattha,, teaching a cult of nature-worship.  The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, sent Moggallāna to convert him.  Moggallāna went to Aggidatta's hermitage, but being refused shelter there, vanquished, by a display of iddhi-power, a nāgarāja, Ahicchatta, who lived in the neighbourhood, and occupied the nāga's abode.  While Aggidatta and his followers stand awestruck at this event, the Buddha appears, and realising that the Buddha is even greater than Moggallāna, they pay homage to him.  The Buddha preaches to them on the error of their ways.  At the end of the discourse they become arahants (DhA.iii.241-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Benares and father of the Bodhisatta, when the latter was born as Somadatta.  The old man lived by ploughing, and one of his oxen having died, he decided, on the advice of his son, to ask the king for an ox.  Somadatta, with great patience, trained him in all the formalities to be gone through in an appearance at court, but at the crucial moment when Aggidatta was making his petition to the king, he used the word "take" where he meant to use "give." Somadatta's presence of mind saved the situation (DhA.iii.124-5).  In the Somadatta Jātaka the name Aggidatta does not appear.  In the present age he was the Thera Lāludāyī.  J.ii.164f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Khemavatī, father of the Buddha Kakusandha.  His wife was named Visākhā.  D.ii.7; Bv.xxiii.14; J.i.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Aggidatta.-See Gahvaratīriya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambattha-gotta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clan to which Ambattha-mānava belonged.  The Kanhāyana-gotta was probably one of its chief sections, or, perhaps, the family of its original ancestors.  In the Buddha's time the clan was evidently considered very aristocratic, at least by its own members, for they looked down upon even the Sākiyans as scorings from their kinsmen's feet, though the Sākiyans themselves seem to have laughed at the pretensions of the Ambatthas (See Ambattha-mānava above).  Nor were the Ambatthas brahmins by birth; some of them were farmers and traders and some even sold their daughters for gold.  J.iv.363; they were called brahmins by courtesy vohāravasena (ibid., 366).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mānavadhammasāstra, they were not sprung from Ksatriya father and a slave (presumably Sudra) mother, as given in the Ambattha Sutta, but from a brahmin father and a Vaisya mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ambatthas were of an old stock and were well known.  Besides the Ambattha-mānava mentioned above, another Ambattha, called Sūra, is spoken of in the Pitakas (E.g., A.i.26; iii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahicchatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A king of the Nāgas.  He lived in the heap of sand which was made by Aggidatta (q.v.) and his followers, who had made a vow to bring from somewhere a jar of sand and empty it at an agreed spot whenever a sinful thought occurred to them.  When Moggallāna visited Aggidatta and asked him for a lodging, Aggidatta refused to give him one, but Moggallāna, in spite of his protests, occupied the sand-hill.  Moggallāna overcame the power of the Nāga king by his iddhi-power, and when Aggidatta and his followers visited him the next morning, they found Ahicchatta standing with his hood over Moggallāna's head as protection for him from the sun.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayebalākapāsāna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A locality in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"&gt;Anurādhapura&lt;/a&gt;, one of the spots included in the Sīmā (boundary) marked out by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa,Devānampiyatissa')"&gt;Devānampiyatissa&lt;/a&gt; (Mhv.xv.13; see Appendix B of Geiger's text).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhayavaapi,Abhayavāpi')"&gt;Abhayavāpi&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggikkhandopama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached by the Buddha while touring in Kosala with a large concourse of monks, the sight of a blazing fire being made the occasion for the discourse.  It were better for a man to seek shelter in, embrace and lie down upon the raging flames than to live in the guise of a monk and accept the alms of the faithful while being guilty of evil conduct (A.iv.128f).  It is said that while the sutta was being preached sixty monks vomited hot blood, sixty left the Order in diffidence and sixty others became arahants (A.iv.135).  The Commentary adds that the Buddha foresaw this result, and that later many of the monks, hearing of the discourse and fearing dire consequences for themselves, returned to the lay-life in such large numbers that the Order became rapidly depleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was to counteract this result that the Cūlaccharāsanghāta Sutta was preached (AA.i.38-40).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta is mentioned as an example of a sermon based on some immediate experience, in this case, a fire (MA.i.14; also AA.i.32, 267).  It was preached by Mahinda in Ceylon, in the Nandana pleasance, on the day the Mahāmeghavana was gifted to the Sangha (Mhv.xv.176; Mbv.133); and also by Yonaka Dhammarakhita, in Aparantaka (Mhv.xii.34; Mbv.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vomiting of hot blood, mentioned here, is made the subject of a dilemma in the Milinda (p.164).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahigundika Jātaka (No.  365)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a snake-charmer in Benares who had also a tame monkey.  Once, during a festival, he left the monkey with a corn-factor (the Bodhisatta) and set out to earn money by making sport with the snake.  The monkey was well looked after by the Bodhisatta.  Seven days later the snake-charmer returned drunk and ill-treated the monkey.  When the man was asleep the monkey escaped and refused to come back in spite of his former owner's fine words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told with reference to a novice who was ordained by a distinguished Elder.  The Elder ill-treated the lad who, in exasperation, left the Order.  The Elder persuaded him to return, but when this had happened twice again, the lad refused to come back (J.iii.197-9).  The novice is identified with the monkey of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amarā (Amarādevī)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Mahosadha.  She was the daughter of a merchant who had fallen on evil days.  Mahosadha, while seeking for a wife, met her as she was taking a meal to her father and entered into conversation with her.  He asked her various questions and she answered in riddles.  Mahosadha went to her father's house and plied his trade as a tailor, taking the opportunity of observing the girl's behaviour.  He tested her temper and her character in various ways, and being satisfied that she was altogether desirable, he married her with the approval of Queen Udumbarā.  She became popular with everybody and was of great assistance to her husband in frustrating the attempts of his enemies to work him harm (J.vi.364-72, 392; the story appears also in Mtu.ii.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present age Amarā was the beautiful Bimbādevī (J.vi.478).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milinda (pp.205ff ) the king mentions the story of Amarādevī having been left behind in the village while her husband was away on a journey, and of her resisting a temptation to be unfaithful to him.  "If that be true, how," asks the king, "could you justify the Buddha's statement (*) that all women will go wrong, failing others, even with a cripple?" Nāgasena explains this by saying that Amarā did not sin because she had neither real secrecy nor opportunity nor the right-wooer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*) Incidentally, these words do not really belong to the Buddha.  They appear in the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.435), which is a specimen of Indian folklore and not of Buddhist belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajita-mānava&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the disciples of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bavari,Bāvarī')"&gt;Bāvarī&lt;/a&gt; who visited the Buddha at the request of their teacher.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the first to question the Buddha, and the questions asked by him form the Ajitamānavapucchā of the Parāyana Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta (Sn.197f).  At the end of the conversation he became arahant with a thousand followers and entered the Order (SnA.587, but see ThagA.  [infra], where he is said to have become an arahant later).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of a Brahmin of Sāvatthi, price-assessor (aggāsaniya) to the King of Kosala (ThagA.i.73f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (i.184) he was the nephew of Bāvarī, and the latter particularly asked him to come back to him with news of the interview with the Buddha (ThagA.loc cit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous birth he offered a kapittha-fruit to Vipassī Buddha.  He is probably to be identified with the Kapittha-phaladāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.449).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A verse attributed to Ajita-mānava is found in the Theragāthā (v.20).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ajita-pucchā are referred to in the Samyutta, (ii.47f) where they are expounded by the Buddha to Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajjuka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk of Vesālī.  In settling a dispute regarding the estate of his lay-supporter, he was accused of partisanship by one of the parties concerned and was reported to Ananda.  The case went up before Upāli, who decided in favour of Ajjuka (Vin.iii.66-7), and was commended by the Buddha for this decision.  ThagA.i.370; AA.i.172.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alagakkonāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eminent prince of Ceylon in the time of Vikkamabāhu IV.  He was of the Giri family and lived in Peraddonī (modern Perādeniya).  The Cūlavamsa does not recount much of him, save that he was full of virtue and piety and that he did many good deeds, such as the advancement of the Order; also that he was the founder of Jayavaddhanakotta, which soon after became the capital of Ceylon (Cv.xci.3-9).  The Sinhalese chronicles, however (See Cv.Trs.ii.212, n.4), tell us a good deal about him, the most important fact being that he succeeded in breaking the power of the Jaffna king which was then at its height.  Formerly it was believed that Alagakkonāra later became king under the name of Bhuvanekabāhu V., but now that opinion has been given up.  Ibid., 213, n.4, and the references given there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amba Jātaka &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Amba Jātaka (No.  124).&lt;/b&gt;-During a very severe drought a hermit, living in the Himālaya at the head of five hundred ascetics, provided water for the animals, using the hollowed trunk of a tree as trough.  In gratitude the animals brought him various fruits, enough for himself and his five hundred companions.  The story is related regarding a brother who was very zealous in his duties, doing everything well and wholeheartedly.  Because of his great goodness the people fed regularly every day five hundred of the Brethren.  J.i.449-51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Amba Jātaka (No.  474).&lt;/b&gt;-The story of a brahmin youth who learnt a charm from a wise Candāla.  The charm had the power of making lovely and fragrant mangoes grow out of season.  The youth exhibited his skill before the king, but when asked the name of his teacher he lied and said he had been taught in Takkasilā.  Immediately the charm escaped his memory and all his power deserted him.  At the king's suggestion he went back to the teacher to ask his forgiveness and to learn the charm anew, but the teacher would have none of him and the youth wandered away into the forest and died there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; who had repudiated the Buddha as his teacher and as a result was born in Avīci (J.iv.200-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youth was a former birth of Devadatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggika Jātaka (No.  129)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a jackal, who, when his hair is singed by a forest fire, pretends to be a saint of the name of Bhāradvāja and eats the rats that trust him.  J.i.461f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

On the occasion of the preaching, as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; with his retinue came to visit the Buddha, the village was bathed in radiance (D.ii.263f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name arose from the fact that the village lay in the vicinity of many mango groves.  DA.iii.697.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amarapura&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city of Burma, founded by King Bodópayā (Bode, p.74; Sās.130).  The Elder Nānābhivamsa lived there and was head of the group of monks known as the Amarapura sect.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These monks, later, took to Ceylon a number of Pāli texts, these being either of Burmese authorship or else better known to the Burmese fraternity than to the Sinhalese.  Bode, p.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Akanitthā devā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of devas, living in the highest of the five Suddhāvasā (Pure Mansions) (D.iii.237).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapadana_s,Mahāpadāna Sutta')"&gt;Mahāpadāna Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.52f) the Buddha mentions that he visited their abode and conversed with beings who were born there as a result of the holy lives they had lived under various Buddhas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.286) &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; speaks of them as the highest devas, and expresses his satisfaction that he, too, will be born among them in his last life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says they are so called because of their supremacy in virtue and in happiness, and because there are no juniors among them (sabbeh'eva sagunehi ca bhavasampattiyā ca jetthā n'atth'ettha kanitthāti akanitthā).  DA.ii.480. VbhA.521 [āyunā ca paññaya ca Akanitthā jetthakā sabba-devehi panītatarā devā (=DA.iii.739)].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visuddhi_magga,Visuddhi Magga')"&gt;Visuddhi Magga&lt;/a&gt; (p.  634) their world is spoken of as a Brahma loka where Anāgāmīs are born and enter complete Nibbāna (p.  710) (also ItA.40; DA.iii.740).  The duration of life among these devas is 16,000 Kalpas (Kvu.207).  Sometimes Anāgāmī are born among the Avihā devas and finish their existence, in a subsequent birth, among the Akanitthās.  These are called "Uddhamsotā." (DhA.iii.289f.; see also S.v.201).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Akanittha-bhavana is the upper limit of the rūpvacara-bhūmi (Ps.i.84); it is also spoken of as the highest point of the universe, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/aviici,Avīci')"&gt;Avīci&lt;/a&gt; being the lowest.  Thus the quarrel among the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosambii,Kosambī')"&gt;Kosambī&lt;/a&gt; monks spread even up to the Akanitthā devā (J.iii.487), as did the shouts of the assembly at the severing of the branch of the Bodhi tree (Mbv.  150-1; see also Mil.  284).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggapandita&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A native of Burma and author of the Lokuppattipakarana, written at Pagan in the thirteenth century (Gv.64, 67).  The Pitakatthamain calls the work Lokuppattipakāsanī (Bode, 16, n.3).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sāsanavamsa (74) speaks of three monks by the name of Aggapandita: Mahā-Aggapandita (evidently our author), Dutiya-Aggapandita (his saddhivihārika), and Tatiya-Aggapandlita (his nephew), all of Arimaddanapura and all famed for their learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambalatthikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ambalatthikā.&lt;/b&gt;-A royal park on the road between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"&gt;Nālandā&lt;/a&gt;.  It contained a royal rest-house (rājāgāraka) in which the Buddha and members of the Order used to stay in the course of their journeying.  It was on one such occasion that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmajala_s,Brahmajāla Sutta')"&gt;Brahmajāla Sutta&lt;/a&gt; was preached (Vin.ii.287; D.i.1).  Buddhaghosa (DA.i.41-2) says that it was a shady and well-watered park, so called because of a mango sapling which stood by the gateway.  It was surrounded and well guarded by a rampart, and its rest-house was adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the spots in which the Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he discoursed to a large number of monks (D.ii.81; he remained there one night, UdA.408).  But the most famous of the Buddha's sermons in Ambalatthikā seems to have been the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahulovaada_s,Rāhulovāda Sutta')"&gt;Rāhulovāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; named Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta, because of its having been preached in the park (M.i.414ff).  From the context it appears as though Ambalatthikā was within walking distance from the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But see below (4) for a more probable explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambalatthikā.&lt;/b&gt;-A park in the brahmin village Khānumata.  The Buddha went there during one of his tours through Magadha.  On this occasion was preached the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutadanta_s,Kūtadanta Sutta')"&gt;Kūtadanta Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.127).  Buddhaghosa (DA.i.294) says the park was like the pleasance of the same name between Rājagaha and Nālandā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ambalatthikā.&lt;/b&gt;-There was a place of this name to the east of the Lohapāsāda in Anurādhapura.  Once when the Dīghabhānaka Theras recited the Brahmajāla Sutta there, the earth trembled from the water upwards (DA.i.131).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion King Vasabha heard the Dīghabhānakas reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta, and thinking that they were discussing what they had eaten and drunk, he approached closer to listen; when he discovered the truth he applauded the monks (DA.ii.635).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The place referred to here was probably not a park, but a building which formed part of the Lohapāsāda.  In the Mahāvamsa account (Mhv.xxvii.11-20) of the building of the Lohapāsāda we are told that the plans were copied from the gem-palace of the goddess Bīranī.  The central part of the palace was called the Ambalatthikapāsāda.  "It was visible from every side, bright, with pennons hung out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutthagāmani probably included a similar central part in the Lohapāsāda.  This view is strengthened by No.  4 below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ambalatthikā.&lt;/b&gt;-According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.635), the Ambalatthikā, in which the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahulovaada_s,Rāhulovāda Sutta')"&gt;Rāhulovāda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; of that name was preached, was not a pleasance, but a pāsāda, a kind of meditation hall (padhānagharasankhepa) built in the outskirts of Veluvanavihāra for the use of those who desired solitude.  It is said that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raahula,Rāhula')"&gt;Rāhula&lt;/a&gt; spent most of his time there, from the day of his ordination as a seven-year-old boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abbhantara Jātaka (No.  281)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sister Bimbādevī had suffered from flatulence, and was cured with mango-juice and sugar which Sāriputta had obtained from the king of Kosala, at Rāhula's request.  The king, having heard of Bimbādevī's affliction, ordered that she should be continually supplied with mango-syrup.  On being told of the incident, the Buddha revealed this story of the past to show that it was not the first time that Sāriputta had obtained mango-syrup for Bimbādevī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atītavatthu is about the chief queen of a king of Benares.  Sakka, becoming nervous on account of the austerities of an ascetic, wishes to destroy him, and arouses in the queen a desire for a "Midmost Mango" (Abbhantara-Amba).  After prolonged search - during which the ascetic and his companions are driven from the royal park because they are reported to have eaten the mangoes there - a favourite parrot of the palace is commissioned to find the Midmost Mango.  He goes to Himavā, and learns from the parrots of the seventh mountain range that the mango grows on a tree which belongs to Vessavana and which is most strictly guarded.  He goes stealthily by night to the tree, but is caught by the guardian goblins, who decide to kill him.  He tells them that he is delighted to die in the performance of his duty, and thereby wins their respect.  Following their counsel, he seeks the assistance of an ascetic, Jotirasa, living in a hut called Kañcanapatti, to whom Vessavana sends a daily offering of four mangoes.  The ascetic gives the parrot two mangoes, one for himself and one for the queen.  J.ii.392-400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda was the parrot and Sāriputta Jotirasa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajita&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ajita.-&lt;/b&gt; A monk.  He devoted his time to explaining the Pātimokkha rules to the monks.  At the time of the Second Council he was a monk of ten years' standing and was appointed to assign seats to the Theras.  Vin.ii.305&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ajita.&lt;/b&gt;-A paribbājaka who visited the Buddha, and at whose instigation the Buddha preached to the Bhikkhus on the difference between dhamma and adhamma.  A.v.229ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Ajita.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin, the Bodhisatta in the time of Sobhita Buddha.  J.i.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Ajita.&lt;/b&gt;-General of the Licchavis and follower of the Buddha.  Immediately after his death he was born in Tāvatimsa; he visited the Buddha to refute a statement made about him by the naked ascetic Pātikaputta to the effect that he had been born in the Mahāniraya as a result of having followed the teaching of the Buddha.  D.iii.15-16; DA.iii.825.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajita_maanava,Ajita-mānava')"&gt;5. Ajita-mānava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Ajita&lt;/b&gt;.-Thera (Ap.i.335ff), probably to be identified with Ajita (5), but the story of his past differs completely from that of Ajita-mānava given in the Thag.  Commentary.  In the time of the Buddha Padumuttara he lit a lamp in front of the Enlightened One.  As a result of this he enjoyed happiness in heaven for 60,000 kappas, and when he was born from Tusita in this Buddha-age there was a great light on the day of his birth.  He is stated to have been a disciple of Bāvarī (Ap.i.337, 28), but he heard of the Buddha while in Himavā.  Later he became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Ajita.&lt;/b&gt;-The lay name of Metteya Buddha in his last birth, when he will attain Enlightenment.  Anāgata-Vamsa, pp.  43, 45, 56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Ajita.&lt;/b&gt;-A Pacceka-Buddha who lived ninety-one kappas ago.  Dāsaka Thera, in a previous birth, gave him mangoes to eat (Ajina).  ThagA.i.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Ajita&lt;/b&gt;.-A brahmin, a previous birth of Citapūjaka Thera; he offered flowers to Sikhī Buddha.  Ap.i.243.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ajita Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Preached by the Buddha to Ajita the Paribbājaka on the difference between dhamma and adhamma.  A.v.229ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abbhuta (Dhamma) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbhuta Sutta.-The Buddha preaches the marvellous and the path leading thereto.  S.iv.371.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbhuta Dhamma.-Name given to one of the nine divisions (anga) of the Dhamma (Vin.iii.8; M.i.133; A.ii.103; Pug.43; Mil.344, etc.).  Buddhaghosa (DA.i.24) defines it as including all the passages treating of wonders, e.g.  the four marvellous things described in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta.  D.ii.145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbhuta Dhamma Sutta.- Three Suttas on the marvel that when a Tathāgata preaches the Dhamma, folk give up their usual predispositions and listen to it.  (A.ii.131f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambilapassava&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Ceylon, near Kurunda, the residence of Mahāsiva (Near Mannar, Cv.  trans.  i.66, n.6).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggabodhi I.  built a vihāra there and gave the village for its maintenance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihāra and the village were dedicated to the ascetics of the Theravada fraternity.

This man invited the Buddha, and during seven days gave many gifts to him and to the monks.  On the last day he presented the company of arahants with all necessaries.

The whole Sutta is found in Anguttara (ii.34f.), but the uddāna of the Anguttara calls it Pasāda Sutta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Pasāda Sutta (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Aciravatī.&lt;/b&gt;-A river, the modern Rāpti in Oudh; one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancanadi,Pañca-mahānadī')"&gt;Pañca-mahānadī&lt;/a&gt; (Vin.ii.237), the five great rivers flowing from the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/himava,Himālaya')"&gt;Himālaya&lt;/a&gt; eastwards (pācīnaninnā) (S.v.39, etc.) into the sea.  During the hot season it ran dry, leaving a bed of sand (A.iv.101).  It flowed through &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; an udumbara grove grew on its banks; it, could be seen from the terrace of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi's&lt;/a&gt; palace (Vin.iv.111-12; SnA.i.19).  To the south of it was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/manasaakata,Manasākata')"&gt;Manasākata&lt;/a&gt;, and on its southern bank was a mango grove where the Buddha sometimes resided (D.i.235-6).  The Tevijja Sutta was preached here, and the Aciravatī is used in a simile to prove the futility of sacrifices and prayers: it is of no use standing on one bank of the river and calling to the other bank to come over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the river were many bathing places, in some of which courtesans bathed naked; the Bhikkhunīs did likewise until a rule was passed prohibiting it (Vin.i.293; iv.278).  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/chabbaggiyaa,Chabbaggiya')"&gt;Chabbaggiya&lt;/a&gt; nuns, however, continued to do so even afterwards (Vin.iv.259f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river was crossed in rafts (Vin.iii.63); it sometimes became so full (D.i.244-5; M.iii.117; J.iv.167) that disastrous floods occurred, in one of which &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha,Vidūdabha')"&gt;Vidūdabha&lt;/a&gt; and his army were swept into the sea (DhA.i.360).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sheltered spots monks and brahmins used to bathe (Vin.iv.161), and once &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; himself bathed there (AA.i.315).  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/s5_say,Sattarasa-vaggiya')"&gt;Sattarasa-vaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks frequented the river for water-sports (Vin.iv.111-12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the Buddha was told that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya,Pañcavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks were in the habit of seizing the cows that crossed the river (Vin.i.191).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siivalii,Sivalī')"&gt;Sivalī&lt;/a&gt; stopped on the banks of the Aciravatī while on his way to the Himālaya with five hundred monks (AA.i.139).  In the time of Kassapa Buddha the river flowed round Sāvatthi and, at the eastern fort, flowed into a wide and deep lake on which separate bathing places were made for the king, the people, the Buddha and the Order respectively (MA.i.371).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people on the banks were in the habit of casting nets for fish (UdA.366).  Near the river was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dandakappaka,Dandakappa')"&gt;Dandakappa&lt;/a&gt;, a Kosalan village, and while staying there Ananda bathed in the river with many other monks (A.iii.402).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two occasions are mentioned on which monks hit in the eye swans flying over the river (J.i.418 and ii.366. See also DhA.iv.5 and 8f).  It was here that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patacara,Patācārā')"&gt;Patācārā's&lt;/a&gt; child was drowned (DhA.ii.264).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapila,Kapila')"&gt;Kapila&lt;/a&gt; was born here as a golden fish as a result of his evil deeds (DhA.iv.41; see also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/k3_kay,Kapila S')"&gt;Kapila S&lt;/a&gt;).  In the Avadāna Sataka (DhA.i.63; also ii.60) the name is given as Aciravatī, and according to I Tsing (p.156) means the river of the Aji (dragon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Monks should not accept or use a pond or any such thing, unless it has been properly gifted to them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the real owners of the pond, etc., or their heirs, or, if no heirs exist, the chief of the district, having discovered that the pond was being used by monks, were to give it to the monks, then the gift becomes kappiya, "as in the case of the bucket of water taken by the monk of Cittalapabbata and Alandanāgarājamahesī" - evidently meaning that the water was later given to the monk by the mahesī, thereby making it kappiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahipeta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seen by Moggallāna as he came from Gijjhakūta to Rājagaha in the company of Lakkhana.  He revealed the peta's story in the presence of the Buddha.  In the long past men had erected a bower of leaves and grass on the banks of the river near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; for a Pacceka Buddha.  Here residents from the city would visit him morning and evening with offerings.  On the way they had to pass a field, which in their many journeying they trampled and damaged.  The farmer tried in vain to prevent them.  One day, in exasperation, when the Pacceka Buddha was away, the farmer burnt his bower, destroying everything in it.  When he confessed his guilt the followers of the Pacceka Buddha beat him to death.  He suffered in Avīci till the earth was elevated one league, and was thereafter born a peta, twenty-five leagues in length, his body enveloped in flames.

When the Bulis of Allakappa heard of the Buddha's death, they sent messengers to the Mallas asking for a portion of the relics, claiming that they too, like the Buddha, were khattiyas.  Having obtained them, they later built a thūpa over them (D.ii.166-7; Bv.xxviii.2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allakappa seems to have had a republican form of government, but its importance was not very great.  According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.161), Allakappa was ten leagues in extent and its king was on intimate terms of friendship with the King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vethadiipa,Vethadīpaka')"&gt;Vethadīpaka&lt;/a&gt;.  They spent a great deal of their time together, so that the two countries must have been near each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Allakappa.&lt;/b&gt;-The King of Allakappa and friend of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vethadiipa,Vethadīpaka')"&gt;Vethadīpaka&lt;/a&gt;.  They both renounced their kingdoms and became ascetics in the Himālaya.  At first they lived in the same hermitage, but later separated and lived apart, meeting once a fortnight, on fast-days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vethadīpaka died and was born a mighty king of devas.  Soon after, when visiting Allakappa, he learned that the latter's asceticism was being disturbed by wild elephants.  Vethadīpaka gave him a lute with which to charm them, and spells whereby he might influence them.  The lute had three strings; at the plucking of the first, the elephants ran away at once, of the second they ran away but looked back at each step, but when the third was plucked, the leader of the herd came and offered the player his back on which to sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, Allakappa met the Queen of Parantapa, King of Kosambi, with her son Udena, who had been born in the forest, the queen having been carried thither by a large bird of prey.  Allakappa took them to the hermitage and looked after them, in ignorance of their high estate.  He later lived with the queen as his wife.  One day he perceived, by the occultation of Parantapa's star, that the king was dead; he told this to the queen who then confessed her identity and that of Udena, the legitimate heir to the throne.  Allakappa gave to Udena the magic lute and taught him the spells that by their power he might gain his heritage.

The festival lasted for seven days (Mhv.v.94).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvamsa Tīkā explains it by saying that the king fasted for seven days, standing gazing at the figure with unwinking eyes.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambattha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ambattha.&lt;/b&gt;-(usually called &lt;b&gt;Ambattha-mānava&lt;/b&gt;).  A brahmin youth of the Ambattha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasādi, at Ukkatthā.  He was learned in the three Vedas and the correlated branches of knowledge, including the Lokāyata, as recorded in the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87ff).  Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icchānadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the Sākiyans and calling them menials.  It appears that Ambattha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasādi's to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sākyans, and had been insulted there (D.i.91).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambattha replied that he came of the Kanhāyana-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkāka, named Disā.  The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kanha (devil), hence the family name.  Kanha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarūpī, daughter of Okkāka (D.i.96-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambattha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true.  This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one's caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambattha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man.  Ambattha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview.  Pokkharasādi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambattha and kicks him.  Later Pokkharasādi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for a meal.  At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasādi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkatthā.  Pokkharasādi himself becomes a Sotāpanna (DA.i.278).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not told that Ambattha became a follower of the Buddha.  Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.274) that the Buddha knew that Ambattha would not profit by his discourse in his present life (iminā attabhāvena magga-pātubhāvo natthi), and that therefore a sermon with the idea of converting him would only have meant spending unnecessary time.  Ambattha himself only visited the Buddha on account of his interest in physiognomy.  According to Buddhaghosa the idea of the Buddha in preaching the Ambattha Sutta at such length was that it might be repeated to Pokkharasādi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is conjectured that the Ambattha, who is identified with Kāvinda, one of the counsellors of King Vedeha, in the Ummagga Jātaka (J.vi.478), probably refers to the Ambattha of this sutta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambattha.&lt;/b&gt;-A king of old, at whose court Rāhulamātā in one of her former lives had been a handmaid.

At its lower end was the settlement of the yakkha Cittarāja (Mhv.x.84).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hot weather it ran dry, and on one occasion Devānampiyatissa used its mud for building a temporary structure in which to deposit the relics brought from Jambudīpa (Mhv.xvii.35).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hall which Dutthagāmani built round the Maricavatti Vihāra extended into a part of the Abhaya tank (Mhv.xxvi.20).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Bhātikābhaya water was taken from the tank, by means of machines, up to the top of the Mahā Thūpa, for the sprinkling of the flowers offered there (Mhv.xxxiv.45).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tank is generally identified with the modern Basavakkulam (Geiger, Mhv.  trans.  74, n.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajapala-nigrodha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A banyan tree which is famous in Buddhist literature.  It was in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree, and a week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree.  There he met the Huhunkajātika Brahmin (Vin.i.2-3).  Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana (Vin.i.4).  It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task (Vin.i.5-7; in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, says Buddhaghosa, SA.i.152).  This was immediately after the meal offered by Tapassu and Bhalluka, so says the Majjhima Atthakathā (i.385; J.i.81).  When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher (A.ii.20f.; S.i.138f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Mara tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once (D.ii.112).  Several other conversations held here with Mara are recorded in the Samyutta (S.i.103f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment (D.ii.267), and it was here that Sujata offered him a meal of milk-rice (J.i.16, 69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, in the fifth week after the Enlightenment, Mara's daughters tried to tempt the Buddha (J.i.78, 469).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several etymologies are suggested for the name: (a) in its shadow goatherds (ajapālā) rest; (b) old brahmins, incapable of reciting the Vedas, live here in dwellings protected by walls and ramparts (this derivation being as follows: na japantī ti =ajapā, mantānam anajjhāyakā=ajapā, ālenti arīyanti nivāsam etthāti=Ajapālo ti); (c) it shelters the goats that seek its shade at midday (UdA.51).  The northern Buddhists say that the tree was planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta's six years' penance, to shelter him (Beal, Romantic Legend of Buddha,192, 238; Mtu.iii.302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brahmā Sutta (S.v.167) and the Magga Sutta (S.v.185), both on the four satipatthāna, and another Brahmā Sutta (S.v.232f) on the five indriyāni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment.  On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts.  Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age.  To them he preached the four Thera-karanā dhamma.  A.ii.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alakadeva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera who accompanied Majjhima to Himavā (Sp.i.68).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He converted one of the five districts there and ordained 100,000 monks (Mbv.115).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dīpavamsa (viii.10) gives his name as Mūlakadeva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

But she reviled an arahant Therī by calling her a prostitute, and for this she was born in purgatory.  In the present age she was the daughter of a rich and distinguished citizen of Benares but, because of her former evil speech, became a prostitute in Rājagaha.  Having heard the Buddha preach, she entered the Order of the bhikkhunis.  Wishing to obtain the higher ordination from the Buddha, she set out for Sāvatthi, but was waylaid and stopped by libertines.  So she sent a man to ask the Buddha's advice and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger (Thig.vv.25-6; ThigA.30ff.; Vin.ii.277; Ap.  ii.  610-11).  Her case established a precedent (Sp.i.242).  Later she attained arahantship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (VT.iii.360, n.3; and VT.ii.195-6, n.3) that her name "half Kāsī" might mean that she charged five hundred pieces from her patrons.  For, according to Buddhaghosa, Kāsī means one thousand, and anything worth one thousand is called kāsiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation is, however, given by Dhammapāla (ThigA.32).  The revenue which accrued to the king for one day from Kāsī was a thousand.  Addhakāsī's patrons had to give a like sum to spend a night with her.  This is referred to in one of the verses attributed to her in the Theragāthā (v.25).  For this reason she was called Kāsī.  But later, many men, not being able to afford a thousand, would pay half the amount and spend the day with her.  As a result she became known as Addhakāsī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amarādevī-pañha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name given to the riddle in which Amarā tells Mahosadha the way to her house: "Yena sattu bilangā ca dvigunapalāso ca pupphito, yenādāmi tena vadāmi yena nādāmi na tena vadāmi esa maggo yavamajjhakassa etam channapatham vijānāhīti."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholiast explains it thus: entering the village you will see a cake shop and then a gruel shop; further on an ebony tree in flower, take a path to the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This riddle referred to in J.i.425 as the Amarādevipañha, is, however, called Channapathapañha in the Ummagga Jātaka itself, where it actually occurs in the story.  J.vi.365-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambattha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Icchānankala when Ambattha-mānava visited the Buddha (D.i.87ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference is made to the Commentary on this sutta where a detailed explanation is given of the term cārikā (AA.i.407).  It is regarded, together with the Sonadanda and Kūtadanta Suttas, as one of the chief discussions which the Buddha had with his opponents (MA.ii.697).  The eight kinds of vijjā are detailed therein.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambasakkhara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavi')"&gt;Licchavi&lt;/a&gt; chieftains of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha's&lt;/a&gt; time.  He was a nihilist by persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once while going through the city he saw a beautiful woman.  Wishing to possess her, he commandeered her husband's services and one day ordered him to bring mud and lotuses from a pond three leagues away, his life to be the penalty if he did not return the same evening.  Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than usual.  The woman's husband returned to the city before nightfall, but finding the gates shut, he asked a thief, who was impaled just outside, to bear witness to his having arrived before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thief's uncle had been a pious merchant in Vesāli, but had been beheaded for alleged implication in his nephew's theft.  He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he possessed various powers.  By reason, however, of having once hidden, in jest, the clothes of a friend who was bathing in the river, he was born naked.  Every night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man with the lotuses asked the thief's assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta's arrival that night and to get his counsel.  This the man did, and when, the next day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his defence.  Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he saw the peta and learnt all that had happened.  Greatly marvelling, he offered to help the peta in getting rid of his nudity.  He was asked to seek the holy Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kappitaka_th,Kappitaka')"&gt;Kappitaka&lt;/a&gt; who lived in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kapinacanaa,Kapinaccanā')"&gt;Kapinaccanā&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajji')"&gt;Vajji&lt;/a&gt; country and give him robes in the peta's name.  This was done, and the peta immediately appeared before them clad in heavenly robes.  From that time Ambasakkhara was converted to the Faith, and after having listened to a sermon by Kappitaka became a Sotāpanna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impaled thief was set free and was cured by the royal physician; he later attained to the state of an arahant.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adhammavādi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk who lived soon after the death of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapa,Kassapa')"&gt;Kassapa&lt;/a&gt; Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been guilty of various offences, he was charged by his colleague &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammavaadi,Dhammavādi')"&gt;Dhammavādi&lt;/a&gt;; he persuaded certain vinayadhara monks to give an ex parte judgment in his favour (SnA.i.195-7).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two monks who were chiefly responsible for this judgment were later known as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata,Hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira,Sātāgira')"&gt;Sātāgira&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Addhamāsaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King.  He was a poor man of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  He saved a halfpenny (addha-māsaka) and hid it in a brick wall.  When the festival came round, wishing to take part in the fun with his wife, who had also saved a halfpenny, he travelled six leagues in the hot sun to fetch his savings from the hiding-place.  King Udaya saw him as he passed by the palace singing, and having discovered his mission, gave him half of his kingdom.  The man chose the half in which his halfpenny lay concealed.  He later became an ascetic.  His story is given in the Gangamāla Jātaka (J.iii.449 ff.; iv.174).  He was Ananda in the present age.  J.iii.454.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambattha-vijjā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charm learnt by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanha,Kanha')"&gt;Kanha&lt;/a&gt;, ancestor of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kanhayaana,Kanhāyanas')"&gt;Kanhāyanas&lt;/a&gt;, from the ascetics of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dakkhinaapatha,Dakhinajanapada')"&gt;Dakhinajanapada&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charm had the power of disarming those who tried to attack its possessor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the aid of this charm Kanha won &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/m1_mag,Maddarūpī')"&gt;Maddarūpī&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/o/okkaaka,Okkāka')"&gt;Okkāka&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alambusa Jātaka (No.  523)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isisinga, son of the Bodhisatta and of a doe, who had drunk water into which the Bodhisatta's semen had fallen, lived the ascetic life like his father.  He had been warned by his father about the wiles of women, and lived in the forest practising the most severe austerities.  By virtue of the power of these austerities, Sakka's abode trembled, and Sakka, fearing his rivalry, sent down a beautiful celestial nymph, Alambusā, to tempt him and despoil him of his virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This she succeeded in doing, and for three years he lay unconscious in her embrace.  At last, realising what had happened, he forthwith forsook sensual desire, and developing mystic meditation, attained to jhāna.  Alambusā pleaded for forgiveness, which was readily granted.  The story was related in reference to the temptation of a monk by the wife he had had during his lay life (J.v.152-61. See also the Nalinikā J.  (v.193f.) where Isisinga is tempted by Nalinikā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Digha Nikāya Commentary (ii.370; see also Sp.i.214. Cp.  the story of Rsyasrnga in the Ramayana i.9. The story is found in the Bharhut Tope, see Cunningham, CSB.29, P1.15) the name of the ascetic is given as Migasingi, and the story is quoted as an instance of a wrong explanation of the cessation of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambapālī (Ambapālikā)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A courtesan of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is said to have come spontaneously into being at Vesāli in the gardens of the king.  The gardener found her at the foot of a mango tree - hence her name - and brought her to the city.  She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand.  Finally, in order to end their strife, they appointed her courtesan.  Later she became a devout follower of the Buddha, and building a vihāra in her own garden, gave it to him and the Order.  This was during the Buddha's last visit to Vesāli shortly before his death.  It is said that when Ambapālī heard of the Buddha's visit to Kotigāma near Vesāli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day.  The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/licchavi,Licchavis')"&gt;Licchavis&lt;/a&gt; of Vesāli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha.  She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world.  The DA.  says that just before Ambapālī's visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her (DA.ii.545).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was after this meal that Ambapālī gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order.  The Buddha accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva.  Vin.i.231-3; D.ii.95-8; the two accounts vary in details, e.g.  in the Digha version the Buddha was already in Ambapālivana, and not in Kotigāma, when the courtesan visited him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambapālī had a son, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vimalakondanna_thera,Vimala-Kondañña')"&gt;Vimala-Kondañña&lt;/a&gt;, who was an eminent Elder.  Having heard him preach one day, she renounced the world and, working for insight by studying the law of impermanence as illustrated in her own ageing body, she attained arahantship (ThigA.206-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen verses ascribed to her are found in the Therīgāthā (252-70).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sikhii,Sikhī Buddha')"&gt;Sikhī Buddha&lt;/a&gt; she had entered the Order.  While yet a novice, she took part in a procession of Bhikkhunīs, and was doing homage at a shrine when an arahant Therī in front of her hastily spat in the court of the shrine.  Seeing the spittle and not knowing who had committed the fault, she said in reproof, "What prostitute has been spitting here?" It was owing to this remark that she was born as a courtesan in her last birth (ThigA.206-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna (quoted also in ThigA) gives some more details about her.  She had been a daughter of a Khattiya family in the time of Phussa Buddha and had done many good deeds in order to be beautiful in later births.  As a result of the abuse of the nun (referred to above) she had been born in hell and later had, for ten thousand lives, been a courtesan.  In Kassapa Buddha's time she had practised celibacy (Ap.ii.613ff.  ; ThigA.213f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that she charged fifty kahāpanas a night from her patrons and that Vesāli became very prosperous through her.  It was this that prompted Bimbisāra to get a courtesan for his own city of Rājagaha (Vin.i.268).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Ambapālī's patrons was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt;, and he was the father of her son Vimala-Kondañña (ThagA.i.146).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Theragāthā (vv.1020-21; ThagA.ii.129) there are two verses which, according to tradition, were spoken by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt; in admonition of monks who lost their heads at the sight of Ambapālī.  Whether this was before or after she joined the Order we are not told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

A monk, who is inconsiderately noisy, is the cause of the story being told (J.i.435-6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.142f) the name of the story is given as Akālarāvikukkuta-Jātaka, and is related of the Thera Padhānikatissa, who is stated to have been the cock of the Jātaka story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

When he returned from a certain Yakkha-assembly he found the Buddha seated on his couch, as had already been told to him in the assembly by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/satagira,Satāgira')"&gt;Satāgira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hemavata,Hemavata')"&gt;Hemavata&lt;/a&gt;.  In anger he tried in various ways to cast out the Buddha, but failed in his efforts and ended by becoming his disciple (UdA.63ff.  For a note on this passage see J.P.T.S.  1886, 94ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two explanations are given of his name: aje kalāpetvā bandhanena ajakotthāsena saddhim balim paticchati, no aññathā .  .  .  kecipana ajake viya satte lāpetīti, Ajaka-lāpako ti (UdA.64 ) (those bringing him sacrifices bleat like goats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ajakalāpaka-cetiya&lt;/b&gt;.-A shrine at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pava,Pāvā')"&gt;Pāvā&lt;/a&gt; at which sacrifices were offered to Ajakalāpaka (Ud.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

In his youth he first joined the Order of the Niganthas; being dissatisfied, he was won over by the Buddha's Twin-miracle and, entering the Order, reached arahantship (Thag.v.88; ThagA.i.186).  He is evidently to be identified with Sālapupphadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (i.169).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Vipassī Buddha's time he was born as a lion and gave the Buddha a flowering branch of a sala-tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also once a cakkavattī, named Verocana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.

In the Sarabhanga Jātaka he is mentioned as having sinned against Angīrasa (J.v.135; also DA.i.266).  He is identified with Arjuna, called Kārtavīraya of the Kathāsaritsāgara (ii.639), and in the Uttarakanda of the Rāmāyana (Sarga 32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used to offer sacrifices to the gods (J.vi.201).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Ajjuna.-The eldest of the five sons of King Pandu, all of whom were married to Kanhā.  On discovering her liason with a hunchbacked slave and her treachery towards themselves, they gave her up and retired to Himavā (J.v.425f).  Ajjuna was previous birth of the bird-king Kunāla (J.v.427).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhisammataka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yakkha chieftain.  Upavāna Thera, who at the time of Padumuttara Buddha had been a very poor man, set up his uttarāsanga as a banner on the shrine erected over the relics of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhisammataka had been appointed by the devas as guardian of the offerings at the shrine, and he went round the shrine three times carrying the banner, while he himself remained invisible.

On one occasion when the Buddha asks Mahā Kassapa to preach to the monks, the latter reports that it is impossible to talk to them because monks like Bhanda, colleague of Ananda, and Abhiñjika, were engaged in wordy warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha sends for them and admonishes them.  Having heard his discourse, they express regret for their behaviour and promise to cultivate self-restraint in the future (Abhijika, Ābhiñjika).  S.ii.204-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Aggabodhi VI.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon (A.D.  727-66), son of Kassapa, brother of Mahinda I., and, at one time, ruler of Pācīnadesa (Cv.xlviii.32).  He became king under the name Silāmegha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggālava Cetiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief shrine at Ālavī (SnA.i.344; SA.i.207) (hence probably the name), originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist vihāra.  The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g.  against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224).  The Vangīsa Sutta was preached there to Vangīsa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa (Sn.59f).  In the early years of Vangīsa's novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor's solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibhāna) (S.i.187).  Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Alavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (sangahavatthūni) learnt from the Buddha (A.iv.216-20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the evenings (J.i.160).  It was here that the Manikantha Jātaka was related (J.ii.282), also the Brahmadatta Jātaka (J.iii.78), and the Atthisena Jātaka (J.iii.351), all in connection with the rules for building cells.  See also Ālavī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajatasattu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Son of Bimbisāra, King of Magadha, and therefore half-brother to Abhayarājakumara.  He succeeded his father to the throne.  His mother was a daughter of Mahākosala (J.iii.121), and he married Vajirā, Pasenadi's daughter (J.iv.343), by whom be had a son Udāyibhadda (D.i.50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajatasattu grew up to be a noble and handsome youth.  Devadatta was, at this time, looking for ways and means of taking revenge on the Buddha, and seeing in the prince a very desirable weapon, he exerted all his strength to win him to his side.  Ajatasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta's powers of iddhi and became his devoted follower (Vin.ii.185; J.i.185-6).  He built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans (S.ii.242).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary.  When Bimbisāra learnt of the prince's intentions he abdicated in his favour.  But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbisāra, who was one of the Buddha's foremost supporters, was killed.  (DA.i.135-7).  According to the Sankicca Jātaka (J.v.262ff.) he had killed his father in previous births too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajātasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter's attempts to kill the Buddha (See Devadatta).  In the Sanjiva Jātaka (J.  i.  &lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="510 f"&gt;510 f&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.) we are told that in past lives he had associated with the sinful and once lost his life as a result.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself (D.i.85); but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the persuasions of his physician Jīvaka Komārabhacca.  And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jivaka's Mango grove at Rājagaha (D.i.49-50; J.v.262-9. An illustration of this visit is the subject of one of the bas-reliefs on the Barhut Tope; Cunningham, Pl.  xvi., fig.36, and p.135).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached.  The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings.  It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king's impiety.  Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly.  But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king's misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth (Sotāpattimagga, says the Commentary) would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon.  (D.i.85-6).  It is said that from the day of his father's death he could not sleep on account of terrifying dreams, particularly after he had heard of Devadatta's dire fate (J.i.508).  He slept after his visit to the Buddha (DA.i.238).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha's faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters.  (But see DA.i.238, where we are told "tinnam ratanānam mahāsakkāram akāsi").  He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Mandikāputta having spoken rather impolitely to the Buddha, he at once flew into a rage (A.ii.182).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakka said of him that among the puthujjanas he was most possessed of piety (DA.ii.610).  When the Buddha died, in the eighth year of Ajātasattu reign (Mhv.ii.32), the latter's ministers decided not to tell him the news at once, in case he should die of a broken heart.  On the pretext of warding off the evil effects of a dream, they placed him in a vat filled with the four kinds of sweet (catumadhura) and broke the sad news gently to him.  He immediately fainted, and it was not till they put him in two other vats and repeated the tidings that he realised their implication (DA.ii.605-6).  He forthwith gave himself up to great lamentation and despair, "like a madman," calling to mind the Buddha's various virtues and visiting various places associated in his mind with the Buddha.  Later he sent messengers to claim his share of the Buddha's relics, and when he obtained them he prolonged the rites held in their honour till the arahants had to seek Sakka's aid to make the king take the relics away to Rājagaha, where he erected over them a stone thupa (DA.ii.610).  Two months afterwards, when the first Council was held, he gave the undertaking his royal patronage and assisted the monks who took part in it with all his power (Sp.i.10-11; DA.i.8-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several incidents connected with Ajātasattu's reign are mentioned in the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue of a Kāsī village had been given to her by her father, Mahākosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisāra's murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it.  Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle.  Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms.  Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy.  This Pasenadi gave to Ananda (M.ii.116).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army.  On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money (S.i.82-5; J.ii.403-4; Avas.  54-7; J.iv.343f.; DhA.iii.259.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajātasattu evidently took his reverses very unsportingly.  (See the Haritamāta Jātaka, J.ii.237f.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi's minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Vidūdabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu's help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial (See Pasenadi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year before the Buddha's death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory.  The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible (D.ii.72f).  The Samyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu's chance.  (S.ii.268).  According to the Jainas, Ajātasattu fought with Cedaga, king of Vesāli, for the possession of an extraordinary elephant (Hoernle on Ājivaka in ERE i.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chance came about three years later, for by the treachery of Vassakāra, he succeeded in sowing dissension among the leading families of Vesāli.  Having thus weakened them, he swooped down upon the place with an overwhelming force and completely destroyed it (For details see Licchavi).  Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting (M.iii.7; MA.ii.853; see also Buddhist India, p.13).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the end of Ajātasattu's reign the books mention very little except that he was killed by his son Udaya or Udāyībhadda (Mhv.iv.l), who had been born on the day that Bimbisāra died as a result of his tortures (DA.i.137).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are told that Ajātasattu had feared that his son might kill him and had therefore secretly hoped that Udaya would become a monk (DA.i.153).  Ajātasattu's reign lasted thirty-two years (Mhv.ii.31; but see Geiger's Introd.  to Mhv.  trans.  xi ff.; also Samaddar: Glories of Magadha, 17, n.  3; also Vincent Smith: Early History of India, pp.  &lt;st2:frenchfranctoeuro ProductID="26 ff"&gt;26 ff&lt;/st2:frenchfranctoeuro&gt;.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was he who built the fortress of Pālātiputta, which later became the capital of Magadha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not know what Ajātasattu's real name was.  By the Jains he is called Kunika or Konika, which again is probably a nickname (Dial.  ii.79, n.1).  The title Vedehiputta which always accompanies his name probably means "son of the Videha lady." At the time of Buddhaghosa there seems to have been much confusion about the meaning of this word.  According to Buddhaghosa (DA.i.139) Vedehi means "wise." There seems to have been another explanation which Buddhaghosa rejects - that Ajātasattu was the son of the Videha queen.  Videhi was probably the maiden, family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother.  According to a Tibetan authority her personal name was Vāsavī, and she was called Videhi because she was from Videha (Rockhill, p.  63. In the Pali books he is often referred to as Kosaladevī).  (See also Vedehikā.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two explanations are given of the epithet Ajātasattu.  According to Buddhaghosa he was so called because the soothsayers predicted his enmity to his father even before his birth, and a story is told of how his mother, at the time of his conception, had a longing to drink blood from Bimbisāra's right hand.  The longing was satisfied, but when the queen heard the soothsayer's prediction, she tried, in many ways, to bring about a miscarriage.  (DA.i.133ff.; J.iii.121-2) The park where she tried to bring about the miscarriage was called Maddakucchi (SA.i.61).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this she was prevented by the king.  Later both parents grew to be very fond of him.  There is a story of the prince, holding his father's finger, visiting Jotika's marvellous palace and thinking that his father was a fool for not taking Jotika's wealth.  When he became king he acquired Jotika's palace.  (DhA.iv.211 and 222f).  As a boy he used to visit the Buddha with his father (DA.i.152).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To show Bimbisāra's love for the babe, an incident is mentioned of how once, when the prince was yelling with pain because of a boil on his finger, the nurses took him to the king who was then holding court.  To soothe the child, the king put the offending finger in his mouth, where the boil burst.  Unable to spit the pus out the king swallowed it (DA.i.138).  The other explanation is that also found in the Upanisads, (Dial.ii.78f ) and this is probably the correct one.  It says that the word means "he against whom there has arisen no foe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Digha Commentary, (i.237-8) Ajātasattu was born in the Lohakumbhiya niraya after his death.  He will suffer there for 60,000 years, and later will reach nibbana as a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa (Vijitāvī).  Ajātasattu's crime of parricide is often given as an example of an upacchedaka-kamma which has the power of destroying the effect of meritorious deeds (E.g., AA.i.369).  He is also mentioned as the worst kind of parricide (E.g.  AA.i.335).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajātasattu seems to have been held in hatred by the Niganthas.  The reason is probably that given in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.66f), where it is said that when Moggallāna had been killed by thieves, spies were sent out by the king to discover the murderers.  When arrested, the murderers confessed that they had been incited by the Niganthas.  The king thereupon buried five hundred Niganthas waist-deep in pits dug in the palace court and had their heads ploughed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Akitti (v.l.  Akatti)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta in one of his births.  He was a brahmin magnate of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, who, after giving away all his wealth in charity, retired to the forest with his sister, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasavatii,Yasavatī')"&gt;Yasavatī&lt;/a&gt;.  When gifts were brought to him as homage to his holiness, he sought obscurity, and, leaving his sister, dwelt in Kāradīpa, then known as Ahidīpa, eating the leaves of a Kāra-tree sprinkled with water.  By virtue of his asceticism Sakka's throne was heated, and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; (Anuruddha in a previous birth), having tested him, and being satisfied that worldly attainments were not his aim, granted him various boons, including one that Sakka should not visit him any more and disturb his asceticism! (J.iv.236f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story is given in the Cariyāpitaka (p.1), to illustrate dāna-paramitā.  In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi_jat_541,Nimi Jātaka')"&gt;Nimi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; he is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (*), who, by their holy lives; passed the Peta world to be born in Brahma's heaven.  In the Jātaka-mālā (no.7) his name occurs as Agastya, but he should not be confused with the Vedic sage of that name (See Vedic Index).  Perhaps he belonged to the Kassapagotta, because, in the conversation related in the Jātaka story, Sakka addresses him as "Kassapa." (J.iv.240-1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*) J.vi.99, the others being the seven brothers Yāmahanu, Somayāga, Manojava, Samudda, Māgha, Bharata and Kālikarakkhiya; and Angīrasa, Kassapa and Kisavaccha.

The Buddha, while on his rounds, sees him tending the fire and preparing oblations, and stands for alms in front of his house.  The brahmin abuses him, calling him mundaka and vasala.  Thereupon the Buddha preaches to him the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vasala_sutta,Vasala Sutta')"&gt;Vasala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (or, as it is sometimes called.  the Aggika Bhāradvāja Sutta), and wins him over to the faith (Sn.21-5).  The sobriquet Aggika was given to him because he was a tender of the sacred fire.  SnA.i.174f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Aggika-Bhāradvāja.&lt;/b&gt;-A brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, evidently different from the above, also a fire-tender.  He prepares a meal for sacrifice, and when the Buddha, out of compassion for him, appears before his house for alms, he says the meal is meant only for one who has the "threefold lore" (the three Vedas).  The Buddha gives the brahmin another interpretation of the "threefold lore"; (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aggika_sutta,Aggika Sutta')"&gt;Aggika Sutta&lt;/a&gt;).  The brahmin, thereupon, becomes a convert, enters the Order, and, in due course, attains arahantship.  S.i.166f.; SA.i.179.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Aggika-Bhāradvāja&lt;/b&gt;.-The name assumed by the jackal in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/aggika_jat_129,Aggika Jātaka')"&gt;Aggika Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambātakavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grove at Macchikāsanda, belonging to Cittagahapati.  Being pleased with the Elder Mahānāma of Macchikāsanda, Citta invited him to a meal, and after listening to his discourse, gave the grove to the Order.  At the dedication of the gift the earth trembled.  Later he built a splendid monastery there, the Ambātakārāma, for the use of monks from all parts (AA.i.209; DhA.ii.74).  It became the residence of large numbers of monks, and discussions often took place there between Cittagahapati and the resident bhikkhus (S.iv.281-97).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among eminent Elders who visited the place were &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta of Avanti (who answered Citta's questions regarding the reason for the existence of various views in the world) (S.iv.283-8), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahaka (who, by his magic powers, produced rain and thunderstorms and later showed a special miracle to Citta) (S.iv.288-91), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kāmabhū (who discoursed to Citta on various topics) (S.iv.291-5), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Godatta (S.iv.295-7).  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder Lakuntaka Bhaddiya also lived there, in solitude, wrapt in meditation (Thag.v.466).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind Ambataka was Migapathaka, which was Citta's tributary village (SA.iii.93) (v.l.  Ambālavana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abbhasa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven kappas ago there were thirty-five kings of the name of Abbhasa, all former births of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nita_th,Nita Thera')"&gt;Nita Thera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ThagA.i.182) (v.l.  Ambaramsa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggi-Bhagava&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deity (probably identical with the Vedic Agni), worship of whom brought, as reward, birth in the Brahma-world.  On the day a son is born, a fire (jātaggi) is kindled; when the son comes of age and wishes to renounce household life, this fire is taken to the forest and homage is paid to Aggi-Bhagavā (J.i.285).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nanguttha_jat_144,Nanguttha Jātaka')"&gt;Nanguttha Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.i.494-5) the Bodhisatta, having received an ox as a gift, wishes to offer the flesh to Aggi-Bhagavā, but thinking that the deity will not relish a salt less meal, he goes away in search of salt.  He returns to find that the ox has been eaten by hunters, only the tail, one leg and the skin being left.  "If thou, Aggi-Bhagavā, hast not the power to look after thine own, how canst thou guard me?" So saying, he quenches the fire with water and becomes an anchorite.  In the verses of this context Aggi is addressed as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/j,Jātaveda')"&gt;Jātaveda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/santhava_jat_162,Santhava Jātaka')"&gt;Santhava Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.43-5), too, the Bodhisatta is a votary of the deity.  Once when he makes an offering of milk mixed with ghee the flames blaze forth and burn his hut, and thereupon he loses faith.  In this story Aggi-Bhagavā seems to be identified with Mahā Brahmā.  See also KS.i.209, n.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the exegesis to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhuridatta_jat_543,Bhuridatta Jātaka')"&gt;Bhuridatta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.202), the deity is spoken of as Aggideva, and mention is made of an enquiry made of learned brahmins by a king, Mujalinda, as to the way to heaven.  In answer he is told that Aggideva is the brāhmanadevatā par excellence, and that he should be offered fresh ghee.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambadāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Arahant.  He had been a monkey in the time of Anomadassī Buddha and, having seen the Buddha in Himavā, offered him a mango fruit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this he enjoyed happiness in deva worlds for fifty-seven kappas and was fourteen times king under the name of Ambatthaja.  Ap.i.116-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accima&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King.  One of the descendants of Mahāsammata (Dpv.iii.8; Mtu.ii.5ff.; see also Mtu.i.348. MT.  126).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had twenty-eight sons and grandsons, of immeasurably long life, who reigned in Kusāvatī, Rājagaha and Mithilā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Akkhakkhāyika&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A famine in the mountain-region of Kotta in Ceylon, during the reign of Dutthagāmini.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king sold his earrings and procured a meal for five khīnāsava theras (Mhv.xxxii.29-30).  The famine was so called because nuts called akkha (Terminalia Bellerica) were eaten, which at other times were used as dice.  In the Atthakathā, quoted by the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.593), the famine is called Pāsānachātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amittatāpanā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young wife of the brahmin&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/juujaka,Jūjaka')"&gt;Jūjaka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaalinga,Kālinga')"&gt;Kālinga&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had been given away by her parents in payment of a debt.  Being mocked at by the friends she met at the watering-place, she insisted on being provided with servants.  It was in order to meet with her wishes that Jūjuka went to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vessantara,Vessantara')"&gt;Vessantara&lt;/a&gt; to beg for the latter's children to be used as slaves (J.vi.521-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present Buddha-age, Amittatāpanā was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cincaa_maanavikaa,Ciñcamānavikā')"&gt;Ciñcamānavikā&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayanagara&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhaya,Abhaya (5)')"&gt;Abhaya (5)&lt;/a&gt;, King of Ceylon, when the island was known as Ojadīpa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lay to the east of the Kadamba river (Mhv.xv.58-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhisanda Sutta &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Abhisanda Sutta (3).-Unvarying loyalty to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, to the Sangha and possession of virtues dear to the Ariyan - these are the four floods of merit that bring happiness.  S.v.391-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Abhisanda or Sayhaka Sutta (3).-Same as above; the measure of merit that accrues as a result of these four floods is incalculable, like the waters of the ocean (S.v.399-402).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second and third suttas of both these groups the fourth quality is given in (a) as possession of a heart free from stinginess, delighting in self-surrender; in (b) as possession of insight into the rise and fall of things, insight that is Ariyan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Abhisanda Sutta.-The five yields of merit (puññabhisandā) which accrue to a monk because of concentration of mind in various activities.  A.iii.51f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Abhisanda Sutta.-The eight yields of merit that a monk can obtain by practising various qualities.  A.iv.245f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alambusā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nymph sent by Sakka to tempt the sage &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/i_,Isisinga')"&gt;Isisinga&lt;/a&gt;, as related in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/alambusa_jat_523,Alambusā Jātaka')"&gt;Alambusā Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present age she was the wife of the monk with reference to whom the Alambusā Jātaka was related (J.v.152-61).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her name appears in the Vimānavatthu (p.16, v.10. See also CSB.29, Pl.15) in a list of nymphs who minister with song and dance to Sakka and his queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alīnasattu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta, born as son of Jayaddisa (q.v.), King of Uttarapañcāla in Kampilla.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the boy grew up, fully instructed in all the arts, his father made him Viceroy.  Later, Jayaddisa's life having become forfeit to the man-eating ogre (porisāda), Alīnasattu volunteered to offer himself in his father's place.  The ogre, impressed by the prince's fearlessness and by the readiness with which he carried out his offer, refused to eat him and absolved him from his undertaking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alīnasattu preached to him the five moral laws and, having discovered that the ogre was really a human being, offered him the throne, which, however, the latter would not accept (J.v.22ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lists of births in which the Bodhisatta is mentioned as having practised sīlapāramitā, the Alīnasattu Jātaka is mentioned (E.g., J.i.45) (Adīnasattu, Alīnasatta, Ālīnasatta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhibhūta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera.  He was born in the Rājā's family in Vettha (v.l.  Vetthipura) and succeeded to his father's estate.  When the Buddha came to the city during a tour, Abhibhūta heard him and invited him for a meal; he later entered the Order and became an arahant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three verses ascribed to Abhibhūta occur in the Theragāthā, uttered, it is said, when his kinsmen and retainers came to him lamenting that he had left them without a leader (Thag.vv.255-7; ThagA.i.372f).  The second of these verses is elsewhere (S.i.156) attributed to Abhibhū, chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha.  But in the Milindapañha (245), Nāgasena ascribes the second verse to the Buddha, and in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.121) the third verse also is ascribed to him.  The second verse is also assigned to the Buddha in the Divyāvadāna (p.200), but elsewhere in the same books (p.569) it is said to have been uttered by devas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a former birth Abhibhūta had been a householder in the time of Vessabhū Buddha and became a believer in the Faith, to which he was led by his friends.  When the Buddha died, the populace gathered together to obtain relics, but Abhibhūta, having quenched the pyre with fragrant water, was first able to take those which he desired (ThagA.i.372).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be identified with Citakanibbāpaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.408).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landowner of Mithilā, described also as Videha and Videhiputta, an inhabitant of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videha')"&gt;Videha&lt;/a&gt; country (J.v.166, 167).  While journeying on business, in a carriage, attended by five hundred wagons, he saw the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga,Nāga')"&gt;Nāga&lt;/a&gt; king,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankhapala,Sankhapāla')"&gt;Sankhapāla&lt;/a&gt;, being ill-treated by lewd men who had captured him and, feeling sorry for the Nāga, Alāra gave gifts to the men and their wives and thus obtained his release.  Sankhapāla, thereupon, invited Alāra to the Nāga kingdom where, for a whole year, Alāra lived in all splendour.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, realising that the Nāga's wonderful possessions were the fruit of good deeds done in the past, he became an ascetic in Himavā and afterwards took up his abode in the king's park in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.  The king, seeing him on his begging-rounds, was pleased with his deportment and invited him to the palace.  There, at the king's request, he told him the story of his encounter with Sankhapāla and his subsequent life and exhorted the king to do acts of piety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he was born in the Brahma-world.  See the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sankhapala_jat_521,Sankhapala Jātaka')"&gt;Sankhapala Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  (v.161ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alāra was a previous birth of Sāriputta (Ibid., 177).  (Ālāra.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahogangā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mountain in North India, on the Upper Ganges.  There, for some time, lived the Thera &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sambhuta,Sambhūta Sānavāsi')"&gt;Sambhūta Sānavāsi&lt;/a&gt;, and it was there that &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa Kākandakaputta')"&gt;Yasa Kākandakaputta&lt;/a&gt; saw him.  The meeting of arahants to discuss what measures should be taken against the Vesālī monks was also held there, and at the meeting were present monks from the Western country and from Avanti-Dakkhināpatha (Vin.ii.298-9).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th,Moggaliputta')"&gt;Moggaliputta&lt;/a&gt; lived in Ahogangā all alone for seven years, prior to the Third Council for which he was awaiting the right time (Mhv.v.233; see also Vin.  Texts, ii.146, n.1. The Mbv., p.106, says upari Gangāya; see also Sp.i.57).  The Mahāvamsa describes it as being "further up the Ganges" (uddham Gangāya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/moggaliputta_tissa_th,Moggaliputta Tissa')"&gt;Moggaliputta Tissa&lt;/a&gt; came from Ahogangā to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaliputta')"&gt;Pātaliputta&lt;/a&gt; on a raft.  Sp.i.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggivacchagotta Sutta (Aggivaccha Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana to the wanderer Vacchagotta on the danger and futility of theorising about the world, life, etc.  (M.i.483ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is evidently so called because the simile of a fire is used.  A blazing fire is visible, but, once extinguished, none can say whither it has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhisambodhialankāra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pāli poem in one hundred stanzas written by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saranankara,Saranankara Sangharāja')"&gt;Saranankara Sangharāja&lt;/a&gt; of Ceylon in the eighteenth century.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It treats of the life of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; from the time of his birth as &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumedha,Sumedha')"&gt;Sumedha&lt;/a&gt;, during the regime of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/diipankara,Dīpankara')"&gt;Dīpankara&lt;/a&gt;, to his last birth as Siddhattha.

Aggi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A number of monks go to the Paribbājakārāma at Sāvatthi, and have a courteous discussion with the Paribbājakas, who claim that their teaching is the same as the Buddha's.  The monks are unable to refute their claim and seek the Buddha's advice.  He tells them that the bojjhangas form the distinctive feature of the Dhamma and that the Paribbājakas, if questioned about them, would not be able to answer.  S.v.112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Aggi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-On the seven kinds of fires.  A.iv.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alagaddūpama Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Jetavana to Arittha concerning his heresy.  Arittha held that according to the Doctrine, as he understood it, the states of mind, e.g.  pleasures of sense, declared by the Buddha to be stumbling-blocks, are not such at all to the man who indulges in them.  The Buddha questioned Arittha regarding this, and when Arittha acknowledged that such was his view, the Buddha rebuked him as having not even a spark of illumination regarding the Dhamma and the Vinaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foolish persons, who have learned the Doctrine by heart but fail to study its import, quite miss the real meaning of their memorising and find no joy in it, using it solely as a means of stricture on others or of bandying verbal quotations; they are like a man who, finding a serpent, seizes it by its tail or coils and gets bitten, meeting thereby death or deadly hurt.  But those, who comprehend all that the Doctrine embodies, resemble a man who pins a serpent securely down with a forked stick and grasps it firmly by its neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sutta also contains the parable of the raft.  The Doctrine is like a raft to be used in crossing the flood and then to be abandoned.  Even good things must eventually be discarded, therefore, how much more bad things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last part of the sutta contains questions, chiefly on the mastery of self, asked by various monks, which the Buddha proceeds to explain (M.i.130ff.; MA.i.321ff).  The sutta is quoted by Buddhaghosa (MA.i.136) as an example of a discourse of which the meaning is illustrated by a variety of similes (atthena upamam parivāretvā).  (v.l.  Alagadda Sutta.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Therī.  She belonged to a family in Ujjeni and was the playmate of Abhayamātā (Padumavatī).  When the latter joined the Order, Abhayā, too, left the world.  As she was meditating in Sītavana, the Buddha sent forth a ray of glory to encourage and help her; she thereupon became an arahant (ThigA.33-4).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two verses are attributed to her in the Therīgāthā (35, 46).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sikhī Buddha she was born in a noble family and became the chief queen of the Buddha's father, Arunavā.  One day she offered to the Buddha some lotuses which the king had given her.  As a result, in later births her body was the colour of the lotus and bore the perfume of the lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy times she reigned as queen of heaven and she was chief queen of sixty-three cakkavattis (ThigA.  loc.  cit.).  She is evidently to be identified with Sattuppalamālikā of the Apadāna (ii.517-18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

It consists of seven books: the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhammasanganī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibhanga, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathāvatthu, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puggalapaññatī, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhātukathā, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamaka and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patthāna, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;all designated by the name of Pakarana.  Only in the Chronicles and the Commentaries is the word used as the title of a third Pitaka (See the discussion of this in DA.i.15, 18f).  In the Canon itself (E.g., Vin.i.64; iii.144; iv.344) the word means "special dhamma," i.e.  the Doctrine pure and simple (without admixture of literary treatment or personalities, etc.), and is sometimes coupled with the word abhivinaya (E.g., D.iii.267; M.i.272).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested (New Pāli Dict.  s.v.) that, as the word abhidhamma standing alone is not found either in the Sutta Nipāta, the Samyutta, or the Anguttara, and only once or twice in the Digha and Majjhima, it probably came into use only towards the end of the period in which the four great Nikāyas grew up (See Dial.iii.199 on a possible origin of the Adhidhamma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāsanghikas refused to include the Abhidhamma in the Pitakas at all, as they did not regard it as the word of the Buddha.  (Dpv.v.32-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dighabhānakas the Abhidhamma Pitaka also included the whole of the Khuddaka Nikāya except the Cariyāpitaka, Apadāna and Buddhavamsa (DA.i.15).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to another division, the five Nikāyas are not divisions of the Dhamma but of the whole Canon, and in the fifth are included both the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma (DA.i.28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a legend recorded by Buddhaghosa that the Abhidhamma was first preached by the Buddha in Tāvatimsa at the foot of the Pāricchataka tree, when he was seated on Sakka's throne, during his visit to his mother in Tāvatimsa.  Later it was taught by him to Sāriputta on the banks of the Anotatta Lake, whither Sāriputta had gone to minister to the Buddha during the latter's visit to Tāvatimsa (VibhA.  p.1; AA.i.71, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legend further relates that after the Enlightenment the Buddha spent the fourth week in the Ratanaghara, revolving in his mind the intricate doctrines of the Abhidhamma in all their details (J.i.78).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cullavagga version of the Councils (Chaps.  xi.  and xii; but see DA.i.15 contra) the Abhidhamma Pitaka was not rehearsed at either Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Abhidhamma is not mentioned in the suttas and that only Dhamma and Vinaya are usually referred to, only proves that at one time the Abhidhamma did not form a separate Pitaka.  As a matter of fact, it is not held even by the commentators to be the word of the Buddha in the same sense as the suttas.  One section of it, the Kathāvatthu (but see Kathāvatthu), was taught only at the Third Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as we know, the seven books of the Abhidhamma are peculiar to the Theravādins, though there is evidence that other schools, chiefly the Vaibhāsikas (Sarvāstivādins) and the Sautrāntikas, held the Abhidhamma books sacred.  See Tārānātha: Geschichte des Buddhismus (56) 156 (296).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as the contents of the Abhidhamma are concerned, they do not form a systematic philosophy, but are a special treatment of the Dhamma as found in the Sutta-Pitaka.  Most of the matter is psychological and logical; the fundamental doctrines mentioned or discussed are those already propounded in the suttas and, therefore, taken for granted.  For a discussion of the contents see article on Abhidhamma in ERE.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the Commentaries on the seven books, an exegetical work on the whole Pitaka, called the Abhidhamma Mūlatīkā, was written by Ananda Vanaratanatissa of the Vanavāsī school in Ceylon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tīkā was evidently based on Buddhaghosa's Commentaries, but Ananda occasionally dissents from Buddhaghosa.  The work was written at the request of an Elder, Buddhamitta, and was revised by Mahā Kassapa of Pulatthipura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Anutīkā was written by Culla Dhammapāla.  Gv.60, 69. For details see P.L.C., pp.  210-12. The Gv.  (72) also mentions Abhidhammagandhi, probably a glossary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The brahmin exalts the knowledge of the three Vedas.  The Buddha tells him that a mere babbling of Vedic runes does not make a brahmin of a man who is defiled within and is deceitful.  He should have knowledge of former lives, of other worlds and of the higher lore (abhiññā) that gives cessation of birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggika-Bhāradvāja offers the Buddha the prepared meal as a fee for his teaching, but the Buddha rejects it because "the Buddhas do not accept wages." The brahmin should, if he so desire, extend his hospitality to him for his holiness, and not for his ability to chant verses.  S.i.166-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The dog used to amuse himself by swinging backwards and forwards on the elephant's trunk.  One day the merchant sold the dog.  The elephant went off his food and would not be consoled till the dog was brought back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to two monks of Sāvatthi who were very intimate with one another and spent all their time together.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abbhavalāhakā&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Cloud-group of devas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are embodied in the thunder clouds (cumulus clouds), and when they wish to revel and delight themselves, thunder clouds make their appearance in the sky.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached by the Buddha at Ambalatthikā (near Veluvana) to Rāhula.  It deals with falsehood.  Like a minute drop of water is the recluse ship of those who shrink not from deliberate lying, it is thrown away, upset; it is empty and void.  There is nothing evil they will not do, they run every risk, like an elephant who guards not his trunk.  One should practise constant reflection, thereby abandoning all things conducive to woe, either to oneself or to others, and develop self-control and purity (M.i.414-20).  Rāhula was evidently yet very young at the time of this sermon, for we find the Buddha making use of frequent similes, and pointing them out to him.  According to the Cy., he was at the time only 7 years old (MA.  ii.  636).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary says that it was preached because very young novices might be tempted to say things both proper and improper; they were likely to imagine things.  This sutta is to warn Rāhula against the use of lies (MA.ii.635f.; AA.i.145; ii.547).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta is among the portions of scripture mentioned in the Bhābrā Edict of Asoka as being essentially worthy of study by all monks (See Mookerji: Asoka, p.119) (v.l.  Ambalatthiya°).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhaya &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Abhaya Thera.&lt;/b&gt;-An arahant.  He was a Brahmin of Sāvatthi who, having heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order.  One day, while going to the village for alms, he was disturbed in mind by an attractively dressed woman, but he recollected himself and developed insight (Thag.v.98; ThagA.i.201-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a former birth he had met Sumedha Buddha in the forest and had offered him a wreath of salala-flowers.  Nineteen kappas ago he was born sixteen times as king, his name being Nimmita.  He is probably to be identified with the Thera Vatamsakiya of the Apadāna (i.174).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-Commonly called &lt;b&gt;Abhayarājakumāra&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt; and of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumavati,Padumavatī')"&gt;Padumavatī&lt;/a&gt;, the belle of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjeni')"&gt;Ujjeni&lt;/a&gt;.  When the boy was seven years old, his mother sent him to the king and he grew up with the boys of the court.  He first came under the influence of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta,Nigantha Nātaputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nātaputta&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him a dilemma to set the "Samana Gotama." In the Buddha's reply, the prince recognised the defeat of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/niganthaa,Nigantha')"&gt;Nigantha&lt;/a&gt; and the supreme Enlightenment of the Exalted One, whose disciple he then became.  Later, when the king died, Abhaya was disturbed in mind, and entered the Order.  On the occasion of the preaching of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/t1_th,Tālacchiggalūpama Sutta')"&gt;Tālacchiggalūpama Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (probably the same as S.v.455 and M.iii.169), he became a Stream-enterer and afterwards attained arahantship (Thag.26; ThagA.i.83-4 also ThagA.39. In ThagA.  his mother's name does not appear).  The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhayaraajakumaara_s,Abhayarājakumāra Sutta')"&gt;Abhayarājakumāra Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (M.i.392ff ) contains the dilemma episode.  It also mentions that at the time the prince had a little son of whom he was evidently very fond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.126-8) he is stated as having visited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gijjhakuuta,Gijjhakūta')"&gt;Gijjhakūta&lt;/a&gt; and discussed with him the views of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/purana_kassapa,Pūrana Kassapa')"&gt;Pūrana Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;.  The Buddha teaches him about the seven &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/b_f/bojjhanga,bojjhangas')"&gt;bojjhangas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Vinaya (i.269), Abhaya is mentioned as having discovered &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jiivaka,Jīvaka Komārabhacca')"&gt;Jīvaka Komārabhacca&lt;/a&gt; lying on a dung-heap (cast there by the orders of his mother, the courtesan Sālāvatī), and having brought him up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (i.216), on the other hand, says that Abhaya was Jīvaka's natural father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reward for quelling a disturbance on the frontier, Abhaya was given a skilled nautch girl by his father, Bimbisāra.  For seven days he enjoyed her company to the exclusion of all else, but on the seventh day she died.  Disconsolate, he sought comfort from the Buddha, who assuaged his grief (DhA.iii.166-67; cf.  the story of Santati).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna (ii.502-4) gives the story of his past.  He had been a brahmin of Hamsavatī, skilled in the Vedas; having heard the Buddha Padumuttara preach, he was converted and joined the Order, where he spent his time singing the greatness of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthā Commentary (i.83-4) quotes, in his story, some verses in the Apadāna, which in the Apadāna itself are ascribed to a Thera Ketakapupphiya.  They state that he offered a ketaka-flower to the Buddha Vipassī, Perhaps Ketakapupphiya was the title of another Thera, whose real name was Abhaya, and hence the stories were confused (ii.449-50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Abhaya (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A Licchavi of Vesāli generally (E.g., GS.i.200, n.2; ii.211, n.2; KS.v.107, n.2.), but wrongly, identified with Abhayarājakumāra.  On one occasion he comes with another Licchavi, Pandita Kumāraka, to Ananda in the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, and discusses with him certain views held by Nigantha Nātaputta.  Ananda teaches him the Buddha's three Ways of purification (For details see A.i.220-2).  On another occasion he visits the Buddha, again at Vesāli, with the Licchavi Sālha; the latter asks the Buddha's views on purity of morals and self-mortification.  The Buddha tells him of the Ariyan Way and explains its implications by various similes (See A.ii.202-4).  We are not told that either of them became converts on this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-A Thera.  He and Tissadatta Thera are mentioned together, in several Commentaries (DA.iii.786; MA.i.234; AA.i.273; VibhA.275) as examples of persons worthy of being associated with, because of their possession of ready attention (upatthita-sati).  This perhaps refers to Abhaya (1) or, more probably, to one of the three Abhayas mentioned with their titles in the Digha Commentary on the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DA.ii.530: Mahāgatimba-Abhaya, Dighabhānaka-Abhaya and Tipitaka Culābhaya) in its exegesis on the word upatthita-sati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;.  Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-King of Ceylon (then known as Ojadīpa) in the time of Kakusandha Buddha.  His capital was Abhayanagara.  Sp.i.86; Mhv.xv.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Ceylon (414-394 B.C.).  He was the eldest son of Panduvāsudeva and reigned in Upatissagāma.  Later, when the usurper Pandukābhaya came to the throne, he killed all his other nine uncles, sparing only Abhaya, because the latter had befriended both him and his mother, Ummādacittā.  (It was he who prevented Cittā from being killed at birth, Mhv.ix.3).  Abhaya was made Nagaraguttika (Guardian of the City), administering the government by night; he was the first holder of that office.  Mhv.ix.3, 9; x.52, 80, 105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Personal attendant of Atthadassī Buddha.  Bu.xv.19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Eldest son of King Mutasīva of Ceylon.  He renounced the succession in favour of his younger brother, Tissa, who later became known as Devānampiyatissa (MT.302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Father of Khañjadeva.  Mhv.xxiii.78.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A monk, chief of the ascetics who dwelt in the Pañca-parivenamūla monastery.  He was sent by King Kittisirimegha (q.v.) to fetch the king's son (Cv.lxvii.61).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Abhaya&lt;/b&gt;.-Author of the Mahātikā on Saddatthabhedacintā (Gv.63).  He was a native of Pagan, and is also credited with the authorship of the Sambhandhacintā-tīkā.  Bode, op.  cit., 22, and n.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-A brigand, commonly called Cora-Abhaya (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="13"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;.  Abhaya&lt;/b&gt; (Abhayupassaya).-A nunnery built by King Mahāsena.  Mhv.xxxvii.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Abhaya.&lt;/b&gt;-Nephew of Khallātanāga.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhidhānappadīpikā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pāli Dictionary written in the twelfth century by Moggallāna Thera of Ceylon, following the style and the method of the Sanskrit Amarakosa.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is in three parts, dealing with "celestial, terrestrial and miscellaneous objects," and each part is sub divided into several sections, which are not all mutually exclusive.  The whole book is a dictionary of synonyms, all the names given to one particular thing being grouped together and put into verse for the purpose of memorisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Samvannanā was written by a Burmese Officer-of-State under King Kittisīhasūra (A.D.  1351), and there exists a Burmese translation of the eighteenth century.  In Ceylon itself a sanna (paraphrase) and a tīkā have been written, the sanna being the older and by far the more valuable work.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayagiri&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A celebrated monastic establishment on the north side of Anurādhapura, consisting of a vihāra and a mighty thūpa.  Only the thūpa now stands.  It was built by King Vattagāmani Abhaya on the site of the ancient Titthārāma, 217 years, 10 months and 10 days after the founding of the Mahāvihāra (Mhv.xxxvii.78-83).  Tradition states that when the king was fleeing from the Tamils he passed the Titthārāma on his way, and the Nigantha Giri, who then lived there, made insulting remarks about him.  The king vowed, if he were returned to the throne, to build a vihāra on that spot (Mhv.xxxvii.43-4); he fulfilled his vow, and the name of the vihāra was a combination of his own name and of that of the Nigantha.  The monastery was given in charge of the Thera Mahātissa of Kuppikala and of two other monks, Kuppikala having befriended the king in his misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vihāra advanced rapidly in wealth and in power, but quite soon the monks seceded from the Mahāvihāra fraternity because, according to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxxvii.95ff), an incumbent of the Mahāvihāra, Mahātissa by name, was expelled from the monastery for frequenting lay families.  His disciple, Bahalamassutissa, went in anger to Abhayagiri and formed a separate faction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Sinhalese chronicle, the Nikāya Sahgraha (pp.11, 12; also P.L.C.42), states that these dissentients were soon after joined by a body of Vajjiputtaka monks from the Pallārāma in India, under the leadership of a teacher called Dhammaruci, and the sect which they together founded in Ceylon became known as the Dhammaruci Nikāya, with headquarters in Abhayagiri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quite a long while the two fraternities, that of the Mahāvihāra and that of the Abhayagiri, seem to have lived in amity, alike enjoying the munificence of patrons (Ibid., 52f.; Mhv.xxxv.20, 57, 119-22; xxxvi.7-14).  Thus, Gajabāhukagāmani raised the height of Abhayuttara-thūpa (as the thūpa at Abhayagiri seems to have been called) and made the Gāmanitissa-tank to be used for the cultivation of land for the maintenance of the vihara (Ibid., xxxv.119-22); Kanitthatissa built a splendid structure in the same vihāra for the Thera Mahānāga; it was called the Ratanapāsāda (xxxvi.7, 8.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the reign of Vohārakatissa, the Abhayagiri monks openly adopted the heretical Vaitulya Pitaka (of the Mahāyānists see Mhv.  trans.  259, n.2).  An inquiry was held by the king with the help of his minister Kapila, the heretical books were burnt and the monks of Abhayagiri disgraced (Mhv.xxxvi.40-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon afterwards, however, the heretics won over the king Mahāsena to their side and destroyed the establishment of the Mahāvihāra, carrying away all the materials to Abhayagiri (P.L.C.  53; Mhv.xxxvii.10-16).  Later, Mahāsena repented of his ways, burnt the books of the Abhayagiri monks and transferred his patronage to the Mahāvihāra.  But the Abhayagiri fraternity must soon have recovered its prestige, for we find Mahāsena's successor, Sirimeghavanna, planting a bodhi tree (called Tissavasabha) (Cv.trans.  i.9, n.3) in Abhayagiri and surrounding it with a stone terrace ((Cv.xxxvii.91)).  A few years later both Mahānāma (409-31) and his queen became active supporters of Abhaya Giri (Cv.xxxvii.212).  Dhātusena is stated to have enlarged the Abhayuttara-vihāra (Cv.xxxviii.61), and Silākāla is credited with several benefactions to the vihāra and its bodhi tree (Cv.xli.31-2); Mahānāga gave the weaver's village of Jambela to the Uttaravihāra (another name for Abhayagiri; see Cv.  trans.  i.8, n.2; 61, n.6.); Aggabodhi I.  built a bathing-tank there (Cv.xlii.28), while his successor, Aggabodhi II., built the Dāthāggabodhi house, so called after himself and his queen (Cv.xlii.63-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the monastery at Abhayagiri there seems to have been a stone image of the Buddha, referred to under various names, Silāsambuddha, Kālasela, Kālasatthā, Silāsatthā and Silāmayamuninda.  Cv.xxxix.7; xxxviii.65; 61.2; see also vv.51, 77, 87. There was also in Abhayagiri another image called the Abhiseka (q.v.).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was evidently held peculiarly sacred.  Buddhadāsa placed a nāgamani in its eye (Cv.xxxvii.123); this was soon lost, and we find Dhātusena replacing it, adorning and decorating the statue in various ways (For details see Cv.xxxviii.62ff).  Silāmeghavanna had it restored and redecorated and made provision for its maintenance (Cv.xliv.68).  The same king, we are told, attempted to carry out a reform of the Abhayagiri monks, but this attempt ultimately brought disaster on him (Cv.xliv.75ff).  Jetthatissa gave to the vihāra the village of Mahādāragiri (Cv.xliv.96).  Dāthopatissa built the Kappūra-parivena attached to the vihāra, and also a monastery Tiputthulla, encroaching on the precincts of the Mahāvihāra, notwithstanding the protests of the monks belonging to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latter (Cv.xlv.29ff).  Aggabodhi VII, added the Sabhattudesabhoga (Cv.xlviii.64), and Mahinda II.  the Mahālekha-parivena as well as the many-storeyed Ratanapāsāda with its costly ornamentation (Cv.xlviii.135-40; see also Geiger's trans.  123, n.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena I.  built the Virankurārāma and gave it to the Mahāsanghikas (Cv.l.68-9), while his consort, Sanghā, erected a dwelling house, Mahindasena (Cv.l.79), and his courtier, Uttara, yet another dwelling house, called Uttarasena, for the maintenance of which he provided.  Two other courtiers, Vajira and Rakkhasa, built two dwelling houses, called respectively Vajirasenaka and Rakkhasa (Cv.l.83).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Sena II.  the Pamsukulika monks, who till then had evidently lived in Abhayagiri (Cv.  trans.  i.108, n.1), separated and formed special groups.  Sanghā, queen of Udaya II., erected and endowed the building known as the Sanghasenapabbata (Cv.li.86-7).  Kassapa IV.  built a pāsāda bearing his name and assigned to it a village (Cv.lii.13; Cv.trs.  i.162, n.4), while his successor, Kassapa V., erected the Bhandikā-parivena and the Silāmeghapabbata, endowing each with a village (Cv.lii.58-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sena III.  spent 40,000 kahāpanas for a stone paving round the cetiya.  The Abhayagiri monks befriended both Vijayabāhu I.  (then known as Kitti) and his brother, and out of gratitude Vijayabāhu built the Uttaramūla-parivena, which was probably attached to the vihara itself (Cv.lvii.18, 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the reign of Parakkamabāhu I., when that monarch had established himself on the throne, it is said that he tried to reform the monks of the Abhayagiri, but he found the task hopeless (Cv.lxxviii.21ff).  He found that the Abhayagiri-thūpa had been destroyed by the vandalism of the Tamils, and he had it restored to a height of 160 cubits (Cv.lxxviii.98).  When Anurādhapura was finally abandoned, Abhayagiri fell into ruin and decay, the monastery being completely destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that even at the outset there was considerable rivalry between the monks of Abhayagiri and those of the Mahāvihāra.  The rivalry seems originally to have been mainly personal, but it later developed into differences in doctrinal opinion.  Of the exact nature of these latter we have no information, owing, chiefly, to the book-burnings carried out by pious kings in the excess of their zeal for the purity of the Faith.  For the same reason we are unable to ascertain what part, if any, the Abhayagiri fraternity played in literary activity.  It has been suggested, however, that both the Jātakatthakathā (P.L.C.124, 125) and the Sahassavatthuppakarana (P.L.C.128), another compilation of tales, were the work of the Abhayagiri monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fa-Hsien evidently spent the two years of his stay in Ceylon with the Abhayagiri fraternity because the books he took away with him were those of the unorthodox schools.  According to him, there were, at this time, 5,000 monks in Abhayagiri (Fa Hsien's Travels, 67ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the chronicles Abhayagiri is referred to under several names Abhayuttara, Abhayavihāra, Abhayācala and Uttaravihāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alāta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minister and general of Angati, King of Videha.  He is described as wise, smiling, a father of sons and full of experience.  When Angati consulted his ministers as to ways and means of finding diversion for himself and his subjects, Alāta's counsel was that they should set out to battle with a countless host of men.  The suggestion of another minister, Vijaya, was that the king should visit some samana or brahmin, and this idea it was that won the king's approval.  Thereupon Alāta persuaded Angati to visit the Ājīvika Guna of the Kassapa family, who evidently enjoyed Alāta's patronage.  When Guna preached his doctrine that good and evil actions were alike fruitless, he was supported by Alāta, who stated that in a previous birth he had been Pingala, a cowkilling huntsman in Benares, and that he had committed many sins for which, however, he had never suffered any evil consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Angati's daughter Rujā explains that Alāta's present prosperity is the result of certain past acts of righteousness and that time will eventually bring him suffering on account of his evil deeds.  Alāta himself, she says, is not aware of this because he can remember only one previous birth, while she herself can recall seven.  See the Mahā Nārada-Kasappa Jātaka (J.vi.222ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alāta was a previous birth of Devadatta (J.vi.255).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text he is sometimes (E.g., pp.221, 230) also called Alātaka, perhaps for the purposes of metre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acchagallaka (or Acchagiri)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vihāra built by King &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suuratissa,Sūratissa')"&gt;Sūratissa&lt;/a&gt; to the east of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuraadhapura,Anurādhapura')"&gt;Anurādhapura&lt;/a&gt; and near Dahegallaka (Mhv.xxi.60).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa Tīka (MT.424), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devaanampiyatissa,Devānampiyatissa')"&gt;Devānampiyatissa&lt;/a&gt; had also built an Acchavihāra to the south of the city, and in order that one might be distinguished from the other, Sūratissa's work was called Purimāyacchagallaka.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was there that Vattāgamani Abhaya held a festival in honour of the Buddha with the help of the Thera Mahātissa of Kuppikkala.

He visited the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujunnaa,Ujuññā')"&gt;Ujuññā&lt;/a&gt; in the Kanna-katthala deer-park and asked him if it were true that he disparaged all penance and reviled ascetics.  Their conversation is recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kassapasiihanaada_s,Kassapa-Sīhanāda Sutta ')"&gt;Kassapa-Sīhanāda Sutta &lt;/a&gt; (D.i.161ff).  After the usual four months' probation, he joined the Order and in due course became an arahant (D.i.177; but according to DA.i.363 he was ordained forthwith).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Majjhima Nikāya (M.iii.124ff.; also AA.i.171) we are told that he was an old friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula,Bakkula Thera')"&gt;Bakkula Thera&lt;/a&gt;, and that after a conversation with him obtained his ordination (under him).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Acela-Kassapa (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Acela-Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-An old family friend of Cittagapahati.  Having been for thirty years a paribbājaka, he admits to Citta that he had thereby obtained no particular excellence of knowledge.  Citta tells him of his own attainments and Kassapa expresses a desire to enter the Order.  He is duly ordained, and shortly afterwards becomes an arahant.  S.iv.300ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Acela-Kassapa.&lt;/b&gt;-The Kassapa mentioned in the Acela Sutta (S.ii.18f.; see also SA.ii.26f), probably to be identified with Acela-Kassapa (1), though the stories of their conversions are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adinnapubbaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of Sāvatthi, father of Mattakundalī, so called because he never gave anything to anyone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, later, Mattakundalī, having been born in heaven, visits him and persuades him to take refuge with the Buddha, he invites the Buddha with his monks to a meal at his house.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the meal Mattakundalī appears again and Adinnapubbaka, after listening to the Buddha's preaching, attains the First Fruit of the Path.

It was at a spot between the territories of the Alaka and the Assaka kings that Bāvarī lived (Sn.977).  To the north of Alaka was Patitthāna.  Sn.1011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

He had been a Dānava named Romasa and had given a cluster of mangoes to Vipassī Buddha.  Ap.i.147.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Ambapindiya&lt;/b&gt;.-An arahant.  He had been an elephant in the time of Siddattha Buddha.  Having seen the Buddha in the forest, the elephant gave him a bunch of mangoes.  As a result he was born in Tusita.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahimsaka Bhāradvāja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja,Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; brothers.  He came to the Buddha at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; and the Buddha suggested to him the desirability of living up to his name by practising &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ahimsaka_bh,ahimsā')"&gt;ahimsā&lt;/a&gt;.  It is said that later he became an arahant (S.i.164).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (SA.i.179) is uncertain as to the reason for the name which he says was given to him by the Recensionists.  He suggests that he was so called, either because his actual name was such, or because of the nature of the discussion between him and the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ahirika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ahirika Sutta.-A man who is void of faith, virtue and shame is destined to be born in hell.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajita-Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a poor brahmin family of Sāvatthi, and was so called because at birth he was wrapped in an antelope skin.  He saw the presentation of Jetavana and, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha, joined the Order and later became an arahant.  But because of past misdeeds he remained unhonoured and unknown, and on this account was despised by worldly novices (Thag.129-30; ThagA.i.250f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently to be identified with Ghatamandadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.436).  In a previous birth he gave butter as medicine to the Pacceka Buddha, Sucintita.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambapālivana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grove presented by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambapaalii,Ambapālī')"&gt;Ambapālī&lt;/a&gt; to the Buddha and the Order.  It was in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vesaali,Vesāli')"&gt;Vesāli&lt;/a&gt; and was given to the Buddha during his last tour in that town, at the conclusion of the meal to which Ambapālī had invited him (Vin.i.231-3).  But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed there previously during their visits to Vesāli (thus according to D.ii.94 the Buddha was already in the grove before Ambapālī visited him; see also S.v.301, which must refer to an incident before the Buddha's last tour, because Sāriputta was still alive).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is stated to have preached three suttas in the grove, two of them being on the value of the &lt;a href="http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/satipatthaana,satipatthānā')"&gt;satipatthānā&lt;/a&gt; (S.v.141ff).  In the third sutta (A.iv.100-6) he dwells on the impermanence of all sankhāras and proceeds to describe the process by which the whole world will ultimately be destroyed by seven suns arising in the world and drying everything up.  In this sutta appears also the story of the teacher &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sunetta,Sunetta')"&gt;Sunetta&lt;/a&gt;, who, even after becoming the Great Brahma, is yet subject to old age and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samyutta also records a conversation that took place between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anuruddha,Anuruddha')"&gt;Anuruddha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; during a stay in Ambapālivana (S.v.301).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grove was planted with mangoes and was so called because it belonged to Ambapālī.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambacora Jātaka (No.  344)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a wicked ascetic who built for himself a hut in a mango orchard on the river bank near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and ate the ripe mangoes as they fell.  In order to frighten him Sakka made the orchard appear as if it had been plundered by thieves.  The ascetic, coming back from his begging-round and seeing what had happened, charged the four daughters of a merchant who had just entered the garden with having stolen the mangoes.  They denied the charge and swore dreadful oaths to support their statement.  Thereupon he let them go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told about an Elder who had entered the Order in his old age and who, instead of practising his duties, looked after mangoes.  Thieves stole his mangoes, and he charged with the theft the four daughters of a rich merchant who happened to visit the park.  They swore oaths to prove that they were not guilty and were released.  J.iii.137-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhibhū&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Abhibhū.&lt;/b&gt;-Chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha (D.ii.9; J.i.41; Bu.xxi.20).  In the Arunavatī Sutta it is said that he went with Sikhī to a Brahma-world and, at the Buddha's request, preached a sermon to the accompaniment of great magical powers.  He proved that by using just such speech as if he were preaching to a gathering of monks, he could, standing in the Brahma-world, make his voice heard by its thousand realms (S.i.154f).  The verses spoken on this occasion are, in the Theragāthā, ascribed to Abhibhūta (v.1147-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Anguttara Nikāya (i.226f.; AA.i.436f ) we find Ananda asking the Buddha how far Abhibhū's powers bore relation to those of a Buddha, and the Buddha replying that Abhibhū was a mere disciple, and proceeding to describe the immeasurable powers of the Tathāgata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhibhū was a brahmin because we find him so addressed in the Arunavatī Sutta referred to above, but in the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.202) he is spoken of as a rājaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Patisambhidhāmagga Commentary (488f ) his story is given as an example of vikubbana-iddhi whereby a person could make himself seen in many places at the same time.  We are told that he developed nīlakasina, to attract to himself the attention of the world systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera Adhopupphiya had been a hermit in Himavā during the time of Sikhī Buddha and had offered flowers to Abhibhū.  Ap.i.128-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Abhibhū.&lt;/b&gt;-A class of devas belonging to the Arūpa-plane (M.i.1).  They live in the same plane as the Vehapphalā.  In the Mūlapariyāya Sutta the word is used to denote all the Asaññasattādevā.  Buddhaghosa explains the word by saying abhibhavī ti Abhibhū; kim abhibhavī ti ? cattāro khandhe, arūpino.  They are beautiful and long-lived, and are therefore considered to be eternal and identical with Brahmā (MA.i.30).  In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.329) the Buddha claims to be Abhibhū (=the conqueror).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Abhibhū.&lt;/b&gt;-The name of a Bodhisatta who obtained vivarana under Gotama.  He will become the sixth Buddha after Gotama.  Anāgata Vamsa, p.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Abhibhū Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-On the immeasurableness of a Buddha's powers.  A.i.226f.; also called the Sīhanada Sutta in the Commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Abhibhū Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-On the eight stages or stations of mastery over the senses (abhibhāyaphanāni) (A.iv.305f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Amaravatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Amaravatī.-Also called Amara.  A city in the time of Dipankara Buddha.  Sumedha was born there in a very rich family and renounced the world after having given his wealth away (Bu.ii.5; J.i.6; DhA.i.83, etc.).  According to the Mahābodhivamsa (p.2) the city was so called because it was inhabited by men like gods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Amaravatī.-A city in the time of Kondañña Buddha eighteen leagues in extent.  It was in the Devavanā, near the city, that Kondañña preached his first sermon (v.l.  Arundhavatī).  BuA.108-9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Amaravatī.-The city of Sakka, king of the gods.  Sp.i.49; Cv.lxxx.5; it is described in the Mahābhārata iii.1714ff.; see also Hopkins, Epic Mythology, 140f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhirūpa-Nandā Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was born in Kapilavatthu as the daughter of the chief of the Sākiyan Khemaka and was named Nandā.  Owing to her great beauty and charm she became known as Abhirūpā-Nandā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day appointed for her to select her husband, the Sākiyan youth, on whom her choice was to have fallen, died, and her parents made her leave the world against her will.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna account (ii.  609) does not mention the suitor's death, but states that many sought her hand and caused great trouble, to avoid which her parents made her join the Order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after she had entered the Order she avoided going into the Buddha's presence, being infatuated with her own beauty and fearing the Master's rebuke.  In order to induce her to come to him, the Buddha directed Mahā Pajāpatī to see that all the nuns came for instruction.  When Nandā's turn came she sent another in her place.  The Buddha refused to recognise the substitute, and Nandā was compelled to go herself.  As she listened to the Buddha preaching, he, by his magic power, conjured up a beautiful woman and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandā's heart.  At the opportune moment, the Buddha drove home the truth of the impermanence of beauty.  Meditating on this topic, she later became an arahant (ThigA.81f.  ; SnA.i.241-2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two verses preached to her by the Buddha, which she made the subject of her meditations, are given in the Therīgāthā (vv.19, 20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha, Nandā had been the daughter of a wealthy burgess in the Buddha's native town of Bandhumatī.  Having heard the Buddha preach she became his pious follower, and, at his death, made an offering of a golden umbrella decked with jewels to the shrine built over his ashes (Ap.ii.608).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verses quoted in the Therīgāthā Commentary, as having been taken from the Apadāna, really belong to Mettā, and are found in the Apadāna (ii.  515) ascribed to Ekapindadāyikā.  The correct verses are found in the Apadāna under the name of Abhirūpa Nandā, and agree with the story given in the text of the Therīgāthā Commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Amara.&lt;/b&gt;-A city in the time of Siddhattha Buddha.  The Buddha, being there, made his way to the pleasaunce (Amaruyyāna) of the city, leaving his footprints to show his path.  The two chiefs of the city, Sambahula and Sumitta, brothers, seeing the footmarks, went themselves to the pleasaunce, and having listened to the Buddha's preaching became arahants (BuA.186).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambatitthaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ambatitthaka.-A Tamil stronghold surrounded by a river and a moat; it was captured by Dutthagāmani after a siege of four months (Mhv.xxv.7-9).  The crafty Damila Titthamba lived there, and it is said that, in the end, he was conquered by a conspiracy in which Dutthagāmani offered to allow him to marry Dutthagāmani's mother (MT.473f).  Near here was a ford across the Mahāvāluka-gangā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ambatitthaka.-A Jatila living at Ambatittha (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He was tutor to King Narapatisithu of Pagan (Bode, 16).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gandha-Vamsa calls him a native of Jambudīpa (p.67), but his name occurs among the famous residents in the retired monastery of the northern plateau above Pagan, the cradle of Pāli-Burmese literature.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alasandā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in the land of the Yonas.  There was a large Buddhist community there and it is said, in the Mahāvamsa (xxix.40), that on the occasion of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa by Dutthagāmani, the thera Yonaka Mahā Dhammarakkhita came to Anurādhapura from Alasanda with 30,000 monks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milindapañha (p.327) Alasandā is mentioned in a list of places, among which are China, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt; and Gandhāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the same book (82,83), King Milinda is mentioned as saying that he was born in a village named Kalasi in Alasandā, but he speaks of Alasandā as an island.  It was about two hundred leagues from Sāgala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted (E.g., in Questions of King Milinda, i., p.xxiii, see also CHI., p.550) that Alasandā was the name of an island in the Indus in the territory of Baktria.  Geiger (Mhv.trs.194, n.3) thinks that it is probably to be identified with the town founded by the Macedonian king in the country of Paropanisadae near Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Apadāna (i.359) the Alasandakā are mentioned in a list of tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhidhammāvatāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Abhidhamma treatise by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhadatta,Buddhadatta')"&gt;Buddhadatta&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uragapura,Uragapura')"&gt;Uragapura&lt;/a&gt;.  The book was written in India in the Cola country.  It is an introduction to the study of the Abhidhamma, and there is much similarity between it and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/visuddhi_magga,Visuddhi Magga')"&gt;Visuddhi Magga&lt;/a&gt;, though Buddhadatta's diction is less involved and ambiguous than that of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt;; his vocabulary is extraordinarily rich and his style more graphic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is mostly in verse with, here and there, a prose commentary supplied by the author himself (Gv.69; see P.L.C.  107-8 for details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tīkās on it exist, one by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaacissara,Vācissara')"&gt;Vācissara&lt;/a&gt; Mahāsāmi of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavihara,Mahāvihara')"&gt;Mahāvihara&lt;/a&gt; and the other by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sumangala,Sumangala')"&gt;Sumangala&lt;/a&gt;, pupil of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt;.  Sās.34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gv.  (p.69) says that Buddhadatta wrote it at the request of his pupil Sumati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alīnacitta Jātaka (No.  156)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story of the Bodhisatta, when he was born as Alīnacitta, King of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elephant, while walking in the forest, trod on a splinter of acacia wood left there by carpenters while felling forest trees for wood for buildings in Benares.  In great pain he came to the carpenters and lay down before them.  They removed the splinter and owing to their treatment the wound healed.  The elephant, in gratitude, spent the rest of his life working for them, and, before his death, he enlisted his son, white in colour, magnificent and high-bred, in their service.  One day a half-dry cake of the young one's dung was carried into the river by the flood (we are told that noble animals never dung or stale in water), and, floating down, stuck near the bathing place of the king's elephants in Benares.  The royal elephants, scenting the noble animal, refused to enter the water and fled.  Having discovered the reason for their behaviour, the king decided to obtain the animal for himself, and going up-stream in a raft, he saw the carpenters and the white elephant working for them.  The merchants agreed to give him to the king, but the elephant refused to move till the carpenters were adequately compensated.  The animal was taken in procession to the city and with his help the king became supreme ruler over India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In course of time the Queen Consort bore a son to the king, but the king died before his birth.  The Kosala king thereupon laid siege to Benares, but desisted from attack for seven days, astrologers having predicted that at the end of that time the child would be born.  The men of Benares had agreed to surrender unless the baby proved to be a boy.  After seven days the queen bore a son named Alīnacitta, and the in habitants of Benares gave battle to the Kosala king.  The queen, being told that they were in danger of defeat, dressed the baby and took him to the elephant for protection.  The elephant had been kept in ignorance of the king's death, lest he himself should die of a broken heart.  But, on hearing the news, he sallied forth into battle and soon brought back the Kosala king as captive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alīnacitta became, in due course, king over the whole of Jambudīpa (J.ii.17-23).  This story and that of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samvara_jat_462,Samvara Jātaka')"&gt;Samvara Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; were both related in connection with a monk who had become faint-hearted.  For details see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samvara,Samvara')"&gt;Samvara&lt;/a&gt;.  The elephant of the Jātaka was the faint-hearted monk and the father-elephant was Sāriputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Jātaka also was related by the Buddha, with reference to the Elder &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/radha,Rādha')"&gt;Rādha&lt;/a&gt; whom Sāriputta had taken under his special spiritual protection and guidance, in gratitude for a ladleful of food that Rādha, as layman, had once given him.  The Buddha pointed out that this was not the first time that Sāriputta had shown his gratitude (DhA.ii.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayarājakumāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains the episode of Prince &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/abhaya,Abhaya')"&gt;Abhaya&lt;/a&gt; visiting the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; and setting him the questions suggested by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nigantha_nataputta,Nigantha Nātaputta')"&gt;Nigantha Nātaputta&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would a &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tathaagata,Tathāgatha')"&gt;Tathāgatha&lt;/a&gt; say anything unpleasant or disagreeable to others? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he did, how would he differ from ordinary men? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he did not, how was it that the Buddha spoke of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/devadatta,Devadatta')"&gt;Devadatta&lt;/a&gt; as a reprobate, a child of perdition, etc.  - words which angered and upset Devadatta?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha answered that the question needed qualification and, noticing that the prince was nursing his little boy, who lay in his lap, asked him what he would do if a pebble or a stick got into his mouth.  "I should pull it out even if the blood flowed." "Just so would a Buddha state unpleasant truths in due season if necessary and profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the discourse Abhaya accepts the Buddha as his Teacher (M.i.391ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accharā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected with a monk, who, through over-exertion, died as he leaned against the terrace-post.  His life-work unfinished, he is born in Tāvatimsa leaning against a door-post.  Accosted by the nymphs with song and music, he thinks he is yet a monk till they bring a cheval-glass and reveal to him his figure.  In disappointment he seeks the Master, who preaches to him.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggapīthaka-pāsāda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building in the inner city of Anurādhapura.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that when Ilanāga entered the city in splendour, after the festival at the Tissa-tank, his chariot was drawn by his former enemies, the Lambakannas, who were yoked to the chariot, and that the line thus made extended from the tank to the Aggapīthaka-pāsāda.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aggañña Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seventh of the Digha Nikāya (D.iii.80f).  It is a kind of Buddhist book of Genesis, dealing, among other things, with the evolution of the world, of man and of society.  The pretensions of the brahmins to be the legitimate heirs of Brahma are examined and rejected; righteousness is declared to be above lineage.  (For a summary of the sutta see Dial.  i.105f.  Cf: Madhura Sutta).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was preached to Vāsettha and Bhāradvāja at the Pubbārāma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger portion of this sutta (from the beginning of the genesis part to the election of the first king) is found in the Mahāvastu (i.338-48).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alajanapada&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A district which the thera Isidatta visited on his return journey from a pilgrimage to the Mahā-Vihāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children of Alajanapada collected some fruit-rinds, which had been left behind by the fruit-gatherers, and gave them to Isidatta and his companion, Mahāsona.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that this was the only meal they had for a week.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adhimutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Adhimutta.-A Brahmin of Sāvatthi.  Dissatisfied with Brahmin learning, he looked for salvation elsewhere, and hearing the Buddha preach at the presentation of Jetavana, entered the Order, becoming an arahant in due course (ThagA.i.224).  A verse addressed by him to some corpulent monks is found in the Theragāthā (v.114).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Padumuttara's time he was a learned Brahmin and became an ascetic.  Later he met the Buddha, offered him a bark-robe and uttered his praises in song.  He is probably identical with Sabbakittika of the Apadāna (i.323-4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Adhimutta.-See Atimuttaka (2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhimutti Sutta.-Preached to Ananda on the ten powers of a Tathāgata.  A.v.36f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ambagāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Ambagāma.-A village in Ceylon near Pulatthipura identified with the modern Ambagamuva.  A battle was fought there between the forces of Gajabāhu and Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxx.321) Parakkamabāhu II.  built a bridge, thirty-four cubits in length, over the Khajjotanadī at Ambagāma.  Ibid., lxxxvi.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ambagāma.-One of the villages near Vesāli visited by the Buddha on his last tour (D.ii.123).  It was between Bhandagāma and Bhoganagara, on the road from Vesāli to Kusināra.  This was evidently the road which led from Vesāli northwards to the Malla Country, for other villages in the vicinity of Ambagāma were Hatthigāma and Jambugāma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that Anupiya, although in the Malla country, is not mentioned in the list of these villages.  Thomas (Op.  cit., 148, n.1) thinks that this is because the route to Kusināra passed to the east of Anupiya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ajitakesakambala (Ajitakesakambalī)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of one of the six heretical sects mentioned in the Pitakas as being contemporaneous with the Buddha.  He is described as a Titthaka (heretical teacher), leader of a large following, virtuous and held in esteem by the people (S.i.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/samannaphala_s,Sāmaññaphala Sutta')"&gt;Sāmaññaphala Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.55), where &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt; describes a visit paid to&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajita,Ajita')"&gt;Ajita&lt;/a&gt;, he taught the doctrine of "cutting off," i.e.  annihilation at death.  He was a nihilist who believed in neither good nor evil.  In Tibetan sources he is stated to have taught that all beings must dwell in Samsara for 84,000 mahākalpas before they come to an end; nothing can prevent that (Rockhill: 103-4).  The answer Ajita gave to Ajātasattu is given elsewhere (E.g., S.iii.207; M.i.515) as being the view of a typical sophist.  His name is often introduced into the stereotyped list of the six teachers even where the views they are alleged to have expressed do not coincide with those attributed to Ajita in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta.  E.g., S.iv.398, where he is represented as talking about the rebirths of his adherents - he who denied rebirth.  In A.i.286 he seems to have been confused with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/makkhali_gosala,Makkhali Gosāla')"&gt;Makkhali Gosāla&lt;/a&gt;.  He was called Kesakambali because he wore a blanket of human hair, which is described as being the most miserable garment.  It was cold in cold weather, hot in the hot, evil-smelling and uncouth (DA.i.144; MA.i.422-3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahabodhi_jat_528,Mahābodhi Jātaka')"&gt;Mahābodhi Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; the Buddha had already refuted Ajita's view in previous births (J.v.246).  Ajita was evidently much older in years than the Buddha, for we find &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pasenadi,Pasenadi')"&gt;Pasenadi&lt;/a&gt;, in the early years of his friendship with the Buddha, telling him that he was a young novice compared with Ajita.  S.i.68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/milindapanha,Milinda-pañha')"&gt;Milinda-pañha&lt;/a&gt; the king says that he had visited a teacher named Ajitakesakambala.  This cannot possibly refer to our Ajita; the reference is probably to a teacher belonging to the same school of thought ("There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil karma," p.4. His views are given on p.25 without mention being made of his name.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Akkosaka-Bhāradvāja&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt; who - incensed that his eldest brother, a member of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bhaaradvaaja,Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; clan and, probably its head, (KS.i.201, n.  4; see also Dhānañjānī) had been converted by the Buddha - visits the Buddha and insults him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he is himself converted and becomes an arahant (S.i.161f.; MA.i.808).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soubriquet of Akkosaka was given him by the Sangītikārā to distinguish him as the author of a lampoon of 500 verses against the Buddha (SA.i.177).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asurindaka_bh,Asurindaka-Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Asurindaka-Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; was his younger brother (SA.i.178); he had two others, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/sundarika_bhaaradvaaja,Sundarī Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Sundarī Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bilangika,Bilangika-Bhāradvāja')"&gt;Bilangika-Bhāradvāja&lt;/a&gt;, who also became converts and, later, arahants.

Amaragiri.-One of the three palaces occupied by Atthadassī Buddha during his lay life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bu.xv.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Amaragiri,-A monastery in Ceylon, in which lived the Elder Vanaratana.  In the time of Bhuvanekabāhu IV.  it seems to have been the home of the orthodox monks.  P.L.C.240.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Abhayarāja-parivena&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A building erected by King Vijayabāhu IV.  in connection with the Vanaggāmapāsāda Vihāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He built it in order that he might give the merits arising there from to his father, Parakkamabāhu II.  It was richly endowed (Cv.lxxxviii.51-2; Cv.  trans.  ii.186, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isidāsa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera.  He had a brother, also a monk, named Isibhatta.  Having spent the rainy season in Sāvatthi, they went to take up their abode in a certain village.  The people there gave them food and robes, but they refused to accept their share of these, because, according to the rule, the robes are the property of the Sangha until the Kathina-ceremony has been performed.  The story is mentioned in connection with accepting robes elsewhere than in the spot where the rainy season has been spent.  Vin.i.299.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Inda.&lt;/b&gt;-Given in the Ātānātiya Sutta as the name of the ninety-one sons of Dhatarattha, king of the Gandhabbas.  They are represented as being of great strength and followers of the Buddha (D.iii.197).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name is also given as that of the ninety-one sons of Virūlha, king of the Kumbhandas (D.iii.198); of Virūpakkha, king of the Nāgas (p.199); and of Kuvera, king of the Yakkhas (p.202).  Further on in the same sutta, Inda is mentioned with Soma, Varuna and others as a Yakkha, to whom appeal should be made by disciples of the Buddha when needing protection (p.204).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Mahā Samaya Sutta (D.ii.257f), also, Inda is mentioned as the name of the Sons of the Regent Gods of the Four Quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Inda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pāli equivalent of the Vedic Indra.  He is referred to only very seldom in the Nikāyas.  In one such passage (D.i.244-5) he is mentioned with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma,Soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna,Varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/iisaana,Isāna')"&gt;Isāna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pajapati,Pajāpati')"&gt;Pajāpati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"&gt;Brahmā&lt;/a&gt;, Mahiddi and Yāma, as a god whom brahmins invoke and pray to, for union with Brahma after death.  In another place, he is described as being seated in the company of Pajāpati and other gods in the Assembly Hall, named Sudhamma.  Two of his companions, having listened to the admonition of Gopaka, became disciples of the Buddha and, as a result, far surpassed in glory Inda and his other companion devas.  In the same context, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vaasava,Vāsava')"&gt;Vāsava&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the gods, identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, is addressed by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gopaka,Gopaka')"&gt;Gopaka&lt;/a&gt; as "Indra." (Ibid., ii.274; in M.i.140; J.v.411 and vi.568, he is mentioned with Brahmā and Pajāpati; in J.iv.568, 571 is a list in which Inda appears with Brahmā, Pajāpati, Soma, Yama and Vessavana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time of the compilation of the Nikāyas, the hold of the Vedic god Indra on the mind of the people seems to have become greatly weakened and Indra has been merged in Sakka, although, strictly speaking, Indra and Sakka are quite different conceptions.  (See Sakka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the later literature, however, particularly in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jaatakatthakathaa,Jātakatthakathā')"&gt;Jātakatthakathā&lt;/a&gt;, Indra's name occurs frequently, but always as identified or identifiable with Sakka.  In one place at least (J.v.115) the scholiast says, "Sakko ti Indo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/ayakuuta_jat_347,Ayakūta Jātaka')"&gt;Ayakūta Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.146), for example, Indra is called king of the gods (devārājā) in one verse, and in the next he is identified with Maghavā, husband of Sujā, and described as "devānam indo." Indra is most revered of the gods (Sn.vs.316).  He is free from old age and death, and is, therefore, the happiest type of king (Sn.vs.515), a condition that could be attained by sacrifice (Sn.vs.517).  Alone he conquered the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asura,Asuras')"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.347; he is therefore called Asurinda and Asurādhipa ; see Asura).  He is spoken of, as the lord of victors (jayatam pati) (J.v.322), and he is the embodiment of the greatest valour (Mhv.xxx.10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes he visits the earth in disguise (J.v.33).  He is also represented as punishing people guilty of heinous crimes; with his thunderbolt he smites them (DhA.iv.105).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene of his pleasures is in the Nandana pleasance (J.v.158), and his is the ideal enjoyment of pleasure, surrounded by friends (J.v.506; Sn.v.679) and by adoring wives (J.vi.240).  The gods of Tāvatimsa are called Inda-purohitā, because, with Inda as their chief, they seek to promote the welfare of gods and men (J.vi.127; the Tāvatimsa gods are also described as being Sa-Indakā, ibid., 568).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inda is called Tidivapuravara and Suravaratara (D.iii.176).  His capital is Masakkasāra (J.vi.271; but see Amarāvatī).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sacrifice the palāsayatthi (Butea shoot), used by the sacrificing priest, is described as Indra's right hand (J.vi.212).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indra's gotta, or clan, is the Kosiya (J.vi.501) ; he is called Vatrabhū in reference to his victory over Vatra (Skt.  Vrtra) (J.v.153), and mention is made of his thunderbolt, the Indavajira (J.i.354) ; thus he is called Vajirahattha (D.ii.259; DA.ii.689).  The sound of Indra's thunderbolt striking its victim, surpasses all other sounds by its intensity, its volume and its fearfulness (UdA.67); no obstruction can stop the progress of Indra's Vajira and it never misses its mark; it is avirajjhanaka (VibhA.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his victory over the Asuras, images of him were made (Indapatimā) and placed round Cittakūta to frighten the Asuras away, in case they attempted to retrieve their lost honour (J.vi.125-6; see also J.i.203-4; DhA.i.280).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be born into the company of Indra (Indasahavyatā) is considered very fortunate (E.g., J.v.411).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A species of coral red insect (kimi), noticeable after rain, are called Indagopakā.  The reason for this name is not clear.  (See Brethren, p.18 n., and N.P.D ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udāna Commentary (p.75, n.12) seems to give Vidojā as an epithet of Indra; but this is probably a wrong reading, the correct one being, as in some MSS., "Visamucchājapam japanti."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inda was a special protector of cows, and when men began to kill these creatures he visited his wrath on them.  Sn.v.310.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indapatta (Indapattana, Indapattha).-&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town in the Kuru country.  In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kurudhamma_jat_276,Kurudhamma Jātaka')"&gt;Kurudhamma Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.ii.365f; also J.iii.400; iv.361; v.457; vi.255; Cyp.i.3, v.1), &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhananjaya,Dhanañjaya Koravya')"&gt;Dhanañjaya Koravya&lt;/a&gt;, is mentioned as its king and as the owner of Añjanavasabha, the elephant of wondrous power.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town was seven leagues in extent (J.v.57; 484) and there was a road that ran straight from Indapatta to Bārānasī (J.v.59).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In times past, Indapatta was considered one of the three chief cities of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;, the others being&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uttarapancaala,Uttarapañcāla')"&gt;Uttarapañcāla&lt;/a&gt; and Kekaka (J.ii.213, 214).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a verse found at the end of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhavamsa,Buddhavamsa')"&gt;Buddhavamsa&lt;/a&gt; (Bu.xxviii.11), the Buddha's razor and needle were enshrined at Indapatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modern Delhi stands on the site of Indapatta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Itivuttaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya, containing 110 suttas, each of which begins with the words: vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dhammapāla (ItA.24ff), the suttas were preached from time to time by the Buddha to Khujjuttarā at Kosambī.  She then repeated them to the five hundred women of Udena's palace, chief of whom was Sāmāvatī.  In order to emphasise to her audience the fact that she was reporting the Buddha's words and not her own, she prefaced each sutta with the phrase quoted above.  There was no need to describe any special circumstances in which the suttas were preached, because they were familiar to Khujjuttarā's audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Rājagaha Council, Ananda repeated the suttas to the Assembly and they were gathered into this collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Itivuttaka is also the name given to one of the nine divisions (anga) into which the Buddha's preaching is divided and it is defined as follows: vuttam h'etam Bhagavatā ti ādinayappavattā dasuttarasatam suttantā Itivuttakam ti veditabbam (DA.i.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the scholiast of the Kummāsapinda Jātaka (J.iii.409; l.21)), the Itivuttaka is mentioned in the plural (Itivuttakesu) and a sutta is quoted from it, extolling the virtues of generosity.  Perhaps, the Itivuttaka was compiled as a result of a critical study of the authentic teachings of the Buddha, considered in a certain light and made for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Issāpakata-itthi Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a woman who, finding that her husband had relations with a female servant, bound the servant hand and foot, cut off her nose and locked her up in a secret chamber.  In order to hide the deed from her husband, she took him to the monastery to hear the Buddha preach.  Some relatives of hers came to the house and discovering what had happened, released the servant.  She went to the monastery where her mistress was listening to the Buddha's sermon and proclaimed aloud the wrong done to her.  The Buddha, thereupon, pointed out the folly of doing evil in the hope that it would not be found out.  We are told that both the woman and her husband became Sotāpanna at the end of the sermon.  The servant was set free (DhA.iii.486-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ilanāga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (A.D.  133-102).  He was the nephew of King Amandagāmani Abhaya.  Ananda was succeeded by his son Cūlābhaya and he by his younger sister Sīvalī.  After Sīvalī had reigned for four months, Ilanaga dethroned her and became king himself.  In the first year of his reign he incurred the displeasure of the powerful Lambakannas and was deprived of his throne and taken captive.  It is said that the king was rescued from prison by his state elephant and that he escaped to Rohana.  Three years later he gave battle to the Lambakannas at Kapallakkhanda and massacred most of them.  He had the noses and toes of the rest cut off as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was succeeded by his son Candamukha Siva.  To his state elephant, who had helped him, he gave the tract of land called Hatthibhoga.  During his exile in Rohana, Ilanaga built two tanks, the Tissa and the Dūra, and restored the Nāgamahāvihāra, which he gave to Mahāpaduma, thera of Tulādhāra, who had preached to him the Kapi Jātaka.  He also gave land for its maintenance.  Mhv.xxxv.14-45; Dpv.xxi.41f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indaka (Sutta)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Indaka&lt;/b&gt;.-A yakkha who lived in Indakūta, near Rājagaha.  When the Buddha was staying at Indakūta, the yakkha questioned him as to how the soul finds its material counterpart.  The Buddha, in reply, described how the embryo evolved into its final shape by the laws of physical growth and not by a soul's fiat (S.i.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.231) that the yakkha was an animist (puggalavādin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Indaka&lt;/b&gt;.-A deva.  He had been a youth who gave a spoonful of food to Anuruddha.  In consequence he was born in Tāvatimsa as a deva of great power and majesty.  When the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa to preach the Abhidhamma, in the assembly of the gods who gathered there, those of lesser powers had to yield place to their superiors.  Thus Ankura (q.v.), who, at the start, was very near the Buddha, found himself twelve leagues away.  But not so Indaka; the power of his merit was very great and no deva was mighty enough to displace him; he had been lucky in the recipient of his gift.  Ankura's generosity, much more lavish than Indaka's, had been bestowed on men who were not holy.  Such was the explanation the Buddha gave in the assembly of the gods, on seeing the discrepancy between the positions of the two devas, Indaka surpassing the other in ten qualities.  (Pv.pp.27f; PvA.136-8; DhA.iii.219-20; 80-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one place, in the Petavatthu (p.28, v.69), Indaka is called a yakkha, but the Commentary (p.139) says it means deva-putta.  He is, therefore, different from Indaka (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indaka Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Contains the question asked by Indaka and the Buddha's reply.  (S.i.206).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ilankiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Damila chieftain of South India, conquered by Parakkamabāhu I.  (Cv.lxxvi.98).  Later, Ilankiya became the ally of Parakkamabāhu, who gave him earrings and other ornaments as a mark of royal favour, also conferring on him the coveted title of Rājavesibhujanga-Silāmegha.  Ibid., 191-2; on the title see Geiger, Cv.  Trs.ii.10, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Issatta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasenadi questions the Buddha as to how gifts should be given and the Buddha's answer is that they should be bestowed where the heart is pleased to give.  The further question is asked as to whom, when given, does a gift bear much fruit.  To the virtuous, irrespective of class, says the Buddha, and he instances the case of a youth skilled in war as opposed to one who is untrained and unskilled, no matter what his social status.  The Buddha proceeds to describe the qualities which are possessed by the virtuous man (S.i.98f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary (SA.i.129f) describes this interview as a public one, taking place before a large audience, among whom are teachers of rival schools, "scratching the ground with their feet." Their fame had suffered owing to the popularity of the Buddha and they had represented him as exhorting the people to give only to himself and to his followers.  Pasenadi here gives the Buddha opportunity to vindicate himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Itthiya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the monks who accompanied Mahinda on his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xii.7; Dpv.xii.12; Sp.i.71; Mbv.116; DhsA.32).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King Sirimeghavanna had an image of Itthiya made and placed beside that of Mahinda and his companions in the vihāra which he built in the south-eastern corner of his palace.  He inaugurated a year's festival in honour of these images (Cv.xxxvii.vv.87ff) (v.l.  Ittiya, Iddhiya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Īsāna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the chief devas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/tevijja_s,Tevijja Sutta')"&gt;Tevijja Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.i.244) he is mentioned with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda,Indra')"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma,Soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna,Varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pajapati,Pajāpati')"&gt;Pajāpati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/brahmaloka,Brahmā')"&gt;Brahmā&lt;/a&gt;, as being invoked by the brahmins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was in the battle of the devas against the Asuras and led a section of the deva host.  Indra tells the devas that if, during the struggle, they felt faint-hearted, they should look at the crest of his own banner or at that of Pajāpati, Varuna or &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/iisaana,Īsāna')"&gt;Īsāna&lt;/a&gt;, and their fear would disappear (S.i.219).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the assembly of the gods, Īsāna gets the fourth seat next to Varuna.  He is in beauty and longevity equal to Indra (SA.i.262).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Īsāna is an older name for Rudra (Siva) (Böthlinck and Roth: Wörterbuch).  The conception of him had so far changed by the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; that in Buddhaghosa's accounts he is given a seat near&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; and inferior to his.  Perhaps he was one of the thirty-three gods of&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt; (KS.i.281, n.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Questions are asked as to what makes for lordship among men, what is the supreme commodity, etc., and the answer is that power of command it is which brings lordship and that women are the supreme commodity, etc.  S.i.43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Indriya Sutta.-Where control of the faculties of sense (indriya) is not found, morality ceases to exist and, in consequence, concentration, insight into and knowledge of reality as it is, detachment and the feeling of revulsion, insight into liberation - these also cease to exist.  When such control is present all the other qualities are also present.  A.iii.360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Indriya Sutta.-If a monk, observing the rise and fall in the faculties of sense, is repelled by them and lusts not for them, the knowledge arises in him that he is free and that for him there is no hereafter.  Thus would he be perfect in faculty.  S.iv.140.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), are called the Path that goes to the Uncompounded (asankhata).  S.iv.361.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Indriya Sutta.-The five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), when practised with singleness of heart, dispassion, and cessation that conduces to abandonment, form the Path leading to the Uncompounded.  S.iv.365.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Indriya Sutta.-Anuruddha tells his colleagues that by cultivating the four satipatthānas, he knows, as they really are, the nature of the minds of other beings, of other persons (indriyaparopariyatti).  S.v.305.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Itthakāvati&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A village in Magadha, mentioned, together with Dīgharājī, as the residence of the Samsāramocaka heretics.  Near by was the Ārunavatīvihāra, where Sāriputta once stayed with a company of monks.  The village had retained its name for five hundred years (PvA.67).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Petavatthu (pp.12-13) contains the story of a woman of Itthakāvati who was born as a peta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indasālaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave, the size of a bed in a monk's cell, near Vallipāsāna Vihāra.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the residence of Mahā-Nāgasena Thera.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was ill, eight thousand arahants and the inhabitants of the two deva worlds, led by Sakka, came to look after him.  They all found room in the cave.  MT.552.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isipatana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Isipatana.&lt;/b&gt;-An open space near &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/baranasi,Benares')"&gt;Benares&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the famous Migadāya or Deer Park.  It was eighteen leagues from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/uruvelaa,Uruvelā')"&gt;Uruvelā&lt;/a&gt;, and when &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gotama,Gotama')"&gt;Gotama&lt;/a&gt; gave up his austere penances his friends, the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pancavaggiya,Pañcavaggiya')"&gt;Pañcavaggiya&lt;/a&gt; monks, left him and went to Isipatana (J.i.68).  After his Enlightenment the Buddha, leaving Uruvela, joined them in Isipatana, and it was there that he preached his first sermon, the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammacakkappavattana,Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta')"&gt;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&lt;/a&gt;, on the full-moon day of Āsālha.  Vin.i.10f.; on this occasion 80 kotis of Brahmas and innumerable gods attained the comprehension of the Truth (Mil.30); (130 kotis says Mil.350).  The Lal.  (528) gives details of the stages of this journey.  The Buddha, having no money with which to pay the ferryman, crossed the Ganges through the air.  When &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt; heard of this, he abolished the toll for ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, also, the Buddha spent his first rainy season (BuA., p.3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Buddhas preach their first sermon at the Migadāya in Isipatana; it is one of the four avijahitatthānāni (unchanging spots), the others being the bodhi-pallanka, the spot at the gate of Sankassa, where the Buddha first touches the earth on his return from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/taavatimsa,Tāvatimsa')"&gt;Tāvatimsa&lt;/a&gt;, and the site of the bed in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhakuti,Gandhakuti')"&gt;Gandhakuti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jetavana,Jetavana')"&gt;Jetavana&lt;/a&gt; (BuA.247; DA.ii.424).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of pilgrimage which his devout followers should visit (D.ii.141).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana was so-called because sages, on their way through the air (from the Himalayas), alight here or start from here on their aerial flight (isayo ettha nipatanti uppatanti cāti-Isipatanam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Migadāya was so-called because deer were allowed to roam about there unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacceka Buddhas, having spent seven days in contemplation in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhamaadana,Gandhamādana')"&gt;Gandhamādana&lt;/a&gt;, bathe in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/anotatta,Anotatta')"&gt;Anotatta&lt;/a&gt; Lake and come to the habitations of men through the air, in search of alms.  They descend to earth at Isipatana (MA.i.387; AA.i.347 adds that sages also held the uposatha at Isipatana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the Pacceka Buddhas come to Isipatana from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nandamulapabbhara,Nandamūlaka-pabbhāra')"&gt;Nandamūlaka-pabbhāra&lt;/a&gt; (MA.ii.1019; PsA.437-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other incidents connected with the Buddha, besides the preaching of the first sermon, are mentioned as having taken place in Isipatana.  Here it was that one day at dawn &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/y/yasa,Yasa')"&gt;Yasa&lt;/a&gt; came to the Buddha and became an arahant (Vin.i.15f).  It was at Isipatana, too, that the rule was passed prohibiting the use of sandals made of talipot leaves (Vin.i.189).  On another occasion when the Buddha was staying at Isipatana, having gone there from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;, he instituted rules forbidding the use of certain kinds of flesh, including human flesh (Vin.i.216ff.; the rule regarding human flesh was necessary because &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suppiyaa,Suppiyā')"&gt;Suppiyā&lt;/a&gt; made broth out of her own flesh for a sick monk).  Twice, while the Buddha was at Isipatana, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maara,Māra')"&gt;Māra&lt;/a&gt; visited him but had to go away discomfited (S.i.105f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta mentioned above, several other suttas were preached by the Buddha while staying at Isipatana, among them &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Pañca Sutta (S.iii.66f), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Rathakāra or Pacetana Sutta (A.i.110f), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the two Pāsa Suttas (S.i.105f), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Samaya Sutta (A.iii.320ff), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Katuviya Sutta (A.i.279f.), &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a discourse on the Metteyyapañha of the Parāyana (A.iii.399f), and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Dhammadinna Sutta (S.v.406f), preached to the distinguished layman &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhammadinna,Dhammadinna')"&gt;Dhammadinna&lt;/a&gt;, who came to see the Buddha.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most eminent members of the Sangha seem to have resided at Isipatana from time to time; among recorded conversations at Isipatana are several between &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kotthita,Mahākotthita')"&gt;Mahākotthita&lt;/a&gt; (S.ii.112f;iii.167f;iv.162f; 384ff), and one between Mahākotthita and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta,Citta-Hatthisāriputta')"&gt;Citta-Hatthisāriputta&lt;/a&gt; (A.iii.392f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made, too, of a discourse in which several monks staying at Isipatana tried to help &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/channa,Channa')"&gt;Channa&lt;/a&gt; in his difficulties (S.iii.132f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavamsa,Mahāvamsa')"&gt;Mahāvamsa&lt;/a&gt;, there was a large community of monks at Isipatana in the second century B.C.  For, we are told that at the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura, twelve thousand monks were present from Isipatana led by the Elder Dhammasena (Mhv.xxix.31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt; (Beal: Records of the Western World, ii.45ff ) found, at Isipatana, fifteen hundred monks studying the Hīnayāna.  In the enclosure of the Sanghārāma was a vihāra about two hundred feet high, strongly built, its roof surmounted by a golden figure of the mango.  In the centre of the vihāra was a life-size statue of the Buddha turning the wheel of the Law.  To the south-west were the remains of a stone stupa built by &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/asoka,Asoka')"&gt;Asoka&lt;/a&gt;.  The Divy.  (389-94) mentions Asoka as intimating to Upagupta his desire to visit the places connected with the Buddha's activities, and to erect thupas there.  Thus he visited Lumbinī, Bodhimūla, Isipatana, Migadāya and Kusinagara; this is confirmed by Asoka's lithic records, e.g.  Rock Edict, viii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of it was a stone pillar to mark the spot where the Buddha preached his first sermon.  Near by was another stupa on the site where the Pañcavaggiyas spent their time in meditation before the Buddha's arrival, and another where five hundred Pacceka Buddhas entered Nibbāna.  Close to it was another building where the future Buddha Metteyya received assurance of his becoming a Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiouen Thsang quotes the Nigrodhamiga Jātaka (J.i.145ff) to account for the origin of the Migadāya.  According to him the Deer Park was the forest gifted by the king of Benares of the Jātaka, where the deer might wander unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Udapāna Jātaka (J.ii.354ff ) there was a very ancient well near Isipatana which, in the Buddha's time, was used by the monks living there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past ages Isipatana sometimes retained its own name, E.g., in the time of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.18), Dhammadassī (BuA.182) and Kassapa (BuA.218).  Kassapa was born there (ibid., 217).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more often Isipatana was known by different names (for these names see under those of the different Buddhas).  Thus in Vipassī's time it was known as Khema-uyyāna.  It is the custom for all Buddhas to go through the air to Isipatana to preach their first sermon.  Gotama, however, walked all the way, eighteen leagues, because he knew that by so doing he would meet Upaka, the Ajivaka, to whom he could be of service (DA.ii.471).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isipatana is identified with the modern Saranath, six miles from Benares.  Cunningham (Arch.  Reports, i.  p.  107) found the Migadāya represented by a fine wood, covering an area of about half a mile, extending from the great tomb of Dhammek on the north to the Chaukundi mound on the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Isipatana.&lt;/b&gt;-A monastery built by Parakkamabāhu I.  in the suburb Rājavesibhujanga, of Pulatthipura.  Cv.lxxviii.79; but see lxxiii.151-5 and Cv.  Trs.ii.18, n.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iccānanagala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin village in the Kosala country.  It was while staying in the woodland thicket (vanasanda) there that the Buddha preached the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.87).  From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasādi's domain of Ukkatthā.  It was the residence of "Mahāsāla" brahmins.  The Sutta Nipāta (p.115) (which spells the name as Icchānankala) mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among them Cankī, Tārukkha, Pokkarasāti, Jānussoni and Todeyya.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also two learned youths, Vāsettha and Bharadvāja at Icchānankala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village.  Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the Vāsettha Sutta (Ibid., 115ff.; M ii.146ff).  Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.462) says that learned brahmins of Kosala, deeply versed in the Vedas, were in the habit of meeting together from time to time (once in six months, MA.ii.796) at Icchānangala in order to recite the Vedas and discuss their interpretation.  These brahmins met at Ukkatthā, under Pokkharasāti, when they wished to cleanse their caste (jātisodhanattham), and at Icchānankala in order to revise their Vedic hymns (mante sodhetu-kāmā), MA.ii.796.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikāya (v.325), the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānangala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food.  But from the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.30f.; cf.  iii.341 and iv.340ff), it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānangala, having heard of the Buddha's visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts.  The Buddha had to send Nāgita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of his admirers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isimuggadāyaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Thera.  He gave isimugga mixed with honey to Padumuttara Buddha and 108,000 monks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, forty-four kappas ago he was born thirty-eight times as king, his name being Mahisamanta.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Illisa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A setthi of Rājagaha.  At the opening of the story the king of Benares is mentioned, but it is to Rājagaha that Sakka comes (see p.350), so Rājagaha was evidently Illisa's residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was lame and hunch-backed and also had a squint.  He was an infidel and a miser, never giving away any of his wealth nor enjoying it himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seven generations his ancestors had been generous, but Illisa burnt down the almonry and drove away the poor from his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, at the sight of a yokel drinking, with a piece of dried fish as a relish, Illisa was sorely tempted to drink himself.  For a long time he fought the temptation, but he sickened with longing, and having sent a slave with a single penny to the tavern, he got some toddy; he ordered the slave to put the jar of spirits in a thicket by the riverside so that he might drink unseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Illisa's father, who had been born as Sakka, having learnt, as a result of investigations, that his son had become a miser, came down to earth to wean him from his folly.  Assuming in every detail the form of Illisa, he entered the king's palace and offered all the wealth of Illisa to the king.  On the offer being refused, he went to Illisa's house and gave orders to the servants to throw open all the treasure chambers and give the wealth to the poor.  The servants took the disguised Sakka to be Illisa himself, and Illisa's wife, believing her husband's sudden generosity to be due to his drunkenness, acquiesced in the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who profited by this unexpected good fortune was a countryman who had been Illisa's carriage-driver.  Filling the carriage with seven things of value, he set out along the road, passing by the thicket wherein Illisa lay drinking.  The man was singing Illisa's praises, and at mention of his name Illisa came out, and seeing the man going away with his belongings tried to stop him.  But the man, not recognising him, knocked him down and went on his way.  Illisa hurried home but was turned out of his house by the porters, and at length he sought the king.  The king, having heard his story, made enquiries and discovered the existence of two Illisas, alike in every respect, down to the minutest detail, even to a wart on the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not even Illisa's wife and children, not even his barber, could distinguish him from the second Illisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bereft of all hope, Illisa swoons, Sakka reveals himself and tells Illisa that the wealth is really his and not Illisa's, the latter not having earned it.  He urges Illisa to do good and practise generosity, or he would die, smitten by Indra's thunderbolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illisa, taking heed of the warning, becomes a virtuous man (J.i.349ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isidatta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera.  He was the son of a caravan guide at Vaddhagāma (v.l.  Velugāma) in Avanti.  By correspondence he became the unseen friend of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/citta,Citta-gahapati')"&gt;Citta-gahapati&lt;/a&gt; of Macchikāsanda.  The latter once sent him a letter regarding the excellences of the Buddha, and Isidatta, being pleased with the account given of the Buddha's religion, entered the Order under &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kaccaana,Mahā-Kaccāna')"&gt;Mahā-Kaccāna&lt;/a&gt; and in due course became an arahant.  Later, with Mahā-Kaccāna's leave, he visited the Buddha in the Majjhimadesa and was warmly received by him (ThagA.i.238).  A verse uttered by Isidatta, in response to the Buddha's enquiry regarding his welfare, is recorded in the Therāgāthā (v.120).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta had been a householder in the time of Vipassī Buddha and once, having seen the Buddha walking along the street and being pleased with his demeanour, he gave him an āmoda-fruit (ThagA.  loc.  cit.).  He is, probably, identical with Amodapaliya of the Apadāna (ii.447).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.283-8, also AA.i.210), Isidatta was once staying with a number of senior monks at Macchikāsanda in the Ambātaka grove.  Citta-gahapati invited the monks to a meal.  On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha's teaching on the diversity of the elements.  The chief Elder, being unable to answer, remained silent.  Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, obtained the chief Elder's permission, and answered the question to the satisfaction of Citta.  Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, such as the infinity of the world, etc.  At the end of the discourse, Citta discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other than his unseen friend, Isidatta.  Delighted with the discovery, he invited Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchikāsanda, promising to provide him with all requisites.  But that same day Isidatta left Macchikāsanda and never returned.  Because, says Buddhaghosa (AA.i.210), he did not wish to stay after having been recognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-An equerry or chamberlain (thapati) of Pasenadi, King of Kosala.  Isidatta is always mentioned with Purāna.  Their duty was to look after the ladies of the king's harem when these went riding the elephant into the park.  This often brought them into close contact with the ladies, and they confessed to the Buddha that it was difficult not to have evil thoughts regarding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta and Purāna were once at Sādhuka' on some business (their own property, according to Buddhaghosa, SA.i.215).  They heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and they waited for an opportunity to talk to him.  When the opportunity came they followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them and how sad when he was away on tour.  The Buddha preaches to them the glory of the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy.  He speaks very appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods with holy men, a rare quality (S.v.348-52; Netti.  134f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Samyutta Commentary (i.215), Isidatta was a Sakadāgāmī and Purāna a Sotāpanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dhammacetiya Sutta (M.ii.123f), Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and Purāna show for the Buddha and his teachings.  "They are my carriage-builders," says the king, "and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the king spent the night in a cramped little house.  Isidatta and Purāna, who were with him, having spent the best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their heads in the direction in which they thought the Buddha to be, and their feet towards the king!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta was the uncle of the woman-disciple Migasālā, whose father was Purāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purāna is described as a brahmacāri, but not Isidatta, yet, after death, they were both born in Tusita.  Migasālā asks Ananda how it was that people of different characters could have the same rebirth.  A.iii.348f.; v.138f., 143f.  From MA.ii.756, it would appear as if Isidatta was the brahmacāri.  The word cannot here mean "celibate," for Purāna must have had a wife because Migasālā calls him her father (pitā).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isidatta is mentioned by the Buddha among those who had the six qualities that brought realisation of immortality - unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, Ariyan virtue, wisdom and liberation (A.iii.451).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anāgata Vamsa (v.58) says that when the future Buddha Metteyya leaves the household life, eighty-four thousand others, led by Isidatta and Purāna, will accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-King of Soreyya.  Anomadassī Buddha preached to him and to eighty thousand of his followers.  They all became arahants.  BuA.143-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Isidatta.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the three leaders of the monks in Ceylon during the time that Brāhmanatissa-cora laid waste the land.  The other two were Cūlasīva and Mahāsona.  For the story connected with them see s.v.  Mahāsona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indriyabhāvanā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Kajangalā in the Mukheluvana.  When a young brahmin, Uttara, pupil of Pārāpariya, visits the Buddha, the Buddha asks him what was the teaching of Pārāsariya on the development of the indriyas.  It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes, nor hear words with his ears, says Uttara.  Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development.  When Uttara sits silent and discomfited, Ananda intervenes and begs the Buddha to expound his teaching on the subject.  The Buddha agrees and preaches this sutta, with a variety of similes (M.iii.298-302).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Theragāthā Commentary (ii.17) we are told that the thera Pārāpariya (probably identical with Pārāsariya mentioned above) was taught the Indriyabhāvana Sutta by the Buddha.  He learnt it by heart, and pondering over its meaning, attained insight.  The Theragāthā (vv.726ff) gives a summary of the musings of Pārāpariya which lead to his attainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only connection between the Sutta and this summary is identity of subject, not identity of treatment.  Perhaps Pārāpariya's musings were only prompted by the sutta and were independent of its actual words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Irandatī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nāga maiden, daughter of the Nāga King, Varuna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she learned that her mother, Vimalā, longed for the heart of Vidhura, she determined to get for herself a husband who would satisfy her mother's craving.  So she went to the Himālaya and having spread a bed of fragrant flowers, lay thereon and sang.  Vessavana's nephew, a yakkha, Punnaka, heard her and offered himself as her husband.  She took him to her father who agreed to give him Irandatī, if he could bring Vidhura's heart.  When Punnaka fulfilled this condition, as described in the Vidhura-pandita Jātaka, Irandatī became his wife.  J.vi.263-327.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indriya Jātaka (No.  423)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an ascetic named Nārada, younger brother of Kāladevala, became a disciple of the Bodhisatta Jotipāla (also called in the story Sarabhanga), and lived in the mountainous country of Arañjara.  Near Nārada's hermitage was a river, on the banks of which courtesans used to sit, tempting men.  Nārada saw one of these courtesans, and becoming enamoured of her, forsook his meditations and pined away for lack of food.  Kāladevala, being aware of this, tried to wean him from his desires.  Nārada, however, refused to be comforted, even when his colleagues, Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara admonished him.  In the end Sarabhanga himself was summoned and Nārada, having listened to the words of his Master, was persuaded to give up his passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a backsliding monk.  He went about for alms with his teachers and instructors but, being their junior, he received very little attention.  Dissatisfied with his food and treatment, he sought his wife of former days.  She provided him with every comfort and gradually tempted him with the desire to become a householder again.  When the monk's fellow-celibates discovered his wish, they took him to the Buddha who preached to him this Jātaka, showing that in a past life, too, he had been sorely tempted by the same woman.  Nārada was identified with the backsliding monk and the courtesan with the wife of his lay-days (J.iii.461-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is stated on this occasion to have preached also the Kandina Jātaka (J.i.153ff), the Rādha Jātaka (J.i.495ff), the Ruhaka Jātaka (J.ii.113ff), the Kanavera Jātaka (J.iii.58ff), the Asanka Jātaka (J.iii.248ff) and the Alambusā Jātaka (J.v.152ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indriya Jātaka is also referred to in the Kāmavilāpa Jātaka (J.ii.443ff), but the connection between the two stories is not clear; perhaps the reference is to another story of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also Sarabhanga Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indasamānagotta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hermit who lived, with a large number of other anchorites, in the Himālaya.  He had a young elephant which he had reared; being headstrong and rough in speech, he would not listen to the warning of his teacher, the Bodhisatta, that it was dangerous to have such a pet.  Once while the hermits were away the elephant was seized with a frenzy, and when his master returned it killed him (J.ii.41-3).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the man's name was Kosiya, because we are told (J.vi.501) that Inda was of the Kosiyagotta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kātiyāna, who was a brahmin of the Kosiyagotta (ThagA.i.450), is addressed in a verse (416) of the Theragāthā as Indasagotta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Issarasamanārāma (Issarasamanavāhara, Issarasamanaka)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the monasteries at Anurādhapura.  It was built by Devānampiyatissa on the spot where the prince Arittha dwelt with his five hundred followers after having received their ordination from Mahinda (Mhv.xx.14; xix.66).  The building of this monastery was the seventh of the great tasks performed by Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xx.20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eight saplings from the Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted at Issarasamanārāma (Mhv.xix.61; Mbv.162).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candamukha Siva built a tank near Manikāragāmaka and gave it for the use of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxv.47), while Vasabha built in the monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxv.87) and Vohāraka Tissa constructed a wall round it (Mhv.xxxvi.36).  Kassapa I.  restored the buildings and enlarged the grounds.  He also bought villages which he presented to the monastery for its maintenance.  He had two daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā, and he gave their names and his own to the vihāra.  When the king wished to hand over the vihāra to the Theravāda monks they refused to accept it, fearing the reproach of the people that it was the work of a parricide.  Then the king dedicated it to the image of the Buddha and the monks accepted it saying that it belonged to their Master (Cv.xxxix.10-14; see also below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (pp.  407 and 652), the vihāra was also called Kassapagiri, probably after its restoration by Kassapa I., mentioned above.' See also Kassapagiri.  See also Cv.  Trs.i.43, n.7, and Ep.  Zeyl.  i.31ff., where the vihāra is called "Isuramenu-.Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri" in an inscription of Mahinda IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had originally been called Issarasamana because of its association with the five hundred noblemen (issaradārakā) who joined the Order with Arittha (MT.416).  The Tīkā adds (607) that Sāliya, son of Dutthagāmani, enlarged the vihāra out of the tribute brought to him by the men of his tributary villages to the south of Anurādhapura.  He used to observe the uposatha on fast days at the vihāra and spend the day in the Mahindaguhā there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Samantapāsādikā (i.100) the vihāra is called Issaranimmāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iddhipāda Sutta/Vagga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iddhipāda Vagga.&lt;/b&gt;-The ninth chapter of the Navaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iv.463-4).  It consists of ten suttas dealing with the cultivation of the four iddhi-pādas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Iddhipāda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The cultivation of the four iddhipādas and of exertion (ussolhi) brings insight (aññā) in this life, or the Third Fruit of the Path.  A.iii.81-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Iddhipāda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The Buddha, even as Bodhisatta, before the Enlightenment, developed the four iddhipādas and exertion, and as a result enjoyed great psychic power.  A.iii.82-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Iddhipāda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The four iddhipādas form the path leading to the Uncompounded (asankhata).  S.iv.360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Iddhipāda Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The path mentioned above should be practised, accompanied by concentration and effort, compounded with desire, energy, idea and investigation.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Illisa Jātaka (No.  78)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/illisa,Illisa')"&gt;Illisa&lt;/a&gt;.  The Jātaka was related in reference to the conversion by Moggallāna of the banker Maccharikosiya (q.v.) of Sakkhara.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illisa of the past is identified with Macchariyakosiya (J.i.345ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given as an example of iddhi by means of which Moggallāna made a little thing increase manyfold.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indasālaguhā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cave on the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vediya,Vediya')"&gt;Vediya&lt;/a&gt; mountain, to the north of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ambasandaa,Ambasandā')"&gt;Ambasandā&lt;/a&gt;, which was a brahmin village, east of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/raajagaha,Rājagaha')"&gt;Rājagaha&lt;/a&gt;.  Once, when the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; was staying there, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakka,Sakka')"&gt;Sakka&lt;/a&gt; visited him and asked him the questions recorded in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha Sutta')"&gt;Sakkapañha Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; says (DA.iii.697) that the cave lay between two overhanging rocks, with a large sāla-tree at the entrance.  The village community had added walls with doors and windows and had ornamented it with polished plaster scroll-work and garlands and had presented it to the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Fa Hsien's time (Giles, 48f), it was still inhabited and he describes it as being one yojana north-east of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naalandaa,Nālandā')"&gt;Nālandā&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/h/hiuen_tsang,Hiouen Thsang')"&gt;Hiouen Thsang&lt;/a&gt;, however, found it deserted.  He calls it Indraka-saila-gūhā (Beal ii.180-1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both pilgrims noticed marks on the rock; according to Fa Hsien they were the answers to Sakka's questions written by the Buddha with his finger, while Hiouen Thsang says that both questions and answers were written on the stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cave is identified with one about two miles to the south-west of the modern village of Giriyek.  (CAGI.  539ff; Stein, Ind.  Antiq.  1901, p.54).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that on the occasion of the preaching of the Sakkapañha Sutta, eight hundred million devas realised the Truth (Mil.349).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somanassa,Somanassa')"&gt;Somanassa&lt;/a&gt; (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Īsadhara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the seven ranges of mountains round Sineru It is the abode of deva kings and of devas and yakkhas (SnA.ii.443; Sp.i.119; Dvy.217).  It is higher than Karavīka, and between these two is a Sīdantara-samudda; next to Īsadhara and higher than it is Yugandhara, and between them is another Sidantara-samudda (J.vi.125).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvastu (ii.300) calls it Isāndhara (suggesting its probable etymology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Iddhi Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Iddhi Sutta&lt;/b&gt;.-Anuruddha tells the monks that by cultivating the four satipatthānas, he enjoys psychic power in many ways, such as multiplying himself.  He can reach even to the Brahma world.  S.v.303.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Iddhi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt;-Same as above, but the psychic power is that of the divine power of hearing all things, far and near.  S.v.304.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indriyagocara Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentioned in the Atthasālinī (pp.  307-8), Buddhaghosa's Commentary on the Dhammasangani.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quotation given from it is: "ekam mahābhūtam upādāya pāsādo pathavidhātuyā tīhi mahābhūtehi susangahito āpodhātuyā ca tejodhātuyā ca vāyodhātuyā ca." The sutta has, so far, not been traced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isayo Araññakā (or Gandha) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago, many seers of virtuous conduct lived in leaf huts in a wild forest.  According to Buddhaghosa, they lived in the Himālays (SA.i.265); Vepacitti and Sakka were father- and son-in-law; sometimes they quarrelled, sometimes, as here, they were friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Sakka and Vepacitti visited them.  Vepacitti entered the hermitage by the principal gate, keeping his shoes on and his sword by his side, thereby insulting the seers and committing sin.  Sakka, on the other hand, went in by the usual entrance, doffing his shoes and sword; with his canopy folded up, he stood to leeward of the seers, rendering them homage with clasped hands.  The seers, addressing Sakka, asked him if he did not feel disgust at their smell, inasmuch as they were humans and he a god.  Sakka answered that the scent of virtuous men is lovely, like unto a wreath of varied blossoms (S.i.226).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isidāsī Therī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the daughter of a good and wealthy merchant of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/u/ujjenii,Ujjenī')"&gt;Ujjenī&lt;/a&gt;.  Having come of age, she was given in marriage to the son of a merchant in Sāketa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one month she lived with him as a devoted wife; then because of her past kamma, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her out of the house.  She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar.  Isidāsī's father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim's life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more.  Isidāsī then met the therī&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/j,Jinadattā')"&gt;Jinadattā&lt;/a&gt;, whom she entertained to a meal at her house.  Under Jinadattā, Isidāsī joined the Order and became an arahant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Therīgāthā (vv.400-47), which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives.  She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life.  As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter's daughter.  In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father's debts.  When she was sixteen, the merchant's son, Giridāsa, fell in love with her and married her.  He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband.  Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands.  This account of her sojourn in samsāra was related by Isidāsī in response to a request by one of her fellow-nuns, Bodhī (ThigA.260ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs.  Rhys Davids thinks (Sisters, Introd.  pp.xxii f) that Isidāsī's verses in the Therīgāthā suggest late literary craft and bear the impress of late literary creation.  The scene is Pātaliputta, and not any of the usual towns mentioned in the Canon, and the name of Isidāsī's sponsor - Jindattā - is, she says, significant.  Perhaps there are traces here of Jainistic influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Dīpavamsa (xviii.9) Isidāsī (Isidāsikā) is mentioned in a list of eminent therīs who were leaders of the Order of bhikkhunis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isidinna&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thera.  He was the son of a setthi in Sunāparanta.  He witnessed the miracle of the Buddha's acceptance of the Candana-mālā (probably the Candanamālaka), and, having heard the Buddha preach, he became a Sotāpanna.  While still living the life of a householder, a compassionate spirit urged him to give it up.  He entered the Order and soon after became an arahant (ThagA.i.312-3).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Theragāthās (vv.187-8) contains two verses which he uttered in confessing aññā.  They were the same as were spoken to him by his friendly spirit.  In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder and did homage to the Buddha's Bodhi-tree with a fan made of sumana-flowers (ThagA.312f).  He is probably identical with Sumanavājaniya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.415).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isayo Samuddakā (or Sambara) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago, many virtuous seers lived in huts on the seashore.  At that time there was a war between the gods and the Asuras.  The seers considered the gods righteous but feared harm from the Asuras.  They went, therefore, to Sambara, lord of the Asuras, and asked him for a pledge of safety; he refused, saying that the seers were followers of Sakka.  The seers thereupon cursed him to suffer everlasting terror.  It is said that that same night Sambara woke up thrice, seized with fright (S.i.227-8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa (SA.i.266) adds that as a result of this curse, Sambara's mind became deranged and he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isigili&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the five mountains round Rājagaha and one of the beauty-spots of the city (D.ii.116).  There was, on one side of it, a black stone called the Kālasilā.  This was a favourite haunt of the Buddha and the members of the Order.  See e.g., Viii.ii.76, where Dabba Mallaputta is asked by monks to provide for them accommodation there; see also Vin.iii.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also the scene of the suicide of Godhika and Vakkali (S.i.121; iii.121f) and of the murder of Moggallāna by the brigands (J.v.125f; DhA.iii.65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Cūla Dukkhakkhanda Sutta it is said that a large number of Niganthas lived at Kālasilā, never sitting down, undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony, following the teachings of Nigantha Nātaputta.  The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahānāma (M.i.91ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kālasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ananda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ananda did not take his opportunity (D.iii.116).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books refer to several other visits of the Buddha to Isigilapassa.  During one of these visits he heard Vangīsa's high eulogy of Moggallāna (S.i.194; Thag.1249ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68-71) the Buddha is represented as saying that while the other mountains round Rājagaha - Vebhāra, Pandava, Vepulla and Gijjhakūta - had changed their old names, Isigili retained its former name and designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hundred Pacceka Buddhas once resided in Isigili for a long time; they could be seen entering the mountain, but once entered, there was no more sign of them.  Men, observing this, said that the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (Isī gilatī ti = Isigili).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa adds (MA.ii.889) that when the Pacceka Buddhas returned from their begging rounds, the rock would open like a folding door to admit them.  Within the rock they had made for themselves cloisters, dwelling-houses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Idhalokika Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two suttas preached by the Buddha to Visākhā at the Migāramātupāsāda.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve victory in this world a woman should have four qualities: she should efficiently discharge her duties as housewife, should win the esteem of her servants and the affection of her husband and should look after his wealth.  For victory in the next world, she should be possessed of faith, virtue, generosity and wisdom.  A.iv.269ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Icchānangala Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached to the monks at Icchānangala at the end of the three months' solitude referred to above.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should anyone ask the monks how the Buddha spent his time during the rainy season, they should reply that he spent it in intense concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing.  A life spent by anyone in such concentration would be a life spent according to the Ariyan way and would lead to the destruction of the āsavas (S.v.325f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isigili Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 116th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya (M.iii.68ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached to the monks at Isigili.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It explains how Isigili came by its name, and gives a list of the Pacceka Buddhas who once dwelt there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Isidatta Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Isidatta Sutta.-Records the questions of Citta-gahapati and the answers given by Isidatta Thera on the diversity of the elements.  S.iv.283-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Isidatta Sutta.-The same, on the various views that arise in the world.  Isidatta answers that they are all due to sakkāyaditthi; he then proceeds, in reply to further questions, to explain how sakkāyaditthi arises and how its absence is brought about.  S.iv.286-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Icchānangalaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An upāsaka of Icchānangala.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a devoted disciple of the Buddha and had been in the habit of visiting him often (UdA.115).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he visited the Buddha at Jetavana after a long interval, and on being asked why he had been absent so long, he replied that he had been kept busy by various duties.  Thereupon the Buddha sang the joy of the life free from ties.  Ud., p.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Itthā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Itthā Sutta.-Preached to Anāthapindika on five things in the world which are very desirable but are difficult to attain - longevity, beauty, happiness, fame, happy rebirth - and on the means of obtaining them (A.iii.47-9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Itthā Sutta.-The ten desirable things in the world, the obstacles to their attainment and the methods of procuring them (A.v.135f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indagutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Indagutta.&lt;/b&gt;-A thera.  He superintended the construction of the Mahāthūpa at Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxviii.98; Dpv.xix.5, 6, 8).  Dutthagāmanī consulted him with regard to all details and appointed him kammādhitthāyaka from the commencement of the work (MT.550f).  He had great psychic powers, and at the festival of the dedication of the Thūpa he created a parasol of copper, as great as the universe, to ward off any harm that might befall those taking part in the celebrations (Mhv.xxxi.85).  He was at the side of the king throughout the festival (Mhv.xxxi.105), and, by virtue of his power, all the inhabitants of Ceylon, who wished to worship the relics at the Mahāthūpa, were enabled to go to Anurādhapura the moment the wish to do so entered their hearts, and to return the same day (Mhv.xxxi.115).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Indagutta is probably to be identified with the thera Indagutta, the head of a great parivena in Rājagaha, who came to Ceylon with eighty thousand monks to be present at the foundation-ceremony of the Mahāthūpa (Mhv.xxix.30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Indagutta.&lt;/b&gt;-The thera appointed by the monks of Pātaliputta to superintend the work of building the eighty-four thousand vihāras undertaken by Asoka.  The thera, by his power, made it possible for the dedication festivals of all the vihāras to be performed on the same day.  Mhv.v.174; Sp.i.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indagutta originally lived in Sīhakumbha-vihāra in Devaputta, at the head of a large congregation.  Asoka, having heard of his fame, invited him to Pātaliputta.  He went with 60,000 monks and Asoka received them with great honour.  At the sight of the honours paid to him Indagutta was filled with pride.  Asoka noticing this, admonished him.  Indagutta benefiting by the advice, developed insight even as he stood and became an arahant.  Ras.i.80f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yāgudāyaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Thirty thousand kappas ago, while on his way home laden with gifts, he found the river impassable and took his evening meal at a monastery.  There he was pleased with the demeanour of the monks and gave them a meal of gruel with five savouries (? pañcanna yāgu).  After death, he was born in Tāvatimsa, and was king of gods thirty three times and king of men thirty times.  Ap.ii.375f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yamunā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yamunā.  &lt;/b&gt; The second of the five great rivers of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jambudiipa,Jambudīpa')"&gt;Jambudīpa&lt;/a&gt;, which are often used in similes.

For its origin see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gangaa,Gangā')"&gt;Gangā&lt;/a&gt;.  It is stated in the story of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bakkula,Bakkula')"&gt;Bakkula&lt;/a&gt; (ThagA.i.344) that newly born children were bathed in the waters of the Yamunā for their health.  The river was evidently the special resort of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/naaga,Nāgas')"&gt;Nāgas&lt;/a&gt; (See, e.g., D.ii.259; J.vi.158, 161ff., 164, 197).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that the fish of the Yamunā considered themselves more beautiful than those of the Gangā.  J.ii.151ff.  under the river was the realm of the Nāga king, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/d/dhatarattha,Dhatarattha')"&gt;Dhatarattha&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.200).  The waters of the Gangā mix very easily with those of the Yamunā (J.v.496; vi.  412, 415).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yamunā.  &lt;/b&gt; A channel branching off westward from the Punnavaddhana Tank.  Cv.lxxix.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

There are other “sacrifices” which harm no one and by which the celebrants are blessed and the gods pleased.  S.i.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Yodha Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Three qualities which make a soldier serviceable to a king: he must be a long distance shot, a rapid (like lightning) shot, and a piercer of huge objects; and three similar qualities (details of which are given) which make a monk worthy of homage and gifts.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasoja (v.l.  Yasojoti) Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born outside the gates of Sāvatthi in a fishing village, where his father was the headman of five hundred families.  When he came of age, he was fishing one day in the Aciravatī, and, casting his net, caught a large golden colour fish.  Yasoja and his companions took the fish to Pasenadi who sent them to the Buddha.  The Buddha told them that the fish had been a wicked monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha, and had since suffered in purgatory, where his mother and sisters still were.  He then preached to them the Kapila Sutta, and Yasoja and his companions, greatly moved, renounced the world (ThagA.i.356f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Udāna mentions (Ud.iii.3) how, later, Yasoja and five hundred of his companions went to see the Buddha at Jetavana.  There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar.  The Buddha, sending Ananda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen.  Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumudā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha.  During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship.  Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Amanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them.  Ananda sent a message.  When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night.  Amanda could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation.  It is said in UdA.185 that the Buddha spent the night in samādhi in order to show Yasoja and his companions that he regarded them as equals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (ThagA.i.357) that when Yasoja and the others visited the Buddha at Vesāli, they were very thin and had grown uncomely through their austerities.  The Buddha commended their self denial in a verse, and Yasoja, appreciating the Buddha's praise, uttered two other verses, exalting the love of solitude (Thag.243 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha Yasoja belonged to a family of park-keepers (ārāmagopakā), and one day seeing the Buddha travel through the air, he gave him a labuja fruit (ThagA.i.356).  In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Yasoja was the leader of a band of five hundred robbers.  They were pursued by the villagers and fled into the forest for safety.  There they saw a monk sitting on a stone and asked him for protection.  He advised them to take the five precepts, and when they had done so, he exhorted them never to violate these precepts even if keeping them meant the loss of their lives.  Soon after, they were captured and killed.  But remembering the monk's admonition at the moment of death, they harboured no hatred against anyone, and after death were reborn in the deva world (UdA.179f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vinaya relates (Vin.i.239) how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things (kappiyabhūmi) they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers.  When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen kappiyabhūmi.  The Apadāna verses ascribed to Yasoja in the Theragāthā are, in the Apadāna itself, found in two places: one under Labujadāyaka (Ap.ii.409) and the other, with slight variations, under Labujaphaladāyaka.  Ap.i.295.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasadatta Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;He belonged to a family of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/mallaa,Malla')"&gt;Malla&lt;/a&gt; chieftains and was educated at &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkasilaa,Takkasilā')"&gt;Takkasilā&lt;/a&gt;, where he attained great proficiency.  Later, while journeying in the company of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya,Sabhiya')"&gt;Sabhiya&lt;/a&gt;, he came to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt;, where he was present at the discussion between Sabhiya and the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;.  It was his purpose to try and discover flaws in the Buddha's argument.  The Buddha knew what was in his mind, and at the end of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sabhiya,Sabhiya Sutta')"&gt;Sabhiya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; admonished him in five verses (Thag.360 4).  Yasadatta was greatly moved and entered the Order, winning arahantship in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/padumuttara,Padumuttara')"&gt;Padumuttara&lt;/a&gt; Buddha, he had been a very learned brahmin, living as an ascetic in the forest.  One day he saw the Buddha, and, with clasped hands, praised his virtues (Thag.i.427f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is evidently identical with Ñānathavika of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/apadaana,Apadāna')"&gt;Apadāna&lt;/a&gt;.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yodhājīva&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A headman (gāmanī) who visited the Buddha and asked if it was true that men who fall fighting in battle are reborn among the Sārañjita devas.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first the Buddha refused to answer the question, but finding that Yodhājīva insisted, explained to him that fighting men were reborn after death either in the Sārājita niraya or among animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headman became the Buddha's follower.  S.iv.308.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yāmā.  &lt;/b&gt; A class of Devas, mentioned in lists of devas between those of Tāvatimsa and those of Tusita (E.g., Vin.i.12, A.i.228; iii.287; M.ii.194; iii.100, etc.).  Two hundred years of human life are but one day to the Yāma devā, and two thousand Years, composed of such days, form their life period (A.i.213; iv.253).  Sirimā, sister of Jīvaka, was born after death in the Yāma world and became the wife of Suyāma, king of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yāmabhavana.  From there she visited the Buddha with five hundred others.  SNA i.244f.; see also VvA.246 for an upāsaka born in the Yāma-world.  In the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.475) mention is made of four Yāma-devas who were reborn as men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meaning of Yāmā is explained in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.519; PSA.441) as "those that have attained divine bliss" (dibbam sukham yātā payātā sampattā ti Yāmā).  Other explanations are “misery freed" or "governing gods”.  Compendium, p.138, n.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yāmā.&lt;/b&gt; In some contexts, Yāmā seems to have been derived from Yama, king of the underworld - e.g in such expressions as "Yāmato yāva Akanittham" (From the underworld to the highest heaven).  KhA.166.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasa Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when the Buddha is staying at Icchānangala, with Nāgita as his attendant, the brahmins of Icchānangala come to pay him homage with various kinds of offerings and make a great noise and uproar as they wait outside the gate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha is disturbed by their noise and expresses his disapproval, whereupon, Nāgita begs of him to accept their homage and their gifts, The Buddha answers that he has no need for them; he has attained the happiness of renunciation, of insight, of awakening, of calm; happiness proceeding from gains and flattery is dung like.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knows of monks who joke and make merry, who eat their bellies full and give themselves up to languor and torpor, or live on the outskirts of some village.  They do not please him, but a forest dwelling monk pleases him because he knows that, some day, that monk will find emancipation.  A.iv.340ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yo no cedam Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there were no satisfaction from the earth element, beings would not lust after it; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if there were no misery in it, they would not be repelled by it; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if there were no escape from it, beings would not so escape; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;when all these things are fully known, beings will live aloof from the world.  S.ii.172.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasuttarā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yasuttarā.  &lt;/b&gt; One of the palaces occupied by Paduma Buddha in his last lay life.  BuA.146; but see Paduma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yasuttarā.&lt;/b&gt; A devatā of Tāvatimsa.  She had been a resident of Bārānasī.  She once spun two robes, and, having washed them, she offered them to the Buddha.  The Buddha accepted the gift and preached to her and she became a sotāpanna.  After death she was born in Tāvatimsa as Yasuttarā and was much loved by Sakka.  When she realized that her good fortune was due to her faith in the Buddha, she visited him at Jetavana and told him her story.  It is said that, owing to the power of her merit, she owned a most marvellous elephant.  Vv.iv.3; VvA.181ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yavapālaka Vimāna Vatthu &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of a yavapālaka of Rājagaha who gave a meal of sour gruel (kummāsa) to an arahant, and, as a result, was born in Tāvatimsa where Moggallāna met him and learnt his story.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yamaka Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thera Yamaka held the view that, in so far as a monk has destroyed the āsavas, he is broken up and perishes at the break up of the body and becomes not after death.  Yamaka's colleagues tried to correct this erroneous view (the heresy lies in the implication that "a being is broken up and perishes”; SA.ii.226.) but failed, and so reported him to Sāriputta.  Sāriputta visited Yamaka and argued with him that if it were false to say of anybody that he existed in truth, in reality, even in this very life, how much more so to speak of someone existing or not existing after death.  Yamaka thereupon confessed his error.  Sāriputta further elucidated the matter by using the simile of a man who enters the service of a rich householder with the intent to murder him.  Such a man would always be a murderer, even though his master knew him not to be so.  Even so, the disciple who regards body, etc., as permanent and so on, harbours a murderous view, even though he knows it not as such (S.iii.109ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sutta is often referred to.  (E.g., VibhA.32; Vsm.479; cp.  Vsm.626 (Yamakato sammasana).  Does Yamakato here mean "according to the Yamaka Sutta"?).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes called the Yamakovāda Sutta (E.g., Netti, p.  30).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Yonaka Dhammarakkhita Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was sent to Aparantaka at the conclusion of Moggaliputtapissa's Council (Mhv.xii.4).' There he preached the Aggikkhandhopama Sutta and converted thirty seven thousand beings.  Mhv.xii.34f.; Dpv.viii.7; Sp.i.67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yama&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The god of death.  (See, e.g., DhA.iii.337; Yamassa santikam = Maranasantikam).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When beings die they are led before him to be judged according to their deeds.  Birth, old age, illness, punishment for crime and death, are regarded as his messengers, sent among men as a warning to abstain from ill and do good.  Yama questions beings brought before him as to whether they have seen these messengers and profited by them.  If the answer is in the negative, the nirayapālas take them away to the different hells (M.iii.179ff).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_samaya_s,Mahāsamaya Sutta')"&gt;Mahāsamaya Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.259) mention is made of two Yamas (duve Yamā), which the Commentary explains (DA.ii.690) by "dve Yamakadevatā" (the twins, whom Rhys Davids calls the Castor and Pollux of Indian Mythology, in Dial.ii.290, n.1).  Elsewhere (AA.i.374; MA.ii.953) Buddhaghosa speaks of four Yamas (im c' esa eko va hoti, catusu pana dvāresu cattāro janā honti) at the four gates (of the Nirayas?).  He says that Yama is a Vemānikapetarājā, who sometimes enjoys all the pleasures of heaven, in a celestial mansion, surrounded by kapparukkhas, and at other times experiences the fruits of his kamma.  He is a good king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Jātakas* the Nirayas are particularly mentioned as Yama's abode (Yamakkhaya, Yamanivesana, Yamasādana, etc.); but, more generally, all Samsāra is considered as subject to Yama's rule, and escape from samsāra means escape from Yama's influence, Yama being the god of Death.  It is evidently in this sense that Yama is called Vesāyi (q.v.) (J.ii.317, 318).  Yama is sometimes mentioned** with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/i_/inda,Indra')"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/varuna,Varuna')"&gt;Varuna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/soma,Soma')"&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/pajapati,Pajāpati')"&gt;Pajāpati&lt;/a&gt;, etc., as a god to whom sacrifices are offered.  There is a tradition (A.i.142) that once Yama longed to be born as a human being and to sit at the feet of a Tathāgata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yama's Nayanāyudha is mentioned (SNA.i.225) among the most destructive of weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;* E.g., J.ii.318; iv.273; v.268, 274, 304. The Vetaranī is mentioned as forming the boundary of Yama's kingdom (i.21; J.ii.317; iii.472; but see ii.318).  At J.iv.405, Yama's abode is called Ussadaniraya.  DhA.i.334 explains Yamaloka by Catubbidham apāyalokam.  Cp.  PvA.33 (Yamaloko ti petaloko); ibid., 107 (Yamavisayam = Petalokam).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** E.g., J.vi.201; D.i.244; at Mil.37 the list includes Kuvera, Suyāma and Santusita; cp.  Mtu i.265; iii.68, 77; 77, 307.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yamaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yamaka.&lt;/b&gt; The sixth book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka.  It is divided into ten chapters (called Yamaka) Mūla, Khandha, Āyatana, Dhātu, Sacca, Sankhārā, Anusaya, Citta, Dhamma and Indriya.  The method of treatment of each of the ten divisions tends to be threefold.  Firstly, a Paññattivāra or section deliminating the term and concept, divided into an Uddesavāra, stating the inquiries only, and a Niddesavāra, wherein the inquiries are repeated with their several answers.  Secondly, and mainly, there is the Pavattivāra, referring not to procedure generally, but to living processes, and, lastly, the Pariññāvāra, dealing with the extent to which a given individual (i.e., a class of beings) understands the category under consideration.  There is a Commentary to the Yamaka by Buddhaghosa, which is included in the Pañcappakaranatthakathā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See P.T.S.  edn., i.xix ff.; the Yamaka has been published by the P.T.S.  1911, 1913.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

She married Vīravamma and had two daughters, Līlāvatī and Sugalā (Cv.lix.26).  She was later raised to the rank of rājinī (? queen) by Vijayabāhu, and erected a massive building, called Pāsādapāda, in the Kappūramūlāyatana.  Cv.lx.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yamelutekulā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two brahmins, probably named Yamelu and Tekula, who proposed to the Buddha that the Dhamma should be put into Sanskrit (chandasi).  The Buddha refused their request.  Vin.ii.139.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yuganaddha or Yuganandha Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ananda tells the monks at Ghositārāma, in Kosambī, that those who have attained arahantship have done so in one of four ways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;by developing insight preceded by calm, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;or calm preceded by insight, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;or calm and insight together, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;or by having a mind utterly devoid of perplexities about the Dhamma.  A.ii.157.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yamaka pātihāriya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miracle of the "double appearances”.  When the Buddha laid down a rule forbidding the exercise of supernatural powers by monks - following on the miracle performed by Pindola Bhāradvāja (q.v.) - the heretics went about saying that henceforth they would perform no miracles except with the Buddha.  Bimbisāra reported this to the Buddha, who at once accepted the challenge, explaining that the rule was for his disciples and did not apply to himself.  He, therefore, went to Sāvatthi, the place where all Buddhas perform the Miracle.  In reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of Asālha.  This was in the seventh year after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king's garden, accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvelous tree to sprout from its seed.  The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and they had to flee helter skelter.  It was during this flight that Pūrana Kassapa (q.v.) committed suicide.  The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, extended to a distance of thirty six leagues.  The Buddha created a jewelled walk in the air by the side of the Gandamba.  When the Buddha's disciples knew what was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the insinuations of the heretics.  Among such disciples were Gharanī, Culla Anātthapindika, Cīrā, Cunda, Uppalavannā and Moggallāna.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha refused their offers and related the Kanhausabha and Nandivisāla Jātakas.  Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he proceeded to perform the Yamaka-pātihāriya (Twin Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of opposite character in pairs - e.g., producing flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and then alternatively.  Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left.  DA.l.57; DhA.iii.214f.  explains how this was done.  From every pore of his body rays of six colors darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahmā and downwards to the edge of the Cakkavāla.  The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time to time.  It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the assembly.  At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to Tāvatimsa, there to preach the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff.  The DhA.  version appears to be entirely different from the Jātaka version; the latter is very brief and lacks many details, especially regarding Pindola's miracle and the preaching of the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa.  The account given in Dvy.  (143-66) is again different; the Miracle was evidently repeatedly performed by the Buddha (see, e.g., Candanamālā), and it is often referred to - e.g., J.i.77, 88, 193; Ps.i.125; SNA.i.36; AA.i.71; MA.ii.962; Mil.  349; Vsm.390; PvA.137; Dāthāvamsa i.50. The miracle was also performed by the Buddha's relics; see, .e.g., Mhv.xvii.52f.; Sp.i.88, 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said (Mil.349) that two hundred millions of beings penetrated to an understanding of the Dhamma at the conclusion of the Miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Miracle can only be performed by the Buddha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yuvañjaya Jātaka (No.  460)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Yuvañjaya, son of Sabbadatta, king of Ramma (Benares).  He was the eldest of one thousand sons, and Yuditthila was his younger brother.  After he came of age he was on his way early one morning to the park, and saw all around him dew.  In the evening, as he returned home, the dew drops were no more to be seen.  His charioteer explained that the sun had dried them up.  Reflecting on this, the prince realized the impermanence of life and asked his father's leave to renounce the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both his parents tried to dissuade him but they failed, and he and Yudhitthila built a hermitage in the Himālaya, where they became ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yudhitthila is identified with Ananda.  This story was told in reference to the Buddha's Renunciation, to some monks who marvelled at the Buddha's great sacrifice.  J.iv.119ff.; the story of Yuvañjaya (Yudhañjaya) is also given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.1; CypA.143ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yasa Thera.  &lt;/b&gt; He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures.  Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him.  He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming: "Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!" The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, "Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger." Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha.  The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma.  To Yasa's father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him.  (This is given as an example of the Buddha's iddhi power, Vsm.393).  At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha's follower, (he thus became the first tevācika upāsaka) and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant.  When, therefore, Yasa's presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order.  The next day, at the invitation of Yasa's father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa's mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā.  When Yasa's intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa's ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa's former friends and acquaintances (Vin.i.15 20; DhA.i.72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Sumedha Buddha, Yasa was a king of the Nāgas and invited the Buddha and his monks to his abode, where he showed them great honour and hospitality.  He then gave costly robes to the Buddha and to each monk a pair of valuable robes.  In the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a Treasurer, and offered the seven kinds of jewels at the Bodhi tree.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk.  For eighteen thousand kappas he was a deva king and one thousand times he was king of men.  Wherever he went he had a gold canopy, and in his last life over his funeral pyre was a gold canopy (ThagA.i.232f).  He is evidently identical with Sabbadāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333f).  A verse attributed to him is found in the Theragāthā (vs.117).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa is often quoted as one who enjoyed great luxury in his lay life (AA.ii.596).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.82f ) states that, in a past life, Yasa and his four companions wandered about engaged in various acts of social service.  One day they came across the dead body of a pregnant woman, which they took to the cemetery to be cremated.  There the others went away, leaving Yasa to finish the work.  While burning the corpse his mind was filled with thoughts of the foulness of the human body; he drew the attention of his friends to this idea, and, later, of his parents and wives, all of whom approved of what he said.  For this reason Yasa felt revulsion against the household life, and his friends and members of his family were able to realize the Dhamma early in the Buddha's career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordination of Yasa was one of the scenes of the Buddha's life to be sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.79).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.218f), Sujātā Senānīdhītā (who gave the Buddha a meal of milk rice just before his Enlightenment) was Yasa's mother.  She became a sotāpanna after listening to the Buddha's sermon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yasa.  &lt;/b&gt; Called &lt;b&gt;Kākandakaputta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the son of the brahmin Kākandaka and was a pupil of Ananda.  It is said he was fortunate enough to see the Buddha alive (Mhv.iv.57f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he arrived at the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuutaagaarasaalaa,Kūtāgārasālā')"&gt;Kūtāgārasālā&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavana,Mahāvana')"&gt;Mahāvana&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered that the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjiputtakaa,Vajjian')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; monks had raised the "Ten Points" (dasavatthu) contrary to the Buddha's teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples.  Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patisārattiyakamma (craving of pardon from lay folk).  This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them.  But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha's discourses to prove his charge.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniya Kamma (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhināpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion.  With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/revata,Revata')"&gt;Revata&lt;/a&gt; who lived in Soreyya.  Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Sankassa, Kannakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti.  Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day.  After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed (to settle the matter by an Ubbāhikā) of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sālha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana.  They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions.  At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly.  Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī.  Vin.ii.294ff.; Mhv.iv.9ff.;; Dpv.iv.45ff.; v.23. The Mhv.  says that at first the king (Kālāsoka) was inclined to support the Vajjians, but his sister, Nandā Therī, warned him against this (iv.  37ff.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monks who refused to accept the findings of the committee held another convocation, which was called the Mahāsangīti (Dpv.v.30ff.).  The Sattasatī Recital (also called The Second Recital) was also named (E.g., AA.i.251; MA.ii.880) Yasathera sangīti, evidently because of the prominent part played by Yasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasa is ranked (See, e.g., DA.ii.525) among the great benefactors of the religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yonā, Yavanā, Yonakā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country and its people.  The name is probably the Pāli equivalent for Ionians, the Baktrian Greeks.  The Yonas are mentioned with the Kambojas in Rock Edicts v.  and xii of Asoka, as a subject people, forming a frontier district of his empire.  The country was converted by the Thera Mahārakkhita, who was sent there after the Third Council (Mhv.xii.5; Dpv.viii.9; Sp.i.67).  In the time of Milinda the capital of the Yona country was Sāgala (Mil.1).  It is said (Mhv.xxix.39) that at the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa, thirty thousand monks, under Yona Mahādhammarakkhita, came from Alasandā in the Yona country.  Alasandā was evidently the headquarters of the Buddhist monks at that time.  Alasandā is generally identified (See, e.g., Geiger, Mhv.  Trs.  194, n.3) with the Alexandria founded by the Macedonian king (Alexander) in the country of the Paropanisadae near Kābul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Assalāyana Sutta (M.ii.149), Yona and Kamboja are mentioned as places in which there were only two classes of people, masters and slaves, and the master could become a slave or vice versa.  The Commentary (MA.ii.784) explains this by saying that supposing a brahmin goes there and dies, his children might consort with slaves, in which case their children would be slaves.  In later times, the name Yavanā or Yonā seems to have included all westerners living in India and especially those of Arabian origin (Cv.Trs.ii.87, n.1).  Yonaka, statues, holding lamps, were among the decorations used by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu (MA.ii.575).  The language of the Yavanas is classed with the Milakkhabhāsā (E.g., DA.i.276; VibhA.388).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.51) records that from the time of Kassapa Buddha the Yonakas went about clad in white robes, because of the memory of the religion which was once prevalent there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yugandhara&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Yugandhara.&lt;/b&gt; One of the mountains of the Himālaya (J.i.119, 232; iv.213; vi.125; DhA.i.249; Vsm.206).  It forms the first of the seven ranges round Sineru (SNA, ii.443; but according to J.vi.125 it is the fourth range).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yugandharasāgara (e.g., J.i.64; vi.43) is also sometimes mentioned, and was probably a sea between Yugandhara and the next mountain range.  When the Buddha reached Tāvatimsa in three strides, his first stride was from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216).  It was on the summit of Yugandhara that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6).  The sun is mentioned as first rising over Yugandhara (E.g., SA.ii.165), hence the expression “Like the morning sun over Yugandhara.” E.g.  PvA.137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yugandhara.&lt;/b&gt;-One of the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by the Buddha's followers in time of need.  D.iii.205&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

J.v.424, 426.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yudhitthila.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Sabbadatta, king of Ramma, and younger brother of the Bodhisatta, born as Yuvañjaya.  He is identified with Ananda.  See the Yuvañjaya Jātaka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Yudhitthila.&lt;/b&gt; The name of a gotta to which Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurus, belonged (J.iii.400; v.  59, etc.).  Mention is made also of a Koravyarājā of the Yudhitthilagotta (J.iv.361).  Probably the kings of the Kurus (q.v.) belonged mostly to a dynasty that claimed its descent from Yudhitthila (Yudhisthira?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yasalālaka, Tissa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger brother of Candamukha Siva.  He killed Siva at the festival sports at Tissavāpi and ruled as king for seven years and eight months (112-20 A.C.).  His gate watchman, Subha, bore a strong resemblance to him, and Tissa would sometimes deck Subha in all his royal ornaments and place him on the throne, where all the nobles of the court paid him homage, thinking him to be the king, Tissa, meanwhile, enjoying the fun, as watchman.  One day, as Tissa stood at the door, laughing to himself, Subha charged him with impertinence and ordered the guard to slay him.  Mhv.xxxv.49ff.; Dpv.xxi.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

D.ii.7; J.i.43; Bu.xxiv.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Yaññadatta.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Ani Mandavya.  While he was playing, his ball rolled into an anthill, and, all unsuspecting, he put his hand in and was bitten by a snake.  He was cured by "Acts of Truth" performed by his parents and by Kanha Dīpāyana (J.iv.30f).  See the Kanhadīpāyana Jātaka.  He is identified with Rāhula.  J.iv.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yakkha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A class of non human beings generally described as amanussā.  They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas) (E.g., J.v.420).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other lists (E.g., PvA.  45, 55) they range immediately above the Petas; in fact, some of the happier Petas are called Yakkhas.  Elsewhere (E.g., A.ii.38) they rank, in progressive order, between manussā and gandhabbā.  They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks.  In the early records, yakkha, like nāgā, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative.  Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to (M.i.252; J.iv.4; DA.i.264), but even the Buddha is spoken of as a yakkha in poetic diction (M.i.386).  Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed (S.i.54).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a passage in the Vimānavatthu Commentary, (VvA.333) which gives illustrations, the term is used for Sakka, the Four Regent Gods (Mahārājāno), the followers of Vessavana, and also for puriso (individual soul?).  In the scholiast to the Jayadissa Jātaka (J.v.33), the figure of the hare in the moon is also called yakkha.  Of these above named, the followers of Vessavana appear to be the Yakkhas proper.  The term yakkha as applied to purisa is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning "soul" in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi (SN.vs.478), or ettāvat' aggam no vadanti h' ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha pānditāse (SN.vs.875).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Niddesa (MNid.282), yakkha is explained by satta, nara, mānava, posa, puggala, jīva, jagu, jantu, indagu, manuja.  The last term is significant as showing that yakkha also means "man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants.  To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes.  The worship of trees and the spirits inhabitating them is one of the most primitive forms of religion.  Some, at least, of the yakkhas are called rukkha devatā (E.g., J.iii.309, 345; Pv.i.9; PvA.5) (spirits of trees), and others bhummadevatā, (PvA.45,55) (spirits of the earth), who, too, seem to have resided in trees.  Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva's supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful.  They are sometimes called devatā (E.g., S.i.205), or devaputta (E.g., PvA.  113, 139).  Some of these, like Indakūta and Suciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics.  All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.  An epithet frequently applied is mahiddhika (E.g., Pv.ii.9; J.vi.118).  Their appearance is striking as a result of former good kamma (Pv.i.2, 9; ii.11; iv.3, etc.).  They are also called kāmakāmī, enjoying all kinds of luxuries (Pv.i.3), but, because of former bad kamma, they are possessed of odd qualities, thus they are shy, they fear palmyra leaf and iron.  Their eyes are red and they neither wink nor cast a shadow.  J.iv.492; v.34; vi.336, 337; these various characteristics are, obviously, not found in all Yakkhas.  The Yakkhas are evidently of different grades - as is the case with all classes of beings - the highest among them approximate very nearly to the devas and have deva-powers, the lowest resemble petas.  The Yakkhas are specially mentioned as being afraid of palm leaves (J.iv.492).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their abode is their self created palace, which is anywhere, in the air, in trees, etc.  These are mostly ākasattha (suspended in the air), but some of them, like the abode of Ālavaka, are bhumattha (on the ground) and are described as being fortified (SNA.i.222).  Sometimes whole cities e.g., Ālakamandā stand under the protection of, or are inhabited by, Yakkhas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many respects they resemble the Vedic Pisācas, though they are of different origin.  They are evidently remnants of an ancient demonology and have had incorporated in them old animistic beliefs as representing creatures of the wilds and the forests, some of them based on ethnological features.  (See Stede: Gespenstergeschichten des Petavatthu v.39ff ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later literature the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres.  The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male.  They eat flesh and blood (J.iv.549; v.34); and devour even men (D.ii.346; J.ii.15ff.) and corpses (J.i.265).  They eat babies (J.v.21; vi.336) and are full of spite and vengeance (DhA.i.47; ii.35f.).  The story of Bhūta Thera is interesting because his elder brothers and sisters were devoured by a hostile Yakkha, so the last child is called Bhūta to propitiate the Yakkha by making him the child's sponsor!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence.  They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii.  In the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.194f), however, the Yakkha king, Vessavana, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas.  Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts.  Cp.  the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta (Ud.iv.4).  But the Mahā Yakkhas (a list in D.iii.204f), the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them.  Among Yakkhas are some beings who are sotāpannas - e.g., Janavasabha, Suciloma and Khara (s.v.).  Some Yakkhas even act as messengers from another world, and will save prospective sinners from committing evil (Pv.iv.1).  The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāni is of special interest.  D.i.95. The Commentary (DA.i.264) says he is not an ordinary Yakkha, but Sakka himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambattha, if he does not answer the Buddha's question the third time he is asked.  In many cases the Yakkhas are "fallen angels" and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyankaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavana, listening to Velukandakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga (A.iv.63).  At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (q.v.) many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out (Stede, op.  cit) that the names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function.  These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc.  e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Ālavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāni or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc.  e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Punnaka, Māra, Sakata; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Pandaka, Sīvaka, Serī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana (q.v.) is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas.  He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Ātānātiya Sutta (D.iii.199ff) contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls.  Vessavana is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers.  They wait upon him in turn.  The Yakkhinīs draw water for him, and often are so hard worked that many die in his service.  E.g., J.iv.492. Mention is also made (e.g., DA.ii.370) of Yakkhadāsīs who have to dance and sing to the devas during the night.  Early in the morning they drink a cup of toddy (surā) and go off into a deep sleep, from which they rise betimes in the evening ready for their duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavana (D.ii.207).  Among the duties of Vessavana is the settling of disputes between the devas, and this keeps him (J.vi.270) much occupied.  In this work he is helped by the Yakkhasenāpati, whose business it is to preside over the courts during eight days of each mouth (SNA.i.197).  The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies on Manosilātala on the Bhagalavatīpabbata (SNA.i.187; cp.  D.iii.201 and DA.iii.967).  As followers of Kuvera, lord of riches, the Yakkhas are the guardians and the liberal spenders of underground riches, hidden treasures, etc., with which they delight men.  E.g., Pv.ii.11; PvA.145; Pv.iv.12; PvA.274. These were seven yakkhas who guarded the wealth of Jotiyasetthi (DhA.iv.208f.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas, who are the aborigines of Ceylon (Lankā), were considered human or non human.  Kuvenī, one of their princesses, and her maid, can both assume different forms, but Vijaya marries Kuveni and has two children by her.  (Cp.  Vin.iii.37; iv.  20; where sexual intercourse with a Yakkha is forbidden).  The Yakkhas are invisible, and Vijaya is able to kill them only with the help of Kuveni (Mhv.vii.36); but their clothes are found fit for Vijaya and his followers to wear (Mhv.vii.38).  Again, Cetiyā (q.v.) could make herself invisible and assume the form of a mare, but Pandukābhaya lived with her for four years and she gave him counsel in battle.  Later, when he held festivities, he had the Yakkha Cittarāja on the throne beside him (Mhv.x.87).  In all probability these Yakkhas were originally considered as humans, but later came to be confused with non humans.  Their chief cities were Lankāpura and Sirīsavatthu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commonly accepted etymology of Yakkha is from the root yaj, meaning to sacrifice.  Thus: yajanti tattha balim upaharantī ti yakkha (VvA.224), or pūjanīyabhāvato yakkho, ti uccati (VvA.333).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Yavakalāpiya Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If six men, armed with flails, were to beat out a sheaf of corn, it would be thoroughly threshed.  Thus are putthujjanas threshed by objects, etc.; thoughts of a future birth thresh them even more thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Vepacitti and the Asuras were defeated by Sakka and the Devas and Vepacitti was bound hand and foot.  But when Vepacitti thought that the Devas were righteous, his bonds slackened.  Subtle were the bonds of Vepacitti, but more subtle are those of Māra.  He who possesses conceits of tanhā ditthi māna is Māra's bondsman.  S.iv.201ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vesākha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The month of April May.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradition says that the Buddha's birth, Enlightenment and death, took place on the full moon day of Vesākha (E.g., J.i.; BuA.248; Mhv.iii.2).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vesākha-pūjā was always celebrated by the kings of Ceylon (See, e.g., Mhv.xxxii.35; xxxv.100; Cv.li.84.).  The full moon day of Vesākha was chosen for very solemn undertakings, such as the crowning of Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xi.42), the laying of the Foundation Stone of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxix.1), etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedehamuni&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A name given to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/aa/aananda,Ananda')"&gt;Ananda&lt;/a&gt;.  (S.i.215, 219; cf.  Mhv.iii.36; Ap.i.7; DhSA., p.1).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commentary explains Vedeha by pandita.  (Vedehamunino ti panditamunino.  Pandito hi ñānasankhātena vedena īhati sabbakiccāni karoti, tasmā vedeho ti vuccati.  Vedeho ca so muni cāti = Vedehamuni).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Apadāna Commentary (ApA.i.106), however, gives another explanation, according to which Ananda was the son of a Videha lady (Videharatthe jātā, tassā deviyā putto).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SA.ii.132 ; cf.  MT.149 (vedena paññāya īhati pavattatīti = vedeho).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedeha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vedeha.&lt;/b&gt; The title of several kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa,Mithilā')"&gt;Mithilā&lt;/a&gt;, capital of Videha - e.g., &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suruci,Suruci')"&gt;Suruci&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.319); Sādhīna (J.iv.355, 356); &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/somanassa,Somanassa')"&gt;Somanassa&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.47); &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi,Nimi')"&gt;Nimi&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.102), and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ay/angati,Angati')"&gt;Angati&lt;/a&gt; (J.vi.222, etc.).  v.l.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videha')"&gt;Videha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vedeha.  &lt;/b&gt; See &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videha')"&gt;Videha&lt;/a&gt; (2) and (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vedeha.  &lt;/b&gt; The personal name of the king of Kāsi, mentioned in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/maatuposaka_jat_455,Mātuposaka Jātaka')"&gt;Mātuposaka Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iv.94).  He is identified with Ananda.  J.iv.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vedeha.&lt;/b&gt; The personal name of the king of Mithilā, whose minister was Mahosadha.  For his story see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahaummagga_jat_546,Mahāummagga Jātaka')"&gt;Mahāummagga Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  He is identified with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/l/laludayi_th,Lāludāyī')"&gt;Lāludāyī&lt;/a&gt;.  J.vi.478.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vedeha.  &lt;/b&gt; A rich householder of Hamsavatī, in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He was a former birth of Mahā Kassapa (q.v.).  AA.i.93; ThagA.ii.134; SA.ii.135; ApA.i.209.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vedeha.  &lt;/b&gt; A Thera of Ceylon, who belonged to the Araññavāsī Nikāya.  He wrote the Rasavāhinī and the Samantakūtavannanā, and also, probably, the Singhalese grammar known as the Sidatsangarā.  He lived in the thirteenth century and was a pupil of Ananda Vanaratna.  P.L.C.  222f.; Svd.1263.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vijaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vijaya.  &lt;/b&gt; The first Ariyan king of Ceylon.  He was the eldest of the thirty two sons of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/siihabaahu,Sīhabāhu')"&gt;Sīhabāhu&lt;/a&gt;, king of Lāla, and of Sīhasīvalī.  Because of his evil conduct he, with seven hundred others, was deported by the king, with their heads half shaved.  Their wives and children were deported with them.  The children landed at Naggadīpa and the women at Mahilādīpaka (MT.  264).  Vijaya and the other men landed at Suppāraka, but was obliged to leave owing to the violence of his supporters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dpv.ix.26, Vijaya went from Suppāraka to Bhārukaccha, where he stayed for three months.  They reached Ceylon on the day of the Buddha's death, received the protection of the deva Uppalavanda, and thus escaped destruction by the Yakkhas.  The Yakkhinī, Kuvenī, fell in love with Vijaya, and he, with her assistance, killed the Yakkhas of Lankāpura and Sirīsavatthu, and founded the city of Tambapanni.  Vijaya's chief ministers, Anurādha, Upatissa, Ujjena, Uruvela and Vijita, founded separate colonies, named after themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijaya had two children by Kuvenī, Jīvahattha and Dīpellā; but when he wished to be consecrated king, he sent for and obtained, for his wife, a daughter of the Pandu king of Madhurā.  Kuvenī, thereupon, left him and was killed by the Yakkhas.  Vijaya reigned for thirty eight years and was succeeded by Panduvāsudeva.  For details of Vijaya's life, see Mhv.vi.38ff.; vii.6ff.; viii.1 3; Dpv.ix.6ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt; and Vijaya were contemporaries, Ajātasattu's twenty fourth year of kingship corresponding to Vijaya's sixteenth year.  Dpv.iv.27; v.77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vijaya.  &lt;/b&gt; See Vijayakumāra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vijaya&lt;/b&gt;.  Minister of Angati, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/videha,Videha')"&gt;Videha&lt;/a&gt;.  For details see the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahanaradakassapa_jat_544,Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka')"&gt;Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.  He is identified with Sāriputta.  J.vi.255.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vijaya.&lt;/b&gt; A king of Benares, descended from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahasammata,Mahāsammata')"&gt;Mahāsammata&lt;/a&gt;.  His son was Vijitasena.  Dpv.iii.39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vijaya.&lt;/b&gt; A householder, mentioned as an exemplary layman.  A.iii.451.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vijaya Thera&lt;/b&gt;.  He was born in Sāvatthi and was versed in brahmin lore.  Then he became an ascetic and lived in the forest.  Having heard of the Buddha, Vijaya visited him and joined the Order, becoming an arahant in due course.  In the time of Piyadassī Buddha he was a rich householder and built a jewelled cornice (vedikā) round the Buddha's thūpa.  Sixteen kappas ago he became king thirty six times, under the name of Manippabhāsa (Thag.  vs.  92; ThagA.i.191f).  He is probably identical with Vedikāraka Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.171.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Vijaya.  &lt;/b&gt; Mentioned with Jātimitta, as a patron of Meteyya Buddha.  Anāgat.  vs.  59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

At its foot was the Sattapanniguhā, where the first Convocation was held (Vin.ii.76; W.  159; Sp.i.10, etc.).  The river Tapodā (q.v.) rose in a lake at the foot of Vebhāra.  SA.i.30f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vebhāra.  &lt;/b&gt; A city in which Padumuttara Buddha preached and ordained ninety crores of men.  Bu.xi.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vebhāra.&lt;/b&gt; The birthplace of Siddhattha Buddha, where, later, he preached the Buddhavamsa, when ninety crores of beings realized the Truth.  Bu.xvii.5, 13; BuA.  p.  186; J.i.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vebhāra.&lt;/b&gt; A city built by Vissakamma, where Valliya Thera (Candanamāliya) lived in a previous birth.  ThagA.i.294; Ap.ii.424.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vebhāra.&lt;/b&gt; v.l.  for Dvebhāra (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedehiputta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epithet constantly used in connection with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/ajatasattu,Ajātasattu')"&gt;Ajātasattu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddhagosa,Buddhaghosa')"&gt;Buddhaghosa&lt;/a&gt; explains it* by saying that Videhī here means a wise woman and not the Videha lady, because Ajātasattu's mother was the daughter, not of a king of Videha, but of a Kosala king.  (E.g., J.iii.121; iv.342; she was called Kosaladevī e.g., J.ii.403).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Vedehiputto ti, vedehīti panditā dhivacanam etam; pandititthiyā putto ti attho (SA.i.120); cf.  DA.i.139.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Nirayāvalī Sūtra, (Jacobi, Jaina Sutras, SBE.xxii.  Introd., p.xiii) there was, among the wives of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bimbisara,Bimbisāra')"&gt;Bimbisāra&lt;/a&gt;, Callanā, daughter of Cetaka, a rājā of Vaisāli, whose sister Trisālā was the mother of Mahāvīra.  She was also called Srībhadrā.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Tibetan Dulvā (Rockhill: Life of the Buddha, 63f), Ajatasattu's mother was Vāsavī, daughter of Simha of Vaisāli.  It was foretold that Vāsavī's son would kill his father.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cf.  &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vedehikaa,Vedehikā')"&gt;Vedehikā&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vedehamuni,Vedehamuni')"&gt;Vedehamuni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vehapphala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Brahma worlds of the Rūpaloka plane.  Beings are born there as a result of developing the Fourth Jhāna (AbhS.  chap.  v., see.  3 d).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their life span is five hundred mahakalpas, (Ibid., sec.  6; A.ii.128, 129) and even puthujjanas can be born there (VbhA.376).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baka Brahma was once an inhabitant of Vehapphala (J.iii.358; SA .i.162).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anāgāmīs born there reach Nibbāna without going elsewhere (VbhA.522).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains (Ibid., 521= MA.i.29) the name thus: vipulā phalā ti = Vehapphalā.  In ages in which the world is destroyed by wind, Vehapphala forms the limit of the destruction (CypA.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Velukantakī, Velukandakī, Velukantakiyā&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lady of Velukanta (Velukanda).  She is mentioned as an exemplary lay woman (A.i.88; ii.164).  She founded, for the Order headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna an offering which the Buddha praised, because it was endowed with the six requisite qualities.  See Dāna Sutta (1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once she rose before dawn and sang the Parāyana.  Vessavana happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south (to see the Buddha, says SNA.i.369), and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise it and to reveal his identity.  She greeted him cordially, and in return for her greeting he announced to her that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were on their way to Velukanta.  She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to the monastery, inviting the monks to the house.  After the meal, she informed the Elders that Vessavana had told her of their arrival.  When they expressed their amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her.  Her only son Nanda was seized by the king's men and killed before her eyes, but she experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having been born as a Yakkha (Bhummadevatā says the Commentary), revealed himself to her.  She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the four jhānas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters.  The monks expressed their great admiration and Sāriputta preached to her (A.iv.63ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.718; cf.  SNA.i.370) that she was an anāgāmī, and that, when she promised to share with Vessavana the merits she would gain by entertaining the monks, headed by the two Chief Disciples, Vessavana, to show his gratitude, filled her stores with rice, and these stores remained always full throughout her life.  They thus became proverbial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.370) states that she kept a daily fast and knew the Pitakas by heart.  It also says that, at the end of her recital of the Parāyana, Vessavana offered her a boon, and she asked that, as her servants were weary of carrying the harvest home from the fields, Vessavana should allow his Yakkhas to do the work for them.  To this he agreed, and his followers filled for her one thousand two hundred and fifty store houses.  Vessavana then went to the Buddha and told him of what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.340) mentions Velukantakī Nandamātā and Khujjattarā as the chief lay women disciples of the Buddha.  But in the Anguttara list' of eminent lay women, while Velukantakī Nandamātā's name does not occur, Khujjatarā is mentioned.  Mention is made of a Nandamātā, eminent in meditation, but she is called Uttarā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.i.26; cf.  S.ii.236, where the same two are mentioned; Mrs.  Rhys Davids thinks that Velukantakī Nandamātā is probably identical with Uttarā Nandamātā (Brethren 4, n.1).  This identification does not seem to be correct.  See Uttarā Nandamātā; see also Nanda-Kumāputta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vijayabāhu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vijayabāhu.  &lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu I., 1059-1114 A.C.).  His earlier name was Kitti; his parents were Moggallāna and Lokitā (Cv.lvii.42f.; but see Cv.Trs.i.201, n.1), and from his thirtieth year he lived in Mūlasālā.  Later, without the knowledge of his parents, he left home, defeated the general Loka, and became Adipāda of Malaya after bringing this province under his power.  At the age of sixteen he defeated Kassapa, chief of the Kesadhātus, and became ruler of Rohana as well, assuming the title of Yuvarāja and the name of Vijayabāhu.  At this time the Colas were in possession of the government at Pulatthipura, and they made efforts to stem the advance of Vijayabāhu.  They were at first successful, owing to the disunion among the Singhalese themselves, but Vijayabāhu conquered the Cola armies near Palutthapabbata and marched to Pulatthipura.  He was helped by forces sent by the king of Rāmañña, to whom he sent an embassy with various presents.  He had, however, to bide his time, and retreated to Vātagiri.  From there he went, in due course, to Mahānāgahula, his officers having, in the meantime, crushed all opposition in Dakkhinadesa and captured the province of Anurādhapura and the district round Mahātittha.  When he felt the right moment had arrived, Vijayabāhu marched once more to Pulatthipura and captured it after a siege of one and a half months.  From there he advanced to Anurādhapura, spent three months in the city and returned to Pulatthipura.  This was fifteen years after he became Yuvarāja.  In the eighteenth year he crowned himself king, under the title of Sirisanghabodhi, making his younger brother Vīrabāhu Yuvarāja and governor of Dakkhinadesa, and his other brother, Jayabāhu, Adipāda and governor of Rohana.  The king had several queens, among whom was Līlāvatī, a Cola princess and daughter of Jagatīpāla; by her he had a daughter Yasodharā.  Another of his queens was a Kālinga princess, Tilokasundarī, by whom he had five daughters Subhaddā, Sumittā, Lokanāthā, Ratanāvalī and Rūpavatī and a son called Vikkamabāhu.  Vijayabāhu gave his younger sister, Mittā, in marriage to the king of Pandu, refusing an offer of marriage made by the Cola king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When peace had been established, Vijayabāhu sent messengers to Anuruddha, king of Rāmañña, and fetched monks from that country to help in the reformation of the Sangha in Ceylon.  He gave over the whole district of Alisāra for the use of the monks and built many vihāras.  He translated the Dhammasangani and held an annual Dandissara offering.  He also had the Tipitaka copied, and presented the copies to various monks.  Because the Singhalese envoys sent to Kannāta were insulted and maimed, the king prepared to send a punitive expedition to Cola, but the Velakkāra troops revolted, captured Mittā and her children, and burned the king's palace.  The king was forced to retreat to Dakkhinadesa but, with the help of Vīrabāhu, he defeated the rebels.  In the forty fifth year of his reign he took an army to Cola and stopped at a seaport in that country; but as the Cola king refused to accept his challenge to fight, he returned to his own country.  He repaired many tanks and restored many vihāras in various parts of the country.  He provided facilities for pilgrims journeying to Samantakūta, and patronized the Lābhavāsī and the Vantajīvaka monks.  He ruled for fifty five years.  Vīrabāhu died before him, and he made Jayabāhu Uparāja in his place.  For details of Vijayabāhu's reign, see Cv.  chaps.  lviii lx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vijayabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; Sister's son of Parakkamabāhu I.  and king of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu II., 1186-87 A.C.).  He succeeded his uncle.  Among his acts was the grant of an amnesty to all those imprisoned by Parakkamabāhu I., and the dispatch of an embassy to the king of Arimaddana with a letter in Pāli, composed by himself.  He was a good king, but was slain at the end of one year's reign by Mahinda (afterwards Mahinda VI.).  His viceroy was Kittinissanka.  Cv.lxxx.1-18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vijayabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu III., 1232-36 A.C.).  He claimed descent from King Sirisanghabodhi I.  and was lord of the Vannī.  He found the government of Ceylon in the hands of the Damilas, and, after defeating them, he established the seat of government in Jambuddoni.  He sent for the monks, who, with Vācissara at their head, had left Ceylon during the preceding disturbed period and had deposited the Buddha's Alms bowl and Tooth Relic in the rock fortress at Billasela.  The king did much for the reform of the priesthood and built various monasteries, chief of which was the Vijayasundarārāma and the Vijayabāhu vihāra.  He had two sons, Parakkamabāhu and Bhuvanekabāhu.  He appointed the Elder Sangharakkhita as head of the Order in Ceylon.  Cv.lxxxi.10ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vijayabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu IV., 1271-72 A.C.).  He was the eldest of the five sons of Parakkamabāhu II., his brothers being Bhuvanekabāhu, Tibhuvanamalla, Parakkamabāhu and Jayabāhu.  With the consent of the monks, Parakkamabāhu II.  handed over the government, before his death, to Vijayabāhu, who was evidently very popular, and was known among his subjects as a Bodhisatta.  (See, e.g., Cv.lxxxviii.35).  He restored Pulatthipura and built and renovated numerous monasteries, among them the vihāra at Titthagāma.  During his reign, Candabhānu invaded Ceylon, but was defeated by the king with the help of his Adipāda, Vīrabāhu.  Vijayabāhu built a city near Subhagiri and made it his seat of government.  He restored the Ratnāvalī cetiya and gave Anurādhapura into the charge of the Vanni chiefs.  Later, when Vīrabāhu had completely restored Pulatthipura, the king was consecrated there in the presence of his father, who came over from Jambuddoni.  Then, at the desire of his father, he held, on the Mahāvālukagangā, at Sahassatittha, a festival for admission into the Order.  The celebrations lasted a fortnight, and the king conferred on the monks various ranks, such as mahāsāmipāda, mūlatherapāda, parivenathera, etc.  Two years after the death of Parakkamabāhu, Vijayabāhu was slain by a treacherous general, named Mitta.  For details regarding Vijayabāhu, see Cv.lxxxvii.14 xc.1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vijayabāhu's son was Parakkamabāhu III .  Cv.xc.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vijayabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu V.).  He succeeded Vannibhuvanekabāhu, and was himself succeeded by Bhuvanekabāhu IV.  Cv.xc.105; he was among the successors of Parakkamabāhu IV., and reigned somewhere between 1302 and 1346 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Vijayabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vijayabāhu VI.).  He was one of the successors of Parakkamabāhu VI.  His immediate predecessor was Vīraparakkamabāhu.  Cv.xcii.4; his reign was somewhere between 1405 and 1411 A.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Visavanta Jātaka (No.  69)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a snake bite doctor, and, on one occasion, when a countryman had been bitten by a snake, the doctor ordered the snake to be brought and asked it to suck the poison out of the wound.  This the snake refused to do even though threatened with death by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a vow taken by Sāriputta.  Some villagers once brought some meal cakes to the monastery, and when the monks present there had eaten, it was suggested that what remained should be saved for those monks who were absent in the village.  This was done, but a young colleague of Sāriputta, arriving very late, found that Sāriputta had already eaten his portion, whereat he was very disappointed.  Sāriputta immediately vowed never again to touch meal cakes, and the Buddha said that Sāriputta would never return to anything which he had once renounced.  The snake is identified with Sāriputta.

Vimalabuddhi Thera.&lt;/b&gt; Author of the Mukhamattadīpanī on Kaccāyana's grammar and a tīkā on the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha.  To him is also ascribed the authorship of the Nyāsa of Kaccāyana's grammar (P.L.C.  204; Bode, op.  cit., 21; Gv.  63, 72).  He was probably of Ceylon, but the Sāsanavamsa (p.  75) claims him as a thera, of Pagan.  He is sometimes called Mahāvimalabuddhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vimalabuddhi.&lt;/b&gt; Called Cūla-Vimalabuddhi or Nava-Vimalabuddhi He wrote a tīkā on the Vuttodaya.  Gv.67; he lived either in Pagan or in Panya; Sās.  75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

He, therefore, urged his oxen on to the top of their speed and reached home safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told to Anāthapindika, who had a similar experience.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vipassī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth of the twenty four Buddhas.  He was born in the Khema park in Bandhumatī, his father being Bandhumā and his mother Bandhumatī.  He belonged to the Kondañña gotta.  For eight thousand years he lived as a householder in three palaces: Nanda, Sunanda and Sirimā.  His body was eighty cubits in height.  His wife was Sutanā (v.l.  Sudassanā) and his son Samavattakkhandha.  He left the household in a chariot and practised austerities for eight months.  Just before his enlightenment, the daughter of Sudassana setthi gave him milk rice, while a yavapālaka named Sujāta gave grass for his seat.  His bodhi was a pātali tree.  He preached his first sermon in Khemamigadāya to his step brother Khandha and his purohita's son Tissa; these two later became his chief disciples.  His constant attendant was Asoka; Candā and Candamittā were his chief women disciples.  His chief lay patrons were Punabbasummitta and Nāga among men, and Sirimā and Uttarā among women.  He died in Sumittārāma at the age of eighty thousand, and his relics were enshrined in a thūpa seven leagues in height.  The Bodhisatta was a Nāga king named Atula.  (Bu.xx.1ff.; BuA.195f.; D.ii.2ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three reasons are given for the name of this Buddha (BuA.195; cf.  DA.ii.454; SA.ii.15): (1) Because he could see as well by night as by day; (2) because he had broad eyes; (3) because he could see clearly after investigation.  Vipassī held the uposatha only once in seven years (DhA.iii.236), but on such occasions the whole Sangha was present (Sp.i.186).  The construction of a Gandhakuti for Vipassī brought Mendaka great glory in the present age.  Mendaka's name at the time was Avaroja (DhA.iii.364f).  Aññākondañña was then known as Cūlakāla, and nine times he gave Vipassī Buddha the first fruits of his fields.  DhA.i.81f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Visayha Jātaka (No.  340)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once born as Visayha, setthi of Benares, and gave alms daily to six hundred thousand persons in six different parts of the city.  Sakka's throne was heated by his great generosity, and, feeling nervous for his safety, Sakka contrived that all Visayha's possessions should disappear.  Quite undaunted, Visayha became a grass cutter, and for six days gave alms from the money so earned, he and his wife fasting.  On the seventh day, while cutting grass, he fainted, and Sakka, appearing before him, suggested that he, should be moderate in his generosity.  Visayha rejected the suggestion as unworthy and declared that his aim was Buddhahood.  Thereupon Sakka praised him and made him prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to Anāthapindika, as mentioned in the Khadirangāra Jātaka.  Visayha's wife is identified with Rāhulamātā.  J.iii.128 32; see also J.i.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is given in the Jātakamālā (No.  5), where the setthi is called Avisayha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedalla&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last of the nine angas or divisions of the Tipitaka, according to matter.  (M.i.133; Pug.iv.9; Gv.27; Vin.iii.8; Mil.  263).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes such suttas as the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_vedalla_s,Culla-Vedalla')"&gt;Culla-Vedalla, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavedalla_s,Mahā-Vedalla')"&gt;Mahā-Vedalla, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sammaditthi_s,Sammāditthi')"&gt;Sammāditthi, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakkapanha_sutta,Sakkapañha')"&gt;Sakkapañha, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sankhārabhājanīya, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahapunnama_sutta,Mahāpunnama')"&gt;Mahāpunnama&lt;/a&gt;, and others, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;which were preached in answer to questions asked through knowledge and joy (sabbe pi vedañ ca tutthiñ ca laddhā pucchitasuttantā).

When Khemā left the world, Vijayā went to her, and, having listened to her teaching, joined the Order under her, attaining arahantship soon afterwards (ThigA.159f.; her Udāna verses are included in Thig.169 74.).  She may be identical with the Vijayā, mentioned in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.130) a Bhikkhunī whom Māra, assuming the form of a young main, tried unsuccessfully to tempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitthāra Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vitthāra Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The five indriyas, if completely cultivated, lead to arahantship; in lesser degree to lower attainments.  S.v.201f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vitthāra Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; A detailed account of deeds which are dark with dark result, bright with bright result, dark and bright with mixed results, neither dark nor bright the last leading to non doing.  A.ii.230f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vepacitti&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Asura chieftain, who was present with Namuci (Māra) at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.259).  It is said that among the Asuras, Vepacitti, Rāhu and Pahārada were the chiefs.  E.g., AA.ii.758, Vepacitti being the highest (sabbajetthaka, SA.i.263).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vepacitti was the friend of Rāhu, and when Rāhu seized Candimā and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to Vepacitti that Rāhu fled for comfort (S.i.50, 51).  The Asuras being once defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhammā hall.  There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mātalī, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool.  S.i.221f.; cf.  S.iv.201, according to which his bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound.  Vepacitti's capture is referred to in Thag.vs.749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech.  Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse.  Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding.  Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti's verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony (S.i.222f).  Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him.  "Stop," said Sakka, "thou art my prisoner"; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free (S.i.225).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.266) that Vepacitti's original name was Sambara (q.v.).  When Sambara refused to give to the seers, who visited him, a pledge that the Asuras would not harm them, the seers cursed him, and from that time onwards he slept badly and was plagued by nightmares.  This so deranged his mind (cittam vepati) that he came to be called Vepacitti ("Crazy nerve").  When Vepacitti lay ill of this disease, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara's magic art.  Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka's offer, warning him that Sambara, having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a similar fate (S.i.238f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa explains that, if Vepacitti had taught him the art, it was Sakka's intention to take Vepacitti to the seers and persuade them to forgive him (SA.i.272).  This episode seems to contradict Buddhaghosa's previous statement that Sambara and Vepacitti were identical.  Perhaps, as Mrs.  Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.305, n.4), Sambara was the name of an office rather than that of a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made (S.i.226) of a visit once paid by Sakka and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut.  Vepacitti, in his buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate.  Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.265) the strange relations of Sakka and Vepacitti by saying that they were father and son in law, and that they were sometimes at war with each other; sometimes, however, they lived in concord.  The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.278 L; cf.  J.i.205f ) gives the story of the romantic marriage of Sakka to Vepacitti's daughter, Sujā (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Kathā vatthu, other members of Vepacitti's family appear to have intermarried with the devas, and the Kathā vatthu Commentary says that a troop of Asuras, belonging to the retinue of Vepacitti, was once freed from the fourfold plane of misery and was taken up among the devas.  See Points of Controversy, p.  211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit texts call him Vemacitra or Vemacitrī.  E.g., Dvy., pp.  126, 148; Mtu.iii.138,254.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vīra &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vīra Thera.&lt;/b&gt; He was born in Sāvatthi in the family of a minister of Pasenadi and became a great warrior.  He married, and, on the birth of his son, left the world, attaining arahantship in due course.  His former wife tried to win him back to household life, but he showed her in a verse (Thag.  vs.  8) that her efforts were futile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he swept the Buddha's hermitage and offered him niggunthi flowers.  Later, he was born as King Mahāpatāpa.  In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a very rich merchant and gave milk rice to the monks and alms to the poor (ThagA.i.50).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Niggundipupphiya Thera of the Apadāna.  Ap.i.205.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vīra.  &lt;/b&gt; A setthi whose daughter gave milk rice to Tissa Buddha immediately before his Enlightenment.

For his father, etc., see Cv.  Trs.ii.  227, n.1. He succeeded Rājasīha I.  and ruled in Sirivaddhanapura.  He built a temple for the Tooth Relic in the capital* and, having sent an embassy to Rakkhanga, obtained a chapter of monks under Nandicakka to re establish the Order in Ceylon.  He built the Ganthamba vihāra and held there a ceremony of ordination.  He was succeeded by his cousin Senaratna, whom he persuaded to leave the Order that he might assume the duties of kingship (Cv.xciv.6ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* He seems to have made a special casket for the Relics, which Kittisirirājasīha later overlaid with gold; Cv.c.21; Cv.  Trs.ii.276, n.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vimaladhammasūriya.&lt;/b&gt; King of Ceylon (Vimaladhammasūriya II., 1687 1707 A.C.).  He was the son of Rājasīha II.  He held festivals in honour of the Tooth Relic and the Footprint at Sumanakūta and, sending an embassy to Rakkhanga, obtained thirty three monks, headed by Santāna Thera, to reorganize the Order in Ceylon.  He was succeeded by his son, Narindasīha.  Cv.xcvii.1ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Virocana Jātaka (No.  143)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta was once a lion and lived in Kañcanaguhā.  He granted to a jackal the favour of being allowed to inform him of the presence of prey, the animal being given a portion of the carcase in return for this service.  In time the jackal grew strong and begged to be allowed to kill an elephant.  The lion reluctantly agreed to this, but the jackal, in his attempts to leap on to the elephant, missed his aim and fell to the ground where he was crushed to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to Devadatta's attempt to pose as the Buddha and his failure to do so, wherefore he received a kick on the chest from Kokālika (q.v.).  The jackal is identified with Devadatta.  J.i.490-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vīravikkama&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;King of Ceylon (circa 1542 A.C.).  He succeeded Vijayabāhu VI.  and claimed descent from Sirisanghabodhi.  He lived in Sirivaddhanapura (modern Kandy), built eighty six dwelling houses for the monks and had the Tipitaka copied.  He went on a pilgrimage to Mahiyangana and Sumanakūta.  He cultivated a rice field himself, and, from the produce, gave alms.  Cv.xcii.6ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Veyyāvaccaka Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arahant.  Ninety one kappas ago he was a servant to Vipassī Buddha, and, having nothing to give, worshipped his feet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight kappas ago he was a king called Sucintita (Ap.i.138).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Sañjaya Thera.  ThagA.i.120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Velusumana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general of Dutthagāmanī.  He was the son of Vasabha, a householder of Kutumbiyangana in Girijanapada.  When the child was born, two friends of Vasabha, Vela and Sumana, came with gifts, and the boy was given their two names.  When Velusumana grew up, he went to live with Sumana, governor of Girijanapada, and broke in a horse with which everyone else had failed.  Sumana therefore gave him one hundred thousand and sent him to Kākavannatissa's court (Mhv.xxiii.68ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vihāradevī wished to drink water in which had been washed the sword which cut off the head of Nandasārathi, Elāra's chief warrior, Velusumana was entrusted with the task of killing Nandasārathi.  He therefore went to Anurādhapura, where he became friendly with the keeper of the king's state horse, Vāha.  One day he took the horse to bathe in the Kadambanadī, and, after announcing his name, rode away on him.  Elarā sent Nandasārathi in pursuit.  Velusumana stood concealed behind a thicket, on a mound called Nigrodhasāla, with drawn sword, and as Nandasārathi rode past quickly, he was transfixed by Velusumana's sword (Mhv.xxii.51ff.; MT.  440f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velusumana took a prominent part in the capture of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxv.25).  &lt;span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"&gt;See also Ras.ii.6f.  and 97f.  where the details differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vikkamabāhu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vikkamabāhu, Vikkamabhuja, Vikkantabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; Surnames of King Kassapa VI.  See Kassapa (21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vikkamabāhu.  &lt;/b&gt; Son of Vijayabāhu I.  and Tilokasundarī.  He had two wives, Sundarī and Līlāvatī (Cv.lix.32, 49f).  He was made Adipāda by Vijayabāhu I., and, when his son Gajabāhu was born, the king gave the province of Rohana for his welfare.  Vikkamabāhu lived there with Mahānāgahula (Cv.lx.88f) as his capital.  When Vijayabāhu died, some of Vikkamabāhu's relations, Jayabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (Mānābharana, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha) conspired to keep him out of the succession, but he defeated them in various battles and took possession of the capital Pulatthipura, losing, however, Dakkhinadesa and his former province of Rohana (Cv.lxi.2f).  A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by Mānābharana, and, as Vikkamabāhu advanced to Kalyanī to fight them, Vīradeva, of Palandīpa (q.v.) landed in Mannāra, and his attention was diverted.  In the first engagements, Vikkamabāhu was defeated by Vīradeva and forced to flee to Kotthasāra, but Vīradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika.  From then onwards Vikkamabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (see above) lived each in his province, but became unpopular both with the sangha and the laity owing to their greed and lust.  Following the death of Jayabāhu and the Queen Mittā, Vikkamabāhu appears to have been acknowledged king (Vikkamabāhu II.); and it was evidently as such that the birth of his nephew, the prince who after became Parakkamabāhu.  I., was reported to him.  Vikkamabāhu had two sons, Mahinda, and Gajabāhu, but asked that his nephew should be sent to the court; this request, however, was not granted (Cv.lxii.58f).  Vikkamabāhu reigned, till his death, for twenty one years (1116 1137 A.C.), and was succeeded by his son Gajabāhu.  Cv.lxiii.18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vikkamabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; Son of Gajabāhu and brother of Colagangakumāra.  Cv.lxx.238.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vikkamabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; Younger brother of King Kittinissanka.  He became king on the death of Vīrabāhu I., but reigned for only three months (in 1196 A.C.), after which he was slain by Codaganga.  Cv.lxxx.28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vikkamabāhu.&lt;/b&gt; The king who succeeded Parakkamabāhu V.  He was himself succeeded by Bhuvenakabāhu V.  Cv.xci.  1, 3; he seems to have reigned for eighteen years (1347 75 A.C.).  See Cv.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Visuddhi-Magga&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An encyclopedia of the Buddha's teaching, written by Buddhaghosa at the request of Sanghapāla Thera.  It is said (Cv.xxxvii.236) that when Buddhaghosa arrived at the Mahāvihāra and asked permission to translate the Singhalese Commentaries into Pāli, the monks, to test him, gave him two stanzas (quoted at the beginning of the book) on which they asked him to write a thesis.  As soon as he had finished this, the devas hid the copy, and the same thing happened after it was rewritten.  He then rewrote it a third time, and when it was being read in the assembly of monks, the two previous copies suddenly reappeared and were found to agree in every detail with the new one.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a description of the book, see Law, Hist.  of Pāli Lit., ii.399f.  A Commentary on the work exists, called the Paramatthamañjūsa by Dhammāpāla (P.L.C.  113; Svd.1231), and a Visuddhimaggaganthipadattha was written by Sāradassī, a monk of Ava.

Vutthi Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A conversation between two devas and the Buddha's comments thereon.  Of things making for progress, knowledge is the best; ignorance is the greatest worsener; among beings that walk, the Sangha is the best; among declarants, the Buddha is the best.

As he is about to start, a monk reports to the Buddha that Sāriputta has offended him and has not asked his pardon.  (The Commentary (AA.ii.797) explains that the skirt of Sāriputta's robe brushed the Elder; some say the wind blew it without his knowledge.) Sāriputta is sent for and asked to explain; he declares with a wealth of simile that he is free from hatred and ill will; he has nothing but loathing for his body; how then would he offend a brother monk and not ask his pardon? The accuser is convinced of his folly and begs forgiveness.  (A.iv.373ff.; cf.  DhA.ii.178ff., where the story recurs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vimāna Vatthu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya.  It describes the splendour of various celestial abodes belonging to different devas, obtained by them as reward for some meritorious act performed in a previous life.  The stories were learnt from the devas themselves, by Moggallāna, Vangīsa and others, during their sojourn in the deva-worlds, and reported by them to the Buddha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commentary on the work exists by Dhammapāla, forming part of the Paramatthadīpanī, and sometimes called Vimalatthavilāsinī (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories from the Vimāna Vatthu were related by Mahinda in Ceylon in his first sermon to Anulā and her five hundred companions.

He is probably identical with Verocana, lord of the Asuras' who, according to the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.225f), went with Sakka to visit the Buddha during his siesta.  They waited upon the Buddha, leaning against a doorpost, and each uttered two stanzas on the necessity of striving until one's aim is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

According to the Mātanga Jātaka (J.iv.388; cf.  Dvy.  451, 456), Mātanga lived in a hermitage on the upper reaches of the river in order to humble the pride of Jātimanta, who lived lower down.  On the banks of the river was a city, also called Vettavatī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Milinda-pañhā (p.114) the Vettavatī is mentioned as one of the ten chief rivers flowing from the Himālaya.  It is probably identical with the Vetravatī mentioned in Kālidāsa's Meghadūta, and is identified with the modern Betuva in Bhopal (the ancient Vidīsa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vettavatī.&lt;/b&gt; A channel branching off from the Parakkamasamudda; the sluice from which it started bore the same name.  Cv.lxxix.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

(Dpv.vi.15; xii.14, 35; Sp.i.70, 71; Mhv.xiii.6 9,18).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vedisa was fifty yojanas from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/paataliputta_gama,Pātaliputta')"&gt;Pātaliputta&lt;/a&gt; and was founded by the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakya,Sākiyans')"&gt;Sākiyans&lt;/a&gt; who fled from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/viduudabha,Vidūdabha')"&gt;Vidūdabha's&lt;/a&gt; massacre (Mbv., p.  98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vedisa is identified with the modern Bhilsa in Gwalior State, twenty six miles north east of Bhopal.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vuttamālāsandesasataka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pāli poem of the fifteenth century, containing one hundred and two stanzas and written by Upatapassī, who calls himself Sarasigāmamūlamahāsāmī.  It contains laudatory verses on the reigning king, contemporary monks and several places of worship.  The book is supposed to have aimed at teaching students the right pronunciation of sounds and the proper modulation of voice in reciting verses.  P.L.C.  253f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

The Buddha points out to them the advantages of keeping the five precepts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;abstention from taking life, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;from theft, etc., &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoidance of slander, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;harsh speech and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;frivolous talk, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and of having faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vuttodaya&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A work on Pāli prosody, in six chapters, partly prose, partly verse, written by Sangharakkhita Thera of Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is based on works dealing with Sanskrit prosody - e.g., of Pingala - and has borrowed their terms and method of treatment.  There exist several Commentaries on the work, chief of which are the Vuttodaya pañcikā (or Chandosāratthavikāsinī) by Saddhammañāna and Tīkās by Vepullabuddhi of Pagan, and Navavimalabuddhi or Culla vimalabuddhi of Panyā.

Buddhaghosa explains (SNA.ii.482) that this is the name of a mahatā khāraodikā nadī (the great "Caustic River") referred to in the Devadatta Sutta (M.iii.185).  Its waters are sharp and bitter (tinhadhārā, khuradhārā) (SN.  vs.  674; cf.  J.v.269), and the river flows by the Asipattavana.  When beings enter it to bathe and drink (because it looks like a sheet of water) they are hacked by swords and other sharp weapons which stand concealed along the river bank.  (SNA.ii.482; J.v.275; vi.  105; where a long description is given of the horrors of Vetaranī.) Sometimes Vetaranī is used in a general way to indicate Niraya.  (As "desanāsīsa” - e.g.  J.iii.473; SA.i.48; cf.  J.iv.273).  Those guilty of abortion are reborn in the Vetaranīnadī (J.v.269), as are also oppressors of the weak (J.vi.106).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Vetambarī.  &lt;/b&gt; One of a group of devas who visited the Buddha at Veluvana and spoke of their beliefs.  Vetambarī spoke two verses, one condemning asceticism, and the other, which followed immediately on the first, in praise of the same (S.i.65, 67).  The Commentary says (SA.i.100) that the second verse was inspired by Māra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Along this road Asoka travelled bearing the Bodhi tree (Mhv.xix.6; Dpv.xvi.2).  This was also the road leading from Ceylon to Pātaliputta (Dpv.xv.87).  Near the forest was a great monastery from which sixty thousand monks, led by Uttara, went to attend the Foundation Ceremony of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xx.ix.40).  At the foot of the mountain was a market town named Munda.  DhA.iv.128 ; elsewhere, however e.g.  Sp.iii.655, Viñjhātavi is described as agāmakam araññam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forest was the abode of petas.

A.iii.204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vera Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Preached to Anāthapindika on the advantages of getting rid of the fivefold dread (given in Sutta 1 above).

The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, saw this, and, assuming the form of a parrot, visited them and sang the praises of the ascetic life.  They expressed their joy at being thus praised, but the parrot went on to make them understand that their lives were useless; they were mere refuse eaters and not ascetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the monks mentioned in the Pāsādakampana Sutta (q.v.).  The monks are identified with the seven ascetics.  J.iii.310f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Venāga Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preached at Venāgapura.  The brahmins of that village visit the Buddha, and their leader Vacchagotta expresses his admiration of the Buddha's translucent colour in various similes, suggesting that it may be due to the luxurious beds on which the Buddha is able to sleep.  The Buddha, however, answers that the costly beds mentioned by Vacchagotta are not for recluses like himself, but that he has three different "couches," each of which gives him great comfort of body and mind: the broad celestial (dibba) couch, the sublime couch, and the Ariyan couch.  He explains the nature of these couches and of the four jhānas.  The Venāgapura brahmins thereupon accept the Buddha as their teacher.  A.i.180ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vinīlak Jātaka (No.  160)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A golden goose once paired with a crow and they had a son of blue black hue, whom they called Vinīlaka.  The goose had two sons, and they, noticing that their father often went to Mithilā to see Vinīlaka, offered to go and fetch him.  They perched Vinīlaka on a stick and dew with the ends of the stick in their beaks.  As they flew over Mithilā, Vinīlaka saw King Videha (the Bodhisatta) riding in his state chariot and boasted that Videha was no better off than he himself, since he was being carried by a pair of golden geese.  The geese, in their anger, wished to drop him, but took him on to their father and told him of his son's words.  The goose was very angry on hearing this and sent Vinilaka home to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to an attempt by Devadatta, at Gayāsīsa, to imitate the Buddha when he was visited by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinīlaka is identified with Devadatta.

One day Kassapa saw him being led to execution for some crime and asked him to recall the meditation which, in former days, had enabled him to gain the Fourth Jhāna.  The man did so and was without fear.  The executioners, finding him unconcerned with their punishments of him, took him to the king who, after enquiry, released him.  Later he visited the Buddha and became an arahant.  DhA.iv.52f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Vesāli Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Buddha once addressed the monks on the great benefits of meditating on asubha, and then retired into solitude in the Mahāvana for a fortnight.  The monks, filled with the idea of asubha, felt loathing for their bodies and many committed suicide.  The Buddha hearing of this, summoned the monks to the Kūtāgārasālā and taught them the great merits of concentration on breathing.  S.v.320f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He was born in the pleasance of Anoma (Commentary, Anūpama), his father being the khattiya Suppatita (Supatita) and his mother Yasavatī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day of his birth he roared "like a bull" a shout of triumph, hence his name (vasabhanādahetuttā).  (But MT.  63 gives another explanation: hīnam janānam abhibhūto maggena abhibhavitakilesahīno ti vā.  Dvy.333 calls him Visvabhū).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For six thousand years he lived in the household in three palaces: Ruci, Suruci and Vaddhana (Rativaddhana); his wife was Sucittā, and their son Suppabuddha.  He left home in a golden palanquin, practiced austerities for six months, was given milk rice by Sirivaddhanā of Sucittanigama, and grass for his seat by the Nāga king Narinda, and attained Enlightenment under a sāla tree.  He preached his first sermon at Anurārāma to his brothers, Sona and Uttara, who became his chief disciples.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women his chief disciples were Dāmā and Samālā, his constant attendant Upasanta (Upasannaka), his chief lay patrons Sotthika and Rāma among men, and Gotamī (Kāligotamī) and Sirimā among women.  He was sixty cubits in height and lived for sixty thousand years.  He died at the Khemārāma in Usabhavatī and his relics were scattered.  The Bodhisatta was King Sudassana of Sarabhavatī.  (Bu.xxii.1ff.; BuA.205ff.; D.ii.5.; J.i.41).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessabhū Buddha kept the uposatha once in every six years.  DhA.iii.236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Vidhūrapandita.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four kings &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dhanañjaya Korabba, king of Indapatta; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sakka, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Nāga king Varuna, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venateyya king of the Supannas &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;having taken the uposatha-vows, meet together in a garden and there have a dispute as to which of them is the most virtuous.  They cannot decide among themselves and agree, therefore, to refer the matter to Dhanañjaya's minister, Vidhurapandita (the Bodhisatta).  The minister listens to the claims of each and then declares that all are equal; their virtues are like the spokes of a wheel.  They are pleased, and Sakka gives the minister a silk robe, Varuna a jewel, the Supanna king a golden garland, and Dhanañjaya one thousand cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vimalā, Varuna's wife, hearing from her husband of Vidhura's wisdom, is so enchanted that she yearns to see him, and in order to do so feigns illness, and says that she must have Vidhura's heart.  Varuna's daughter, Irandatī, is offered to anyone who can get possession of Vidhura's heart, and the Yakkha Punnaka, nephew of Vessavana, who sees her and is fascinated by her beauty, accepts the condition.  He obtains Vessavana's consent by a ruse and visits Dhanañjaya's court.  There he challenges the king to a game of dice, giving his name as Kaccāyana, and offers as stake his wonderful steed and all seeing gem, provided the king will offer Vidhura as his.  Dhanañaya agrees, plays and loses.  Vidhura agrees to go with Punnaka; the king asks him questions regarding the householder's life for his own guidance, and Vidhura is given three days' leave to visit his family.  Having taken leave of them, he goes with Punnaka.  On the way Punnaka tries in vain to kill him by frightening him.  When Vidhura discovers Punnaka's intention, he preaches to him as he sits on the top of the Kālapabbata, and the Yakkha is so moved that he offers to take Vidhura back to Indapatta.  But in spite of his protestations, Vidhura insists on going on to the Nāga world.  They arrive in Varuna's abode; Vidhura preaches first to Varuna and then to Vimalā.  They are both delighted, and Punnaka wins the hand of Irandatī.  In his great joy Punnaka gives Vidhura his marvellous jewel and takes him back to Indapatta.  There Vidhura relates his adventures and gives the jewel to the king.  A festival lasting one month is held in honour of Vidhura's return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to the Buddha's wisdom.  Vidhura's chief wife, Anujjā, is identified with Rāhulamātā; his eldest son, Dhammapāla, with Rāhula; Varuna with Sāriputta; the Supanna king with Moggallāna; Sakka with Anuruddha, and Dhanañjaya with Ananda (J.vi.255-329).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jātaka is also referred to as the Punnaka Jātaka (E.g., J.iv.14, 182).  Four scenes from the Jātaka are found on the Bharhut Tope.  Cunningham, Bharhut, p.82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

But, in answer to his question, the hermit asked him another, and the pilgrim was forced to retire discomfited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related in reference to a Paribbājaka who came to Sāvatthi to debate with the Buddha, but who was forced to own defeat.  The two disputants were identical.  J.ii.257f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Visārada Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; A man who takes life takes what is not given, is given over to lust, lies, and takes spirituous liquors, such a man lives as a layman without confidence.  Following the opposite course, he lives with confidence.  A.iii.203; cf.  No.  3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Visārada Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Five things that give confidence to a woman: beauty, wealth, kindred, sons and virtue.  S.iv.246.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Visārada Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; A woman who abstains from taking life, theft, sensual lusts, lying and intoxicants, lives in confidence.  S.iv.250; cf.  No.  1 above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Veludvāra&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin village of the Kosalans where the Buddha once stayed and preached the Veludvāreyya Sutta (S.v.352).  Buddhaghosa says (SA.iii.217) that the place was so called owing to the tradition of the presence of a bamboo thicket at the entrance to the village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vimalakondañña Thera&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Ambapālī and Bimbisāra.  Vimala was his earlier name, but later he came to be called Vimalakondañña.  When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Vimala was impressed by his majesty and entered the Order, attaining arahantship soon afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a rich householder, and one day, being present while the Buddha preached to a large number of people, he rejoiced so much that he offered him four golden flowers.  The Buddha, by his magic power, caused the golden hue of the flowers to pervade the whole region.  Vimala died soon after and was reborn in Tusita.  Forty three kappas ago he became king sixteen times under the name of Nemī.  ThagA.i.145f.; a verse containing a riddle and ascribed to Vimala is given in Thag.  vs.  64. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sermon preached by Vimala helped Ambapālī to develop insight and win arahantship.  ThigA.  207.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vessavana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the names of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kuvera,Kuvera')"&gt;Kuvera&lt;/a&gt;, given to him because his kingdom is called Visānā (D.iii.201; SNA.i.369, etc.).  He is one of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/caatummahaaraajikaa,Cātummahārājāno')"&gt;Cātummahārājāno&lt;/a&gt; and rules over the Yakkhas, his kingdom being in the north (E.g., D.ii.207).  In the Ātānātiya Sutta he is the spokesman, and he recited the Ātānātiya-rune for the protection of the Buddha and his followers from the Yakkhas who had no faith in the Buddha.  D.iii.194; he was spokesman because "he was intimate with the Buddha, expert in conversation, well trained" (DA.iii.962).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rides in the Nārīvāhana, which is twelve yojanas long, its seat being of coral.  His retinue is composed of ten thousand crores of Yakkhas.  (SNA.i.379; the preacher's seat in the Lohapāsāda at Anurādhapura was made in the design of the Nārīvāhana, Mhv.xxvii.29).  He is a sotāpanna and his life span is ninety thousand years (AA.ii.718).  The books record a conversation between him and Velukantakī Nandamāta (q.v.), when he heard her sing the Parāyana Vagga and stayed to listen.  When Cūlasubhaddā wished to invite the Buddha and his monks to her house in Sāketa, and felt doubtful about it, Vessavana appeared before her and said that the Buddha would come at her invitation (AA.ii.483).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On another occasion (A.iv.162; on his way to see the Buddha) he heard Uttara Thera preaching to the monks in Dhavajālikā on the Sankheyya Mountain, near Mahisavatthu, and went and told Sakka, who visited Uttara and had a discussion with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once when Vessavana was travelling through the air, he saw Sambhūta Thera wrapt in samādhi.  Vessavana descended from his chariot, worshipped the Thera, and left behind two Yakkhas with orders to wait until the Elder should emerge from his trance.  The Yakkhas then greeted the Thera in the name of Vessavana and told him they had been left to protect him.  The Elder sent thanks to Vessavana, but informed him, through the Yakkhas, that the Buddha had taught his disciples to protect themselves through mindfulness, and so further protection was not needed.  Vessavana visited Sambhūta on his return, and finding that the Elder had become an arahant, went to Sāvatthi and carried the news to the Buddha.  ThagA.i.46f.  Just as he encouraged the good, so he showed his resentment against the wicked; see, e.g., Revatī.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention is made of Vessavana's Gadāvudha* and his mango tree, the Atulamba**.  Alavaka's abode was near that of Vessavana (SNA.i.240).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SNA.i.225; the books (e,g., SA.i.249; Sp.ii.440) are careful to mention that he used his Gadāvudha only while he was yet a puthujjana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;** J.iv.324, also called Abbhantaramba (see the Abbharantara Jātaka).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimbisāra, after death, was born seven times as one of the ministers (paricaraka) of Vessavana, and, while on his way with a message from Vessavana to Virūlhaka, visited the Buddha and gave him an account of a meeting of the devas which Vessavana had attended and during which Sanankumāra had spoken in praise of the Buddha and his teachings (D.ii.206f).  Vessavana seems to have been worshipped by those desiring children.  See, e.g., the story of Rājadatta (ThagA.i.403).  There was in Anurādhapura a banyan tree dedicated as a shrine to Vessavana in the time of Pandukābhaya (Mhv.x.89).  Vessavana is mentioned as having been alive in the time of Vipassī Buddha.  When Vipassī died, there was a great earthquake which terrified the people, but Vessavana appeared and quieted their fears (ThagA.i.149).  Vessavana accompanied Sakka when he showed Moggallāna round Vejayanta pāsāda.  M.i.253; because he was Sakka's very intimate friend (MA.i.476).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As lord of the Yakkhas, it was in the power of Vessavana to grant to any of them special privileges, such as the right of devouring anyone entering a particular pond, etc.  See, e.g., DhA.iii.74; J.i.128; iii.325 (Makhādeva).  Sometimes, e.g., in the case of Avaruddhaka (DhA.ii.237), a Yakkha had to serve Vessavana for twelve years in order to obtain a particular boon (cf.  J.ii.16,17).  (Three years at J.iii.502.) Vessavana some times employs the services of uncivilized human beings (paccantamilakkhavāsika) DA.iii.865f.  The Yakkhas fear him greatly.  If he is angry and looks but once, one thousand Yakkhas are broken up and scattered "like parched peas hopping about on a hot plate" (J.ii.399).  This was probably before he became a sotāpanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana, like Sakka, was not the name of a particular being, but of the holder of an office.  When one Vessavana died, Sakka chose another as his successor.  The new king, on his accession, sent word to all the Yakkhas, asking them to choose their special abodes (J.i.328).  It was the duty of Yakkhinīs to fetch water from Anotatta for Vessavana's use.  Each Yakkhinī served her turn, sometimes for four, sometimes for five months.  But sometimes they died from exhaustion before the end of their term.  (DhA.i.40; also J.iv.492; v.21).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vessavana's wife was Bhuñjatī (q.v.), who, like himself, was a devoted follower of the Buddha (D.ii.270).  They had five daughters: Latā, Sajjā, Pavarā, Acchimatī, and Sutā.  For a story about them, see VvA.131f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punnaka was Vessavana's nephew.  J.vi.265, 326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pleasures and luxuries enjoyed by Vessavana have become proverbial.  See, e.g., Vv.iv.  3, 46 (bhuñjāmi kāmakāmī rājā Vessavano yathā); MT.  676 (Vessavanassa rājaparihārasadisam); cf.  J.vi.313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ascetic named Kañcanapatti (J.ii.399) is mentioned as having been the favourite of Vessavana.  See also Yakkha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vepullabuddhi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monk of Pagan of the fourteenth century; author of tīkās on the Vuttodaya, the Saddasāratthajālini, the Abhidhammattha-Sangaha, and the Vidadhimukhamandana.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was author also of the Paramatthamañjūsa and the Vacanatthajotī.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vinaya Pitaka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the three divisions of the Tipitaka.  It contains rules and regulations for the conduct of monks and nuns in all the details of their lives.  The rules are attributed to the Buddha himself, and an old commentary, incorporated into the text, gives accounts of the occasions on which the rules were formulated.  A certain amount of historical matter is also found regarding the Order, especially in the last two chapters of the Cullavagga.  &lt;p&gt;The Vinaya Pitaka consists of &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vibhanga,Sutta-Vibhanga')"&gt;Sutta-Vibhanga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Khandhakas, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the Parivāra, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pa/patimokkha,Pātimokkha')"&gt;Pātimokkha&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is divided into &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pārājikā and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pācittiya &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and the second into &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahavagga,Mahāvagga')"&gt;Mahāvagga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cullavagga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vihāradevī&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wife of Kākavannatissa and mother of Dutthagāmanī and Saddhātissa.  She was the daughter of Tissa, king of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kalyaanii,Kalyānī')"&gt;Kalyānī&lt;/a&gt; and was cast adrift in a boat on the ocean in order to appease the sea gods in their wrath against Tissa for having killed an arahant.  Her name was Devī, but because she came ashore near the monastery of Tolaka (?) (This is probably the correct reading of the name; see MT.  432) she was called Vihāradevī (Mhv.xxii.20ff).  When with her first child, she longed to eat a honeycomb one usabha in length and to drink the water in which had been washed the sword used in cutting off the head of Nandasārathī, chief of Elāra's warriors (Mhv.42ff.; MT.  441).  When she was the second time with child, she wished to lie under a campaka tree in bloom and inhale its fragrance (MT.443).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her husband died, Saddhātissa carried her off, hoping thus to win the kingdom, but she was later restored to Dutthagāmanī.  She was wise and practical and helped in Dutthagāmanī's campaigns, especially in the capture of Ambatittha and Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxv.9, 55).  We know nothing of her later history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Velāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bodhisatta born as the chaplain of Benares.  He was son of the preceding chaplain, and went with the crown prince to Takkasilā to study.  There, in due course, he became a famous teacher, with eighty four thousand princes among his pupils.  Later, he became chaplain to the Benares king.  Every year the eighty four thousand princes came to Benares to pay their respects to the king, causing great suffering to the people.  These complained to the king, and he asked Velāma to find a way out of the difficulty.  Velāma marked out eighty four thousand provinces for the princes, and, thereafter, they obtained their supplies from their respective dominions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velāma was exceedingly wealthy and wished to give alms.  Therefore, turning his water jar upside down, he wished that if there were holy men in the world, the water should flow downwards.  The water, however, remained in the jar.  He then discovered by the same means that his gifts would be free from blame.  He thereupon held great almsgivings, distributing during seven years the seven precious things and gifts of great value, pouring forth his riches as though "making into one stream the five great rivers." A list of his gifts is found at A.iv.393f.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velāma's story is given in AA.ii.802ff.; it is referred to in the Velāma Sutta and in the introductory story to the Khadirangāra Jātaka (q.v.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velāma's almsgiving became famous in literature as the Velāmamahāyañña.  E.g., MA.ii.616.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vijayārāma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A garden in Anurādhapura, through which the boundary of the Mahāvihāra passed (Mbv.  p.  136).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A monastery was built there (probably later), which came to be called the Vijayārāma-vihāra.  Once, an arahant monk, teaching a kammatthāna to two monks, spoke of samuddha instead of samudda.  One of the monks pointed out his error, and was sent by the arahant to the Mahāvihāra with a message that he had paid more attention to letters than to their meaning.  The monk went to the Mahāvihāra and later attained Nibbāna, after solving various difficult questions in the presence of the assembly.  MA.ii.827.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

Vethadīpaka.&lt;/b&gt; The brahmin of Vethadīpa, who claimed an eighth share of the Buddha's relics.  D.ii.165, 167.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vethadīpaka.&lt;/b&gt; The king of Vethadīpa and friend of the king of Allakappa.  They left the world together and became ascetics in the Himālaya.  Vethadīpaka died and was reborn in the deva world.  He then visited his friend, and, learning that he had been troubled by elephants, taught him a charm to ward off any harm which might come from them.  This charm Udena later learnt from Allakappa.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Velukanda, Velukanta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A city in Avanti, birthplace of Nanda Kumāputta (ThagA.i.100).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moggallāna and Sāriputta visited the place in the course of a journey in Dakkhināgiri and were entertained by Nandamātā (A.iv.62f).  See Velukantakī.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.717; SNA.i.370) that the city was so called because bamboos were thickly planted for protection round the walls and fortifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

J.vi.251.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vessāmitta.&lt;/b&gt; A Yakkha chief who, with five hundred others of the same name, was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta.  D.ii.257.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is mentioned among the Yakkha chiefs to be invoked in time of need by followers of the Buddha (D.iii.205).  Buddhaghosa says he was so called because he lived on a mountain called Vessāmitta.  DA.ii.686; iii.970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vethadīpa, Vethadīpaka&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brahmin settlement, the chieftain of which claimed a part of the Buddha's relics; having obtained the relics, he built at thūpa over them (D.ii.165, 167; Bu.xxviii.3).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dhammapada Commentary, the kings of Vethadīpaka and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/am/allakappa,Allakappa')"&gt;Allakappa&lt;/a&gt; once lived intimate friendship.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Videha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Videha.  &lt;/b&gt; A setthi in the time of Padumuttara Buddha.  He was a previous birth of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_kassapa_th,Mahā Kassapa')"&gt;Mahā Kassapa&lt;/a&gt;.  His wife was Bhaddā Kāpilānī in this age.  Ap.ii.578.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Videha, Videhā.&lt;/b&gt; A country and its people.  At the time of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/buddha,Buddha')"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, Videha formed one of the two important principalities of the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/va/vajjii,Vajjian')"&gt;Vajjian&lt;/a&gt; confederacy.  Its capital was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/me_mu/mithilaa,Mithilā')"&gt;Mithilā&lt;/a&gt;.  The kingdom bordered on the Ganges, on one side of which was &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ma/magadha,Magadha')"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt; and on the other Videha (See, e.g., M.i.225; MA.i.448).  Adjacent to it were &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ka/kaasi,Kāsi')"&gt;Kāsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kosala,Kosala')"&gt;Kosala&lt;/a&gt;.  In the&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara_jat_406,Gandhāra Jātaka')"&gt;Gandhāra Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; (J.iii.365; iv.  316) the kingdom of Videha is said to have been three hundred leagues in extent, with sixteen thousand villages, well filled storehouses and sixteen thousand dancing girls.  Videha was a great trade centre, and mention is made (PvA.227) of merchants coming from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saavatthi,Sāvatthi')"&gt;Sāvatthi&lt;/a&gt; to sell their wares in Videha.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/s/suruci_jat_489,Suruci Jātaka')"&gt;Suruci Jātaka&lt;/a&gt; seems to show that a close connection existed between Videha and Benares.  In the Buddha's time, one of Bimbisāra's queens was probably from Videha (see &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/vy/vedehiputta,Vedehiputta')"&gt;Vedehiputta&lt;/a&gt;).  Mention is also made (MA.i.534) of a friendship existing between the kings of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/g/gandhaara,Gandhāra')"&gt;Gandhāra&lt;/a&gt; and Videha.  In earlier times Videha was evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahajanaka,Mahājanaka')"&gt;Mahājanaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/n/nimi,Nimi')"&gt;Nimi&lt;/a&gt;; but in the Buddha's time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation.  According to the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/mahagovinda_s,Mahāgovinda Sutta')"&gt;Mahāgovinda Sutta&lt;/a&gt; (D.ii.235), it was King&lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/r/renu,Renu')"&gt;Renu&lt;/a&gt; who, with the help of &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/j/jotipaala,Mahāgovinda Jotipāla')"&gt;Mahāgovinda Jotipāla&lt;/a&gt;, founded the Videha kingdom.  The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) state that Videha was colonized by the inhabitants, who were brought from &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/pu/pubbavideha,Pubbavideha')"&gt;Pubbavideha&lt;/a&gt; by King Mandhātā.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Satapatha Brāhmana (I.iv.1), however, ascribes the kingdom to Māthava the Videgha, and gives as its boundaries Kausikī in the east, the Ganges to the south, the Sadārūra in the west, and the Himālaya in the north.  In the centre of Videha was Pabbatarattha, in which was the city Dhammakonda, the residence of Dhaniya.  (SNA.i.26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strainer used by the Buddha was honoured, after his death, by the people of Videha (Bu.xxviii.11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uruvela Kassapa was, in a previous birth, king of Videha (Ap.ii.483).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

They gave but little milk, through fear of a lion living in the forest.  The merchant, knowing that the lion loved a doe, had her caught and her body rubbed with poison.  When she returned to the forest, the lion licked her body and died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha related this story to the monks to show them the necessity for circumspection in accepting gifts.

Having one day seen Moggallāna begging in Vesāli for alms, she went to his dwelling and tried to entice him.  Some say, adds the Commentator, that she was influenced by the heretics.  The incident is referred to at ThagA.ii.178, but Vimalā's name is not given.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elder rebuked and admonished her, and she became a lay follower and later entered the Order.  There after great effort, she became an arahant.  ThigA.76f.; her Udāna verses are included in Thig.vs.72-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedabbha Jātaka (No.  48)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was once a brahmin who knew the Vedabbha charm which, if repeated at a certain conjunction of the planets, made the seven precious things rain down from the sky.  The Bodhisatta was his pupil, and one day, while journeying in the forest, they were attacked by five hundred robbers called "despatchers" (pesankacorā).  They were so called because when they took two prisoners they would keep one, sending the other for ransom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These robbers kept the brahmin and sent the Bodhisatta for the ransom.  The Bodhisatta, knowing that that night the conjunction of the stars would occur, which ensured the efficacy of the charm, warned the brahmin not to make use of it.  But when night came the brahmin repeated the charm, and the robbers were so delighted that he was able to persuade them to set him free.  They set off with the treasures that had fallen from the sky, the brahmin accompanying them, but on the way they were attacked by another robber band.  These were told that the brahmin could make treasures fall from the sky; they were therefore set free, only the brahmin being kept back.  But on being told that they must wait for one year for the necessary conjunction of planets, they were angry, cut the brahmin in two, and pursued the first band of robbers, destroying them entirely.  Unable to agree on the division of the spoils which they thus obtained, the second band fought among themselves till only two were left.  These took the treasure and hid it in a jungle near the village.  One guarded it while the other went to the village for rice.  When he returned he cooked the rice, ate his share, and put poison in the rest hoping thus to rid himself of his companion; the latter, however, killed him, then ate the rice and died himself.  The Bodhisatta returning with the ransom, found all the dead bodies, in various places, and realized what had happened.  He took the treasure to his own house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to a self willed monk who is identified with the Vedabbha brahmin.  J.i.253 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

He developed the habit of sleeping by day and suffered from biliousness.  This made him realize his folly, and, developing insight, he became a Pacceka Buddha.

He learnt, on enquiry, that these animals were attracted by his music, and ordered that they should be fed regularly.  On finding that some of them failed to appear, he made arrangements for a drum to be sounded at the feeding time.  Later, finding that a crocodile came and ate some of the fish, the king ordered him to be harpooned.  The crocodile escaped capture, but died soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was related to a backsliding monk.  Desire always leads to suffering, said the Buddha; it was desire that caused the death of the crocodile.  J.ii.227f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>

(For details see Mhv.xxxvi.33f ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On days when the Ariyavamsa was being read, he held almsgiving throughout Ceylon.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suppressed the Vetulya heresy with the help of his minister Kapila.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Veluvana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Veluvana.  &lt;/b&gt; A park near Rājagaha, the pleasure garden of Bimbisāra.  When the Buddha first visited Rājagaha, after his Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyāna (Vin.i.35).  The day after his arrival, he accepted the king's invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live "not too far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to seclusion" decided on Veluvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and the fraternity.  This was the first ārāma accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was passed allowing monks to accept such an ārāma.  Vin.i.39f.; according to BuA.  (19; cf.  ApA.i.75) the earth trembled when the water - poured over the Buddha's hand by Bimbisāra in dedication of Veluvana - fell on the earth.  This was the only ārāma in Jambudīpa, the dedication of which was accompanied by a tremor of the earth.  It was the dedication of Veluvana which was quoted as precedent by Mahinda, when he decided to accept the Mahāmeghavana, at Anurādhapura, from Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xv.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during this stay that Sāriputta and Moggallāna joined the Order.  Vin.i.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalandakanivāpa (q.v.) is the place nearly always mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veluvana.  There many Vinaya rules were passed - e.g., on the keeping of the vassa (Vin.i.137), the use of food cooked in the monastery (Vin.i.210f), the picking of edible (kappiya) fruit in the absence of any layman from whom permission to do so could be obtained (Vin.i.212), surgical operations on monks (Vin.i.215f), the eating of sugar (Vin.i.226), the rubbing of various parts of the body against wood (Vin.ii.105), the use of the kinds of dwelling (Vin.ii.146) and the use of gold and silver (Vin.ii.196).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddha's stay at Veluvana, Dabba Mallaputta, at his own request, was appointed regulator of lodgings and apportioner of rations, (Vin.ii.74. The Buddha was at Veluvana when Dabba also decided to die.  He went there to take leave of the Buddha, Ud.viii.9) and Sāriputta and Moggallāna brought back the five hundred monks whom Devadatta had enticed away to Gayāsīsa (Vin.ii.200).  The Buddha spent the second, third, and fourth vassas at Veluvana.  BuA.3; it was while the Buddha was at Veluvana that Devadatta attempted to kill him by causing Nālāgiri to be let loose against him (J.v.335).  It was a very peaceful place, and monks, who had taken part in the first Convocation, rested there, in Kalandakanivāpa, after their exertions.  It was there that they met Purāna, who refused to acknowledge the authenticity of their Recital (Vin.ii.289f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous Jātakas were recited at Veluvana - e.g., Asampadāna, Upahāna, Ubhatobhattha, Kandagalaka, Kālabāhu, Kukkuta, Kumbhila, Kurunga, Kurungamiga, Giridanta, Guttila, Culladhammapāla, Cūlahamsa, Cūlanandiya, Jambu, Tayodhamma, Thusa, Dummedha, Dūbhiyamakkata, Dhammaddhaja, Nigrodha, Parantapa, Pucimanda, Mangala, Manicora, Manoja, Mahākapi, Mahāhamsa, Mūsika, Romaka, Rohantamiga, Ruru, Lakkhana, Latukika, Vānara, Vānarinda, Vinīlaka, Virocana, Saccankura, Sañjīva, Sabbadātha, Sarabhanga, Sāliya, Sigāla, Sīlavanāga, Suvannakakkata, Hamsa and Hāritamātā.  Most of these refer to Devadatta, some to Ajātasattu, and some to Ananda's attempt to sacrifice his life for the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books mention, in addition, various suttas which were preached there.  Among those who visited the Buddha at Veluvana were several devaputtas: Dīghalattha, Nandana, Candana, Sudatta, Subrahmā, Asama, Sahali, Ninka, Akotaka, Vetambari and Mānavagāmiya; also the Dhanañjanī brahmin; the Bhāradvājas: Akkosaka, Asurinda, Bilangika, Aggika, Acela Kassapa, Susīma; the thirty monks from Pāvā (S.ii.187); Theras, like Mahākappina Aññākondañña (just before his death); Sonagahapatiputta, Samiddhi, Moliya Sīvaka, Tālaputa, Manicūlaka, Mahācunda (during his illness), (S.v.181) Visākha (after his visit to Dhammadīnnā, who preached to him the Culla Vedalla Sutta), Abhayarājakumāra, Gulissāni, Vacchagotta, Bhūmija, Samiddhi, Aciravata, Sabhiya, Vassaka, Suppabuddha, Pilindavaccha, Jānussoni and the princess Cundī; also Bimbisāra's wife, Khemā, who went to Veluvana because she had heard so much of its beauty.  Sāriputta and Ananda visited the Buddha there on several occasions, sometimes alone, sometimes in the company of others, and Ananda lived there for some time after the Buddha's death, and during his stay there preached the Gopakamoggallāna Sutta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sāriputta is mentioned as having held discussions there with, among others, Candikāputta and Lāludāyī.  A sermon preached by Mahā Kassapa to the monks at Veluvana is given at A.v.161ff.; for other suttas preached by the Buddha, see also S.i.231; ii.32, 183, 242, 254; iv.20; v.446; Ud.iv.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that Māra visited Veluvana several times (E.g., S.i.106f ) in order to work his will on the Buddha.  The Buddha was there when three of the monks committed suicide - Vakkali, Godhika and Channa - and he had to pronounce them free from blame.  News was brought to the Buddha, at Veluvana, of the illness of three of his disciples - Assaji, Moggallāna and Dīghāvu - and he set out to visit them and comfort them with talks on the doctrine.  Near Veluvana was a Paribbājaka Rāma, where the Buddha sometimes went with some of his disciples in the course of his alms rounds.  Two of his discussions there are recorded in the Cūla- and Mahā Sakuladāyī Suttas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Buddha's lifetime, two thūpas were erected at the gate of Veluvana, one containing the relics of Aññā Kondañña (SA.i.219), and the other those of Moggallāna (J.v.127).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veluvana was so called because it was surrounded by bamboos (velu).  It was surrounded by a wall, eighteen cubits high, holding a gateway and towers (SNA.ii.419; Sp.iii.576).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Buddha's death, Dāsaka, Upāli's pupil, lived at Veluvana, and there ordained Sonaka with fifty five companions.  From there Sonaka went to the Kukkutārāma.  (Mhv.v.115 f, 122; Dpv.iv.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dedication of Veluvana was among the scenes depicted in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.80).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one side of the main building of the Veluvana vihāra was a building called Ambalatthika (MA.ii.635).  There was also a senāsana, built for the use of monks practising austerities (MA.ii.932).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that, after death, Vassakāra was born as a monkey in Veluvana and answered to his name.  He had been told during his lifetime that this destiny awaited him, and therefore took the precaution of seeing that the place was well supplied with fruit trees (MA.ii.854).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hiouen Thsang (Beal, op.  cit., ii.159), the Kalandaka nivāpa (Karandavenuvana, as he calls it) lay one li to the north of Rājagaha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Veluvana.  &lt;/b&gt; A bamboo grove in Kajangalā, where the Buddha once stayed.  The upāsakas of Kajangalā, having questioned the Kajangalā-Bhikkhunī, went to the Buddha there and asked him to verify her answers.  A.v.54f&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Veluvana.  &lt;/b&gt; A bamboo grove in Kimbilā, where the Buddha stayed and was visited by Kimbila.  A.iii.247, 339: iv.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Veluvana.&lt;/b&gt; A monastery in Ceylon, built by Aggabodhi II.  It was given by him to the Sāgalikas (Cv.xlii.43).  It probably lay between Anurādhapura and Manihīra, and Sanghatissa once lay in hiding there disguised as a monk (Cv.xliv.29; Cv.Trs.i.77, n.2).  Jetthatissa III.  gave to the vihāra the village of Kakkalavitthi.  Cv.xliv.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Veluvana.&lt;/b&gt; A monastery erected by Parakkamabāhu I.  in the suburb of Vijita in Pulatthipura.  It consisted of three image houses, each three storeys high, a thūpa, a cloister, a two storeyed pāsāda, four gateways, four long pāsādas, eight small ones, one refectory, one sermon hall, seven fire hoses and twelve privies.

  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vetullavāda&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heretical doctrine which was introduced into Ceylon by Vohārika Tissa, but was suppressed by his minister Kapila (Mhv.xxxvi.41; Dpv.xxii.40).  It appeared again later, and though officially disapproved, it does seem to have pushed its way among the monks of Ceylon, chiefly the Dhammarucikas (q.v.).  E.g., in the reigns of Gothabhaya (Mhv.xxxvi.111), Mahāsena, (xxxvii.1ff.), and Aggabodhi I.  (Cv.xlii.35).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vetullavāda is generally identified with the Mahāyāna school of Buddhism.  See Mhv.  Trs.  259, n.2; also Hocart, Memoirs of the Archaeol.  Survey of Ceylon, i.1922, p.15ff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vetulla Pitaka, the canon of the Vetullavādins, is condemned as abuddhavacana.  E.g., SA.ii.150; cf.

Thirty one kappas ago he met Sikhī Buddha and offered him a vincla flower.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty nine kappas ago he was a king named Sumeghaghana (Ap.i.203f).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is probably identical with Rāmaneyya Thera.  v.l.

As in the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/c/cuula_sakuladaayi_s,Culla Sakuladāyī Suttas')"&gt;Culla Sakuladāyī Suttas&lt;/a&gt;, the Buddha says that what Vekhanassa defines as perfection is merely a refinement of pleasure, and that only arahants can grasp the real meaning of perfection.  Vekhanassa is annoyed, but the Buddha soothes him, and he becomes the Buddha's follower (M.ii.40ff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sutta Vekhanassa is called Kaccāna.  The Commentary (MA.ii.716) says that Vekhanassa visited the Buddha because he wished to discover for himself why his favourite pupil, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/sakuladaayii,Sakuludāyī')"&gt;Sakuludāyī&lt;/a&gt;, should have been defeated by the Buddha; he, therefore, travelled all the way from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, a distance of forty five leagues, to see the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vyaggha Jātaka (No.  272)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/b/bodhisatta,Bodhisatta')"&gt;Bodhisatta&lt;/a&gt; was once a tree sprite and lived near another tree sprite.  No one dared to enter the forest, fearing a lion and a tiger who roamed about there.  So the people could not collect wood.  One day the second tree sprite assumed an awful shape, in spite of the Bodhisatta's advice, and frightened away the lion and the tiger.  The people, finding that they had disappeared, began cutting down the trees.  Then the foolish tree sprite tried in vain to bring the animals back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was told in reference to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/ku/kokaalika,Kokālika')"&gt;Kokālika's&lt;/a&gt; attempt to bring &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/sa/saariputta,Sāriputta')"&gt;Sāriputta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/maha/maha_moggallana_th,Moggallāna')"&gt;Moggallāna&lt;/a&gt; back, after having insulted them.  Kokālika is identified with the foolish sprite, Sāriputta with the lion, and Moggallāna with the tiger.  J.ii.356 8; cf.  the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="DPPNXML('dppn/t/takkaariya_jat_481,Takkāriya Jātaka')"&gt;Takkāriya Jātaka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vepacitti (or Khanti) Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vepacitti is led in bonds to Sakka, whom he abuses.  Sakka remains silent till the departure of Vepacitti.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in reply to Mātali, Sakka says that the man who, when reviled, does not, in his turn, revile, wins a twofold victory.  S.i.221f; cf.  S.iv.201.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vejayanta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vejayanta.&lt;/b&gt; A pāsāda belonging to Sakka.  When Moggallāna visited Sakka to discover if he had fully understood the Buddha's teaching in the Cūlatanhā sankhaya Sutta, Sakka tried to evade his questions by showing him this palace.  It has one hundred towers, each seven stories high, with seven nymphs in each storey, waited on by seven attendants.  The palace appeared in Tāvatimsa on the day of Sakka's decisive victory over the Asuras.  Moggallāna allowed himself to be shown round, and then, with his big toe, he made the palace quake and rock.  M.i.252f.; cf.  Thag.  1196f.; ThagA.ii.184. The palace was also made to rock by the novice Sangharakkhita (q.v.) on the day he joined the Order (DA.ii.558).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The palace is one thousand leagues high, and is so called because it arose in the hour of victory (J.i.203).  It is decked with banners, each three hundred leagues long banners of gold on jewelled staffs and vice versa; and the whole palace is built of the seven precious substances.  It arose as the result of the rest house built by Sakka, in his birth as Magha, for the use of the multitude (DhA.i.273; cf.  DA.iii.698).  When the Buddha visited Tāvatimsa with Nanda, Sakka was in the palace with his crimson footed (kakutapādiniyo) nymphs and came forward with them to greet him.  The nymphs had given oil for the massaging of Kassapa Buddha's feet, hence the colour of their own feet.  SNA.i.274.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When King Sādhīna of Mithilā went to Tāvatimsa, he lived, according to human computation, seven hundred years in Vejayanta (J.iv.357).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vejayantapāsāda is illustrated on the Bharhut Tope.  Cunningham, Bharhut Tope, p.  137.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vejayanta.&lt;/b&gt; A chariot owned by Sakka, one hundred and fifty leagues in length (DA.ii.481; SA.i.261; J.i.202), and drawn by one thousand horses, with Mātali as charioteer (S.i.224).  Sakka rode into battle in this chariot (J.i.202), and it was sent to fetch distinguished humans to Tāvatimsa e.g., Nimi, Guttila and Sādhīna (q.v.).  The Sudhābhojana Jātaka (J.v.408f ) contains a description of the chariot with its pole of gold and its framework overlaid with gilt representations of various animals and birds.  When the chariot travelled the whole world was filled with the sound of its wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vejayanta.&lt;/b&gt; The chief of the eighty four thousand chariots owned by Mahāsudassana (S.iii.145; D.ii.187).  The navel of its wheels was made of sapphire, the spokes of seven kinds of precious things, the rim of coral, the axle of silver, etc.  SA.ii.237.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
  <entry>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vedanā Sutta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Vedanā Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; On how diversity of feelings arise because of the diversity in elements.  S.ii.141.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Vedanā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; Diversity of feelings arises because of the diversity in elements and not vice versa.  S.ii.142.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Vedanā Sutta.  &lt;/b&gt; Feeling that is born of sense contact is not abiding but fleeting.  S.ii.247.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Vedanā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to the comprehension of the three kinds of feelings.  S.iv.255.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Vedanā Sutta.&lt;/b&gt; The cultivation of the Noble Eightfold Path is for the full comprehension of the three kinds of feelings.  S.v.57.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</entry>
