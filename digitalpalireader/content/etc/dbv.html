				<p class="text">The Lord said to the monks: “Imagine that the whole earth was covered with water, and that a man was to throw a yoke with a hole in it into the water. &nbsp;Blown by the wind, that yoke would drift north, south, east and west. &nbsp;Now suppose that once in a hundred years a blind turtle was to rise to the surface. &nbsp;What would be the chances of that turtle putting his head through the hole in the yoke as he rose to the surface once in a hundred years?” ‘It would be very unlikely, Lord.’ “Well, it is just as unlikely that one will be born as a human being. &nbsp;It is just as unlikely that a Tathagata, a Noble One, a fully enlightened Buddha, should appear in the world. &nbsp;And it is just as unlikely that the Dhamma and discipline of the Tathagata should be proclaimed. &nbsp;But now you have been born as a human being, a Tathagata has appeared and the Dhamma has been proclaimed. &nbsp;Therefore, strive to realize the Four Noble Truths.”</p>

				<p class="text">For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher’s instruction and who lives in harmony with it, his thinking is: ‘The Teacher is the Lord, I am the disciple. &nbsp;The Lord knows, I do not.’ For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and who lives in harmony with it, the Teacher's instruction is nourishing and strength-giving. &nbsp;The thinking is: ‘Gladly would I have my skin, bone and sinews wither and my flesh dry up, if only I can struggle until I win that which can be won by human effort.’ And for a disciple who has faith in the Teacher’s instruction and who lives in harmony with it, one of two results can be expected; profound knowledge here and now, or if there is any basis for rebirth remaining, the state of Non-Returning.</p>

				<p class="text">Unsurpassed is the Lord’s way of teaching the Dhamma concerning one’s proper moral conduct. &nbsp;One should be honest and faithful, without deception, chatter, hinting or belittling, not always ready to add gain to gain, but with the sense-doors guarded, moderate in food, a promoter of peace, observant, active and strenuous in effort, a meditator, mindful, with proper conversation, steady-going, resolute and sensible, not hankering after sense pleasures, but mindful and prudent. &nbsp;This is the unsurpassed teaching concerning a person's proper ethical conduct. &nbsp;This, the Lord fully comprehends and beyond it nothing lies to be further comprehended. &nbsp;And in such matters there is no other monk or brahman who is greater or more enlightened than the Lord concerning one's moral conduct.</p>

				<p class="text">These seven conditions overwhelm an angry man or woman and are gratifying and helpful to their rival. &nbsp;What seven? &nbsp;One may wish this of a rival: ‘I wish he was ugly.’ And why? &nbsp;One does not like an attractive rival. &nbsp;Overwhelmed and undermined by anger that person becomes ugly even though he is bathed, anointed, with trimmed hair and beard and clad in clean clothes.</p>
				<p class="text">Then one may wish this of a rival: ‘I hope he sleeps badly.’ And why? &nbsp;One does not like a rival to sleep well. &nbsp;Overwhelmed and undermined by anger that person sleeps badly even though he is lying on a bed spread with fleecy cover, spread with white blankets and woolen cover embroidered with flowers, covered by an antelope skin, with awning above and red cushions at each end.</p>
				<p class="text">Again, one may wish this of a rival: ‘I hope he becomes poor.’ And why? &nbsp;One does not like a rich rival. &nbsp;Overwhelmed and undermined by anger that person becomes poor because, owning whatever wealth he has acquired by energetic striving, won by strength of arm and sweat of brow, justly and lawfully, the king will order them all sent to the royal treasury because he is overwhelmed by anger.</p>
				<p class="text">Once again, one may wish this of a rival: ‘I hope he was without fame.’ And why? &nbsp;One does not like a famous rival. &nbsp;Overwhelmed and undermined by anger, whatever reputation that person has earned falls away because he is overwhelmed by anger.</p>

				<p class="text">And finally, one may wish this of a rival: ‘I hope he goes to hell.’ And why? &nbsp;One does not like a rival to go to heaven. &nbsp;Overwhelmed and undermined by anger, that person misconducts himself in body, speech, and mind and thus goes to hell himself. &nbsp;These are the seven conditions that overwhelm an angry man or woman and are gratifying and helpful to their rival.</p>

				<p class="text">And concerning one who words are impure but who is pure in deed, how should malice be put away? &nbsp;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pond overgrown with mossy slime and water plants. &nbsp;He would dive into the pond, scatter the water plants this way and that, cup his hands, drink, and then go his way refreshed. &nbsp;In the same way, one whose words are impure but who is pure in deed, his words ought to be disregarded. &nbsp;Think instead about his ways that are pure.</p>
				<p class="text">And what of one whose words and deed are both impure, but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm? &nbsp;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, exhausted, wearied craving and thirsty, were to come upon a puddle in a cow's footprint. &nbsp;He might think: ‘If I drink from this puddle using my hands or a cup I will stir up the mud and make it unfit to drink. &nbsp;I will crouch down on all fours, bend low and drink, as does a cow?’ Then he does this. &nbsp;In the same way, one whose word and deed are both impure but who occasionally attains mental clarity and calm from time to time, his words and deeds ought to be disregarded. &nbsp;Think only of his clarity and calm.</p>
				<p class="text">And what of one whose words and deeds are both impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm? &nbsp;Suppose a sick ailing and grievously ill man was going along a highway with no village in front or behind, unable to get proper food, medicine or attention, or even a guide to the next village. &nbsp;If another man were to see him, he might feel pity and he might say to himself: ‘This poor man! &nbsp;He should get help or he will suffer to his detriment.’ In the same way, for one whose ways are impure and who cannot even occasionally attain mental clarity and calm, pity, compassion and commiseration ought to arise and you should think: ‘This poor man! &nbsp;He should give up the bad and develop the good, or else after death he will have a bad rebirth.’</p>
				<p class="text">And concerning one whose words and deeds are both pure and who has mental clarity and calm, how should malice be put away? &nbsp;Suppose a man, tortured and overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty were to come upon a pool of sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place shaded by all kinds of trees. &nbsp;He would dive into the pond, bathe, drink and then come out and lie in the shade. &nbsp;In the same way, of this person, think about this person’s pure words, deeds and his mental clarity and calm.”</p>

				<p class="text">You should recollect the Dhamma like this: ‘Beautifully taught is the Lord’s Dhamma, immediately apparent, timeless, of the nature of a personal invitation, progressive, to be attained by the wise, each for themselves.’</p>
				<p class="text">You should recollect the Sangha like this: ‘Happily and straightly faring are the Lord’s disciples, correctly and methodically faring are the Lord’s disciples, namely, the four pairs of individuals, the eight types of persons. &nbsp;These disciples of the Lord are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts and salutation with folded hands; they are an incomparable source of goodness in the world.’</p>
				<p class="text">You should recollect your own virtues as being complete, whole, unspotted, untarnished, freedom-giving, as being praised by the wise, pure and leading to concentration.</p>
				<p class="text">You should recollect your own generosity like this: ‘It is a gain for me. &nbsp;Indeed, it is a great gain, that amidst those overcome by meanness, I live at home with the mind cleansed of meanness. &nbsp;I am open-handed, pure-handed, delighting in sharing, one to ask a favour of, one who rejoices in giving.’</p>
				<p class="text">Further, you should recollect the gods in this way: ‘There are the gods of the Four Great Kings, the Thirty-three Gods, the gods of Yama, the gods of delight, the gods who delight in creation, those who have power over the creations of others, those in the company of Brahma and those beyond that. &nbsp;I, too, have the faith, the virtue, the learning, the generosity, and the wisdom by which these gods, on dying here, were reborn there in heaven.’</p>
				<p class="text">At a time when a noble disciple recollects all these things, his mind is free from greed, hatred and delusion. &nbsp;At that time, his mind is straight and fixed upon those things, and with a straight mind he expresses the gladness of the good, the gladness of the Dhamma, and the gladness that goes with Dhamma. &nbsp;In one like this gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated. &nbsp;This is said of a person like this: ‘The noble disciple who recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, who recollects virtue, generosity and the gods – that disciple walks evenly among those who dwell unevenly.’</p>

				<p class="text">There are four types of people who should be known as enemies disguised as friends; the greedy person, one who speaks but does not act, the flatterer and the squanderer. &nbsp;The greedy person is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He is greedy, he gives little and asks for much, if he does what he should, it is only out of fear, and he pursues his own interests only. &nbsp;He who speaks but does not act is an enemy disguised as friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He reminds you of the good he did for you in the past, he talks of good he will do for you in the future, he tries to win your favour with empty words, and when the opportunity to help you arises, he pleads helplessness. &nbsp;The flatterer is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He encourages you to do wrong, he discourages you from doing right, he praises you to your face and speaks ill of you behind your back. &nbsp;The squanderer is an enemy disguised as a friend for four reasons also. &nbsp;He is your companion when you drink, when you frequent the streets at untimely hours, when you haunt low shows and fairs, and he is your companion when you gamble.</p>
				<p class="text">There are four kinds of good-hearted people who should be known as true friends; the helper, the consistent friend, one who gives good counsel, and one who sympathizes. &nbsp;The helper is a true friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He guards you when you are off your guard, he guards your property when you are off your guard, he comforts you when you are afraid, and when something has to be done, he gives you twice what you require. &nbsp;The consistent friend is a true friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He tells you his secrets, he keeps the secrets you tell him, in trouble he does not forsake you, and he would even lay down his life for you. &nbsp;The friend who gives good counsel is a true friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He discourages you from doing wrong, he encourages you to do good, he tells you things you have not heard, and he points out the way to heaven. &nbsp;The friend who sympathizes is a true friend for four reasons. &nbsp;He is sad at your misfortunes, he rejoices at your good fortune, he restrains others from speaking ill of you, and he commends those who speak well of you.</p>

					Once, the Lord was staying near Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the great forest. &nbsp;And at that time, the brahmin Karanapalin constructed a building for the Licchavis. &nbsp;And Karanapalin saw the brahmin Pingiyanin coming in the distance, and as he approached, he said: “Pray, now, from where comes your honour Pingiyanin so early in the day?”
					<br />
					“I come from the presence of the monk Gotama.”
					<br />
					“Well, what do you think of his clarity of wisdom? &nbsp;Do you think he is a wise man?”
					<br />
					“But what am I compared to him? &nbsp;Who am I to judge his clarity? &nbsp;Is it not only one like him who could judge the monk Gotama’s clarity of wisdom?”
					<br />
					“High indeed is the praise that you give the monk Gotama.”
					<br />
					“But what am I compared to him? &nbsp;Who am I to praise the monk Gotama? &nbsp;Truly he is praised by the praised. &nbsp;He is the highest amongst gods and humans.”
					<br />
					“But what good do you see in him that you have such faith in him?”
					<br />
					“Just as when a man is completely satisfied with some delicious flavour, and longs not for other flavours that are poor – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, one longs not for the talk of others, the crowd, other recluses or Brahmins. &nbsp;Just as a man overcome by hunger and weakness may come across a honey cake, and whenever he tastes it, he enjoys the sweet, delicious flavour – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, one experiences sweetness and serenity of mind. &nbsp;Just as a man may come across a stick of yellow or red sandalwood, and wherever he smells it, at the root, in the middle or at the top, he comes across an exceedingly fair, delicious fragrance – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, all grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair just vanish away. &nbsp;Just as a man tortured by heat, overcome by heat, wearied, craving and thirsty, might come to a pool of clear, sweet, cool, limpid water, a lovely resting place, and might plunge in, bathe, drink, and allay all woe, fatigue and fretting – even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts, all woe, fatigue and fretting is wholly allayed.”

				<p class="text">Malunkyaputta said to the Lord: “Sir, as I was meditating, this thought came to me: ‘Those speculative views about the world, whether it is finite or infinite, whether it is both or neither; those speculative views about whether the soul is the same as the body or different from it; those speculative views about whether the Tathagata exists after death or does not, whether he both exists and does not exist, whether he neither exists nor does not exist; the Lord has not addressed these views, he has sidestepped them and ignored them.’ Sir, if you do not explain these views for me, I will leave this training. &nbsp;If you know the answers to these questions, you should explain them to me. &nbsp;And if you don't know, then it would be honest and say so.”</p>
				<p class="text">“But Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come, be my disciple, and I will answer all these questions for you?’ ”</p>
				<p class="text">“No, sir.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Then, did you ever say to me: ‘I will become your disciple only if you answer all these questions?’ ”</p>
				<p class="text">“No, sir.”</p>
				<p class="text">“So, who are you and what is your complaint, you foolish man? &nbsp;If one were to say that they would not become my disciple until all these views had been explained by me, he might be dead before it could be done. &nbsp;It is as if a man had been shot by a poisoned arrow and his friends might get a doctor to help him. &nbsp;And he might say: ‘Wait! &nbsp;I do not want the arrow removed until I know the name of the man who shot it, what caste he is, whether he is short or tall, fat or thin. &nbsp;I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow that shot the arrow was a spring bow, a crossbow or a longbow. &nbsp;I do not want the arrow removed until I know whether the bow was made from reed, wood or bamboo, or whether the head of the arrow was a calf-tooth head, an ordinary head, a jagged head or an iron head.’ Long before all these questions could be answered, that man would be dead. &nbsp;In the same way, if someone were to say that they would not become my disciple until all the questions about whether the world is infinite or not were answered, they might be dead before it could be done. &nbsp;Living the holy life could not be said to depend upon whether the world is infinite or not, whether it is both infinite and finite, whether it is neither infinite nor finite or any of the other questions. &nbsp;Whether the world is infinite or not, there is birth, there is aging, there is dying, there is grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, and it is for the ending of this that I teach. &nbsp;Therefore, understand as not explained what has not been explained by me, and understand as explained what has been explained by me. &nbsp;And what has not been explained by me? &nbsp;All these speculative views that you ask about. &nbsp;And why? &nbsp;Because it is not connected with the goal, it is not fundamental to the holy life, it does not conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge or to Nirvana. &nbsp;And what has been explained by me? &nbsp;The Four Noble Truths. &nbsp;And why? &nbsp;Because it is connected with the goal, it is fundamental to the holy life, it does conduce to good, to turning away, to fading, to calming, to higher knowledge and to Nirvana.”</p>

				<p class="text">The noble quality of love should be thought about like this: ‘One concerned only with his own welfare, without concern for others, cannot achieve success in this world or happiness in the next. &nbsp;How then can one wishing to help all beings but not having loved himself succeed in attaining Nirvana? &nbsp;And if you wish to lead all beings to Nirvana, you should begin by wishing for their mundane welfare here and now.’ One should think: ‘I cannot provide for the welfare and happiness of others merely by wishing it. &nbsp;Let me make an effort to accomplish it.’ One should think: ‘Now I support them by promoting their welfare and happiness, and later they will be my companions in sharing the Dhamma.’ Then one should think: ‘Without these beings, I could not perfect the requisites of enlightenment. &nbsp;Because they are the reason for practicing and perfecting all the Buddha-like qualities, these beings are for me the highest field of merit, the incomparable basis for planting wholesome roots, and thus the ultimate object of reverence.’ So one should arouse an especially strong inclination towards promoting the welfare of all beings. &nbsp;And why should love be developed towards all beings? &nbsp;Because it is the foundation of compassion. &nbsp;For when one delights in providing for the welfare and happiness of other beings with an unbounded heart, the desire to remove their afflictions and suffering becomes strongly and firmly established. &nbsp;And compassion is the pre-eminent quality in Buddhahood; it is its basis, its foundation, its root, its head and its chief.</p>

				<p class="text">Giving up worldly desires, one dwells with a mind purified and free from worldly desires. &nbsp;Giving up ill-will and hatred, one dwells with a mind filled with compassion and love for the welfare of all beings, and purifies the mind of ill-will and hatred. &nbsp;Giving up sloth and laziness, one perceives the light, and mindful and clearly comprehending, purifies the mind of sloth and laziness. &nbsp;Giving up restlessness and worry and remaining inwardly calm, one purifies the mind of restlessness and worry. &nbsp;Giving up doubt, one dwells having crossed over doubt, and without uncertainty as to what is skillful, purifies the mind of doubt.</p>
				<p class="text">Just as a man who had borrowed money to develop his business, and whose business had prospered, might repay the money and have enough left over to support a wife, and would think: ‘Before I was in debt, but now I am free from debt,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who was sick and suffering, without appetite and weak, might in time regain his health, appetite and strength, and would think: ‘Before I was sick, but now I am healthy,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who is imprisoned might, after a time, be freed without any confiscation of his property, and would think: ‘Before I was imprisoned, but now I am free,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a man who is enslaved, not his own master, controlled by another and unable to do as he desired, and who in time would be emancipated, would think: ‘I was a slave, but now I am emancipated,’ and would be glad and happy because of that; just as a traveller carrying goods and wealth might find himself in a wilderness with little food and much danger, and after a time, might arrive safe and sound at the edge of a village, and would think: ‘Before I was in danger, but now I am safe,’ and would be glad and happy because of that.</p>
				<p class="text">In the same way, as long as the five hindrances are not given up, one feels indebted, sick, imprisoned, enslaved, lost in the wilderness. &nbsp;But when the five hindrances are given up, one feels free from debt, healthy, free, emancipated and safe. &nbsp;And when one knows that these five hindrances are given up, gladness arises, from gladness comes joy, because of joy the body is tranquil, with a tranquil body one is happy, and the mind of one who is happy becomes concentrated.</p>

				<p class="text">
					“O elephant, do not strike a truly great being,
					<br />
					For to do so is painful indeed.
					<br />
					<br />
					For one who slays a great being, O elephant,

					There is no good rebirth, when one departs from here.
					<br />
					<br />
					Be not proud, be not reckless,
					<br />
					Or there will be no good rebirth.
					<br />
					Act in such a way as to have a good rebirth.”
					<br />
					<br />
					Then Nalagiri took dust from the Lord’s feet with his trunk, sprinkled it over his own head, and then backed away, bowing, and keeping his gaze on the Lord. &nbsp;He returned to the stable and stood in his own place, and in this way was finally tamed. &nbsp;Then people at that time sang this verse:
					<br />
					<br />
					“Some are tamed by sticks, by goads or by whips.
					<br />
					The elephant was tamed by the great seer,
					<br />
					Without stick or weapon.”
					<br />
					<br />
					People disparaged and criticized Devadatta widely, saying: “This Devadatta is evil and inauspicious in that he tried to murder the monk Gotama who is of such great psychic power and majesty.” And Devadatta's reputation declined while the Lord’s grew.

				<p class="text">Suppose a king or royal minister has never heard lute music before. &nbsp;But one day he does hear it and he says: ‘Good man, tell me, what is that enchanting and delightful, intoxicating, ravishing and enthralling sound?’ Then they say to him: ‘That Sir, is the music of the lute.’ So he says: ‘Go, bring me that lute.’ So they bring it to him but he says: ‘Enough of this lute. &nbsp;Bring me the music.’ Then they say to him: ‘Sir, this lute consists of many parts; the belly, the skin, the handle, the frame, the string, the bridge and the effort of the player. &nbsp;And it makes the sound because of them. &nbsp;The sound is because of these various and many parts.’ Then the king breaks the lute into a hundred pieces, splinters it again, burns it, puts the ashes in a heap and winnows them in the wind or washes them away in water in order to find the music. &nbsp;Having done this he finds no music and says: ‘A poor thing indeed is a lute; whatever a lute may be. &nbsp;The world is deceived by such things.’ In the same way, one investigating the body as far as the body goes, investigating feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness as far as they go, finds no ‘I’ , no ‘I am’, no ‘Mine.’</p>

				<p class="text">Venerable Tissa, the nephew of the Lord’s father, spoke to a number of monks and said: “Friends, my body is as if drugged, things have become dim to my eyes, and the Dhamma is no longer clear to me. &nbsp;Sloth and laziness possess my mind and I live the holy life without joy. &nbsp;I waver in the teachings.” So, those monks went to the Lord and told him what Tissa had said, and the Lord addressed one monk saying: “Go, monk, and in my name tell Tissa to come and speak to me.” So that monk did as he was asked and when Tissa came, the Lord said to him: “Is it true as they say that your body is as if drugged, that things have become dim to your eyes, that the Dhamma is no longer clear to you, that sloth and laziness possess your mind, that you live the holy life without joy, and that you waver in the teachings?”</p>
				<p class="text">“That is true, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Now concerning this, what do you think, Tissa? &nbsp;If one is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, then when the body alters and changes do not grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?”</p>
				<p class="text">“Yes, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“And is it not the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?"</p>
				<p class="text">"Yes, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Well said, Tissa! &nbsp;Well said! &nbsp;Now what do you think? &nbsp;If one is free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever and craving, then when the body alters and changes then do grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair arise?”</p>
				<p class="text">“No Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“And is it the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness?”</p>
				<p class="text">“It is, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Well said, Tissa! &nbsp;Well said! &nbsp;Now, what do you think? &nbsp;Are the body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
				<p class="text">“They are impermanent, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“So, seeing this, the instructed noble disciple turns away from these five aggregates. &nbsp;Turning away from them, passions fade, and with the fading of passions, he is free and he knows: ‘Rebirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done; there is no more of this.’ Suppose there are two men, one a skilled traveller and the other not. &nbsp;And the unskilled traveller asks the way from the skilled one. &nbsp;He replies: ‘Yes, my good man, this is the way. &nbsp;Continue for a while and you will see a fork in the road. &nbsp;Take the right hand path. &nbsp;Go on a little, and you will come to a forest. &nbsp;Continue for a while more, and you will come to a marshy swamp. &nbsp;Go a little further, and you will see a great cliff. &nbsp;Go further still and you will see a beautiful stretch of open ground.’ I use this parable to illustrate my meaning, and this is the meaning. &nbsp;The man unskilled in travel represents ordinary people, and the man skilled in travel represents the Tathagata, the Noble One, the fully enlightened Buddha. &nbsp;The fork in the road is the state of wavering, the left fork being the false eightfold path and the right fork being the Noble Eightfold Path. &nbsp;The thick forest is ignorance, the marshy swamp is desires, and the great cliff is irritation and despair. &nbsp;The delightful stretch of open ground is Nirvana. &nbsp;So be of good cheer, Tissa! &nbsp;Be of good cheer! &nbsp;I will counsel you, I will support you, I will instruct you.”</p>

				<p class="text">The Lord said to the monks: “Body is not self. &nbsp;If it were, it would not be liable to affliction, and one could say: ‘Let my body be like this. &nbsp;Let not my body be like that.’ But since the body is not the self, it is liable to affliction, and one cannot say: ‘Let my body be like this. &nbsp;Let not my body be like that.’ And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. &nbsp;What do you think? &nbsp;Is body permanent or impermanent?”</p>
				<p class="text">“Impermanent, sir.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Now, is what is impermanent painful or pleasant?”</p>
				<p class="text">“Painful, sir.”</p>
				<p class="text">“Now, is it fit to regard what is impermanent and painful like this: ‘This is mine, this is I, this is my self?’ ”</p>
				<p class="text">“No, sir.”</p>
				<p class="text">“And it is the same with feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. &nbsp;So, any kind of body, feeling, perception, mental constructs or consciousness, whether past, present or future, whether gross or subtle, whether internal or external, whether inferior or superior, whether far or near, must with right understanding be regarded thus: ‘This is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.’ When a noble disciple has heard this and sees this, he becomes detached from body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. &nbsp;Being detached, passions fade, with the fading of passions he is free, and when he is free he knows he is free. &nbsp;He knows: ‘Birth is ended, the holy life has been lived, what has had to be done is done, there is no more of this.’ ”</p>

				<p class="text">At that time, a certain monk named Thera was living alone and commending such a life. &nbsp;He entered the village alone, he returned alone, he sat alone and walked alone. &nbsp;So a number of other monks went and told the Lord this, and he asked them to call Thera into his presence. &nbsp;When he came, the Lord asked him: “Is it true as they say that you are living quite alone and that you commend such a life?”</p>
				<p class="text">“That is so, Lord.”</p>
				<p class="text">“In what way do you live and commend?”</p>
				<p class="text">“I enter the village alone, I return alone, I sit alone and walk alone.”</p>
				<p class="text">“That is living alone, it is true, Thera. &nbsp;But I will tell you a way of bringing to perfection the solitary life. &nbsp;When the past is put away, when the future is given up and when there is no craving and desire in the present, then the solitary life has been perfected in full.”</p>

				<p class="text">You should train yourselves like this, thinking: ‘We will be contended with whatever robes, food, shelter or medicine we get. &nbsp;We will be contented with what we get and do nothing unseemly in order to get these things. &nbsp;If we are not able to get robes, food and so on, we will not be perturbed, and if we do get them we will use them without clinging and infatuation, doing no wrong in order to get them, seeing the danger in them and being wise to escaping from it.’ This is how you should train yourselves.</p>

					Since I went forth
					<br />
					From home into homelessness
					<br />
					I have never been aware of having
					<br />
					Any ignoble or hateful thoughts, such as:
					<br />
					<br />
					‘May they be killed. &nbsp;May they be slaughtered.
					<br />
					May they come to harm.’
					<br />
					Such thoughts have not crossed my mind
					<br />
					For a long time.
					<br />
					<br />
					On the contrary, I am aware of thoughts of love,
					<br />
					Infinite and well-developed,
					<br />
					Practiced in due order
					<br />
					As taught by the Buddha.
					<br />
					<br />
					I am a friend to all, a helper to all,
					<br />
					I am sympathetic to all beings.
					<br />
					I develop a mind full of love
					<br />
					And delight always in harmlessness.
					<br />
					<br />
					I gladden my mind
					<br />
					I make it immovable and unshakable.
					<br />
					I develop the divine states
					<br />
					Not cultivated by evil people.

				<p class="text">It can be understood by a person’s conversation whether or not he is competent to discuss things. &nbsp;If, on being questioned, a person evades the question, changes the subject, displays anger, malice or sulkiness, then he is incompetent to discuss things. &nbsp;If a person does not do these things, then he is competent to discuss. &nbsp;Yet again, it can be understood by a person’s conversation whether or not he is competent to discuss. &nbsp;If, on being asked a question, a person loads scorn on a questioner, beats him down, laughs at him and tries to catch him up when he falters, then he is incompetent to discuss things. &nbsp;If a person does not do such things then he is competent to discuss things.</p>

				<p class="text">And the Lord said to Magandiya: “It is like a man born blind, who cannot see either color or shape, the even or the uneven, the stars, the sun or the moon. &nbsp;He might hear someone speaking of the pleasure of a lovely, unstained, pure white cloth, and start searching for one. &nbsp;But someone might deceive him by giving him a greasy, grimy, coarse robe and say: ‘My good man, this is lovely, unstained, pure white cloth.’ The blind man might take it and put it on. &nbsp;Then his friends and relations might get a physician or surgeon to make medicine for him, potions, purgatives, ointments and treatment for his eyes. &nbsp;Because of this he might regain his sight and restore his vision. &nbsp;Then the desire and attachment he had for that greasy robe would go, he would no longer consider the man who gave it to him a friend. &nbsp;He might even consider him an enemy, thinking: ‘For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by this man.’ Even so, if I were to teach you Dhamma, saying: ‘This is that health, this is that Nirvana,’ you might come to know health, you might see Nirvana. &nbsp;With the arising of that vision, the desire and attachment you had for the five clinging aggregates might go. &nbsp;You might even think: ‘For a long time I have been defrauded, deceived and cheated by the mind, by clinging to body, feeling, perception, mental constructs and consciousness. &nbsp;Conditioned by this clinging there was becoming; conditioned by becoming there was birth, conditioned by birth, old age, dying, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair came into being. &nbsp;This is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.’ And Magandiya said to the Lord: “I have confidence that if the good Gotama were to teach me Dhamma, I could rise from my seat no longer blind.”</p>
